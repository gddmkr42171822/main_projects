THE PLOUGHMAN 

UNDER the long fell's stony eaves 
The ploughman, going up and down. 
Ridge after ridge man's tide-mark leaves, 
And turns the hard grey soil to brown. 

Striding, he measures out the earth 
In lines of life, to rain and sun; 
And every year that comes to birth 
Sees him still striding on and on. 

The seasons change, and then return ; 
Yet still, in blind, unsparing ways, 
However I may shrink or yearn, 
The ploughman measures out my days. 

His acre brought forth roots last year; 
This year it bears the gleamy grain ; 
Next Spring shall seedling grass appear : 
Then roots and corn and grass again. 

Five times the young corn's pallid green 
I have seen spread and change and thrill ; 
Five times the reapers I have seen 
Go creeping up the far-off hill : 

And, as the unknowing ploughman climbs 

Slowly and inveterately, 

I wonder long how many times 

The corn will spring again for me.

ATLANTIS 

WHAT poets sang in Atlantis? Who can tell 
The epics of Atlantis or their names ? 
The sea hath its own murmurs, and sounds not 
The secrets of its silences beneath, 
And knows not any cadences enfolded 
When the last bubbles of Atlantis broke 
Among the quieting of its heaving floor. 

O, years and tides and leagues and all their billows 

Can alter not man's knowledge of men's hearts 

While trees and rocks and clouds include our being 

We know the epics of Atlantis still : 

A hero gave himself to lesser men, 

Who first misunderstood and murdered him, 

And then misunderstood and worshipped him ; 

A woman was lovely and men fought for her, 

Towns burnt for her, and men put men in bondage, 

But she put lengthier bondage on them all ; 

A wanderer toiled among all the isles 

That fleck this turning star of shifting sea, 

Or lonely purgatories of the mind, 

In longing for his home or his lost love. 

Poetry is founded on the hearts of men : 
Though in Nirvana or the Heavenly courts 
The principle of beauty shall persist, 
Its body of poetry, as the body of man, 
Is but a terrene form, a terrene use, 
That swifter being will not loiter with; 
And, when mankind is dead and the world cold, 
Poetry's immortality will pass.

A SURREY NIGHT 

THROUGH bare black oak-boughs spread afar 
I watch a sickle moon 
Follow a large and lonely star 
Beyond the low South Down. 

The thin light films a wider sky 
Than I have lived beneath ; 
The trees ebb out more distantly, 
Past delicate wild heath. 

But when the moonlight is so clear, 
And the sharp night so still, 
My thoughts will never settle here 
Upon this gentle hill ; 

For when the moonlight is so pale 
Above dark fields and woods, 
I only see my Northern vale 
And its steep solitudes ; 

The hard, lean fells against the night, 
Between the darker trees ; 
The high and distant farm-house light; 
The village stillnesses. 

I hear the larch-wood brook draw near, 
Lapper and lull and leap, 
In far-off night, that I would hear 
Before I go to sleep.

AVELINGLAS 

NOW whether land or water win, 
The sky will still be drear; 
There 's no place for King Avelin 
Who built his palace here. 

Between the river and the tide 

Only one street may stand, 

But once the streets were seven and wide 

Before men came to the sand. 

King Avelin steered out of the North, 
In the time of the swans' flight ; 
And whence his dark ships issued forth 
None knew but a fog-bank white. 

" This lonely haven is deep and clear, 
This land will hold my folk ; 
And I shall build my palace here, 
Beyond the Hairfair's yoke." 

His daughter had a golden gown 
That left her young neck bare, 
And in the tower beyond the town 
She washed her golden hair : 

Through the window-hole she bowed 
And dropped it in the sky; 
She dried it till that waving cloud 
Could make men's hearts beat high. 
6 



Qordon ^Bottomley 

She washed her hair, she combed her hair 

By night as well as day; 

She swung it on the midnight air 

To meet the rising spray. 

She combed, and wrought the waking spell 
Of the oldest wind on the sea 
" For then," she said, " the sea's swell 
Will bring a lover to me." 

The sea grew, the sky sank ; 
Streets made the long waves fret ; 
The river ran without a bank; 
The housewives' knees were wet. 

Tower and town, pine-wood and willow 
Melted as though by rain ; 
And once the trough of a piling billow 
Was paved with a golden mane. 

King Avelin, King Avelin 
Won to no kingly bier : 
Ah, where is now King Avelin 
Who built his palace here?

HOMUNCULUS IN PENUMBRA 

""\7[7"HEN I look down my limbs and moving 

V V breast 

I know that on a day these will commence 
To contradict my being that bids them be 
And sets the harmony by which they live. 
I love to cleanse them ; they reply to me, 
Exuding, sloughing, duteously renewing, 
For cleansing is the nature of their growth ; 
Yet in that day they shall deny my will, 
And turn to filth, refuse, and dirty water, 
While a dispersing sentience that was 1 
Stands close thereby in trouble, in travail 
With words those lips delay to utter in time, 
In awe-full agony lest that flesh dissolve 
Before I can get into it again. 

"And when I see it buried I shall cry out: 
If it is given to fire I shall have throes 
Of suffering, of unbearable regret, 
Longing, apprehension, that shall bind 
Yet, yet a little while the loosening wreaths 
Of sentience that are continent of me : 
Then shame and dread shall be the heart of me 
Because I have no body to hide my thoughts, 
That are being scanned, as if by unseen eyes, 
Perused and judged, inelu&ably judged, 
I shivering in that exposury 
Until dissemination is complete/'

THE PRIDE OF WESTMORELAND 

I MET a man of ninety-three 
Who took my hand in his, 
He took my hand and shook my hand 
And gave my wife a kiss ; 
"You've married the pride of Westmoreland " 
He said, and he looked his fill 
But a hearty man of ninety-three 
May kiss whomever he will. 

There 's a deal of truth and wisdom too 

In a man of ninety-three, 

Yet I did not need an aged man 

To find the maid for me ; 

When I married the pride of Westmoreland 

Youth's wisdom did not floor me 

I took my pick in Kendal town 

Like Harry the Eighth before me.

SONG 

THE maids went down to dip in the pool 
When the mirrored moon had cooled the water; 
But they never told the farmer's daughter, 
For they knew she would tell her mother, the fool, 
That the girls were out 
And awaking the water, 
With never a clout 
Though the night was cool.

SINAI 

I AM the Moses : I the mouth of God. 
God speaking by me, I must choose His mode. 
I understand how water stratifies : 
Smiting, I change the balance of its force. 
I recognize one element is all things, 
So of bland dew blend my primeval food, 
By morn and eve fulfil form's power to change. 
This is my chisel, stylus of the God 
My hammer this : my hammer is God's mind. 
I rule a naughty people and ignorant 
By the wise wilful power dictated in me. 
They watched me mount the mist with steps like threats; 
When the mist took me they were still as blindness, 
Uneasy and strained because I might return. 
When man conceives his nature, his relation 
To water, air, proud beasts, and fruiting trees. 
No law can hold him but the law he makes; 
His heart 's reluctant, restless, clear perception 
Only is simple and hard, is not avoided. 
This is my freedom ; this I figure as God 
To guide a folk who do not free themselves. 
A layer of stone can take law's burden, too, 
Show forth my way most definitely and coldly : 
Here in height's silence like my loneliness 
I strike the steel to unavoidable things.

WITH A PLAY 



WITHIN your Roman house, 
Your white and calm abode, 
Your Lares in their niche 
(Nereid, nymph, and god) 

Accept my alien vows 
Of friendship to their friend ; 
By bronze and marble rich 
You worship, yet I send 

(I the old koroplast) 
Image and figurine 
Enamelled with gaudy plumes, 
Corinthian, Pergamene. 

Keep them until the last 
Behind your Lares hidden : 
Such mimes were meant for tombs, 
Let them to yours be bidden.

NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1913 

O, CARTMEL bells ring soft to-night, 
And Cartmel bells ring clear, 
But I lie far away to-night, 
Listening with my dear ; 

Listening in a frosty land 

Where all the bells are still 

And the small-windowed bell-towers stand 

Dark under heath and hill, 

I thought that, with each dying year, 
As long as life should last 
The bells of Cartmel I should hear 
Ring out an aged past: 

The plunging, mingling sounds increase 
Darkness's depth and height, 
The hollow valley gains more peace 
And ancientness to-night : 

The loveliness, the fruitfulness, 
The power of life lived there 
Return, revive, more closely press 
Upon that midnight air. 

But many deaths have place in men 
Before they come to die ; 
Joys must be used and spent, and then 
Abandoned and passed by. 
13 



(jordon TSottomley 

Earth is not ours ; no cherished space 
Can hold us from life's flow. 
That bears us thither and thence by ways 
We knew not we should go. 

O, Cartmel bells ring loud, ring clear, 
Through midnight deep and hoar, 
A year new-born, and I shall hear 
The Cartmel bells no more.

ALL SOULS, 1914 

ON All Souls* night a year ago 
The gentle, ghostly dead 
Beat at my thoughts as moths beat low, 
Near to my quiet bed, 
Upon the pane ; I did not know 
What words they would have said. 

They were remote within my mind, 

Remote beyond the pane; 

Whether with evil wills or kind, 

They could not come again 

They had but swerved, as things resigned 

To learn return was vain. 

To-night the young uneasy dead 
Obscure the moonless night ; 
Their energies of hope and dread, 
Of passion and delight, 
Are still unspent ; their hearts unread 
Surge mutinous in flight. 

The life of earth beats in them yet, 
Their pulses are not done; 
They suffer by their nerves that fret 
To feel no wind nor sun ; 
They fade, but cannot yet forget 
Their conflicts are not won.

IN MEMORIAM 

A. M. W. 
SEPTEMBER, 1910 

(FOR A SOLEMN MUSIC) 

UT of a silence 
The voice of music speaks. 



When words have no more power, 
When tears can tell no more. 
The heart of all regret 
Is uttered by a falling wave 
Of melody. 

No more, no more 

The voice that gathered us 

Shall hush us with deep joy; 

But in this hush, 

Out of its silence, 

In the awaking of music, 

It shall return. 

For music can renew 

Its gladness and communion, 

Until we also sink, 

Where sinks the voice of music, 

Into a silence.

BROTHERS 

THEY lived together day and night. 
Two brothers, all alone: 
Six weeks had gone, and neighbours said- 
" We see no more than one. 

" Where is thy brother Charlie, Tom, 

And is he sick?" they said. 
Said Tom, that man so queer and quaint- 

" My brother 's still in bed." 

And every night they heard his voice, 

Down on the stairs below: 
"And are you still in bed and sick 

How are you, Charlie, now ? " 

They forced the doors and entered in, 

Found Charlie on the bed : 
" I see a dead man here alive," 

The old physician said. 

" For see the worms they bubble here 

In pools upon his flesh : 
They wag the beard that 's on his chin 

This body is not fresh." 

Then came a voice all sharp and clear, 

Down on the stairs below: 
"And are you still in bed and sick 

How are you, Charlie, now ? "

THE BELL 

IT is the bell of death I hear, 
Which tells me my own time is near; 
When I must join those quiet souls 
Where nothing lives but worms and moles ; 
And not come through the grass again. 
Like worms and moles, for breath or rain; 
Yet let none weep when my life 's through, 
For I myself have wept for few. 

The only things that knew me well 
Were children, dogs, and girls that fell ; 
I bought poor children cakes and sweets, 
Dogs heard my voice and danced the streets ; 
And, gentle to a fallen lass, 
I made her weep for what she was. 
Good men and women know not me, 
Nor love nor hate the mystery.

IN ENGLAND 

WE have no grass locked up in ice so fast 
That cattle cut their faces and at last. 
When it is reached, must lie them down and starve 
Their bleeding mouths being froze too hard to move. 
We have not that delirious state of cold 
That makes men warm and sing when in Death's hold, 
We have no roaring floods whose angry shocks 
Can kill the fishes dashed against their rocks. 
We have no winds that cut down street by street, 
As easy as our scythes can cut down wheat. 
No mountains here to spew their burning hearts 
Into the valleys, on our human parts. 
No earthquakes here, that ring church bells afar, 
A hundred miles from where those earthquakes are. 
We have no cause to set our dreaming eyes, 
Like Arabs, on fresh streams in Paradise. 
We have no wilds to harbour men that tell 
More murders than they can remember well. 
No woman here shall wake from her night's rest, 
And find a snake is sucking at her breast. 
Though I have travelled many and many a mile, 
And had a man to black my boots and smile 
With teeth that had less bone in them than gold 
Give me this England now, for all my world.

JOVE WARNS US 

JOVE warns us with his lightning first, 
Before he sends his thunder; 
Before the cock begins to crow, 

He claps his wings down under. 
But I, who go to see a maid, 

This springtime in the morning, 
Fall under every spell she has, 
Without a word of warning. 

She little thinks what charms her breath 

To cunning eyes reveal ; 
The waves that down her body glide, 

That from her bosom steal. 
Her moth-like plumpness caught my eye, 

I watched it like a spider ; 
By her own hair my web is made, 

To fasten me beside her.

ANGEL AND MYSTERY 

LO, I, that once was Fear, that hears 
His own forgotten breath, and fears 
The breath of something else is heard 
Am now bold Love, to dare the word ; 
No timid mouse am I, before 
Hell cross a moonbeam on the floor. 
So, sit thou close, and I will pour 
Into that rosy shell, thy ear, 
My deep-sea passion ; let me swear 
There 's nothing in this world as fair 
As thy sweet face that does, and will, 
Retain its baby roundness still : 
With those two suns, thine eyes, that keep 
Their light from clouds till Night brings sleep. 
Forget my features, only see 
The soul in them that burns for thee ; 
And never let it cross thy mind 
That I am ugly for my kind ; 
Although the world may well declare, 
" One is an angel sweet and fair ; 
But what it is that sits so close, 
Must rest with God He only knows."

MY ESTATE 

I HAVE four loves, four loves are mine, 
My wife who makes all beauty be, 
Tom Squire and Master Candleshine, 
And then my grey dog Timothy. 

My wife makes bramble-berry pies, 
And she is bright as bramble dew, 

She knows the way the weather flies, 
And tells me every thing to do. 

Tom Squire he is my neighbour man, 
His apples fall upon my grass, 

And in the morning, when we can, 
We say good-morning as we pass. 

And Master Candleshine the True, 
Considering some fault of mine, 

Says " Had it been for me to do, 
It had been hard for Candleshine." 

When I have thought all things that be, 
And drop the latch and climb the stair, 

And want an eye for company, 
My grey dog Timothy is there. 

My loves are one and two and three 
And four they are, good loves of mine, 

Tom Squire, my grey dog Timothy, 
My wife and Master Candleshine.

ON READING THE MS. OF DOROTHY 
WORDSWORTH'S JOURNALS 

TO-DAY I read the poet's sister's book, 
She who so comforted those Grasmere days 
When song was at the flood, and thence I took 
A larger note of fortitude and praise. 

And in her ancient fastness beauty stirred, 
And happy faith was in my heart again, 
Because the virtue of a simple word 
Was durable above the lives of men. 

For reading there that quiet record made 
Of skies and hills, domestic hours, and free 
Traffic of friends, and song, and duty paid, 
I touched the wings of immortality.

JUNE DANCE 1 

THE chestnut cones were in the lanes, 
Blushing, and eyed with ebony, 
And young oak-apples lovingly 
Clung to their stems with rosy veins 
Threading their glossy amber ; still 
As wind may be, among the bloom 
Of lilac and the burning broom 
The dear wind moved deliciously, 
And stayed upon the fragrant hill 
And lightened on the sea ; 
And brushed the nettles nodding through 
The budding globes of cloudy may, 
And wavelike flowed upon the blue 
Flowers of the woods. 

It was a day 

When pearled blossom of peach and pear 
Of blossoming season made an end, 
Drifting along the sunlight, rare 
Of beauty as thoughts between friend and friend 
That have no cunning, but merely know 
The way of truth for the heart is so. 

It was such a time at the birth of June, 
When the day was hushed at the hour of noon, 
And whispering leaves gave out a tune 
Ghostly as moves the bodiless moon 
High in the full-day skies of June, 

1 Written 1908, re-written 1916. 

29 



John TDrinkwater 

That they passed, a throng 

Of toilers whose eyes 

Were dull with toiling, passed along 

By a path that lies 

Between the city of mean emprise 

And a forest set in mellow lands, 

Far out from the city of broken hands. 

Meanly clad, with bodies worn, 

They came upon the forest hour, 

From open fields of springing corn 

To cloistered shades 

They passed, from June light to June bower, 

Tall men, and maids 

Deep-bosomed, apt for any seed 

That life should passionately sow, 

Yet pale and troubled of a creed 

Cried out by men who nothing know 

Of joy's diviner excellence. 

Along the silent glades they stept, 

Till, flowing in each drowsy sense, 

June came upon them, and they slept. 

Beneath cool clustered branch and bloom, 
Littered with stars of amethyst, 
Sun-arrows glancing through the gloom, 
They slept ; the lush young bracken kissed 
The tired forms. Ah, wellaway, 
Within so wide a peace to see 
Fellows who measure every day 
Merely the roads of misery. 

Tall men, deep-bosomed maids were they, 
As who should face the world and run 

30 



John ^Drinkwater 

Fleet-footed down the laughing way, 
With brows set fearless to the sun, 
But slackened were the rippling thews 
And all clean moods of courage dead, 
Defeated by ignoble use 
And sullen dread. 

So in the sweet June-tide they slept, 
Nor any dream of healing deep 
Came over them ; heart-sick they kept 
A troubled sleep ; 
Companions of calamity. 
Their sleep was but remembered pain, 
And all their hunger but to be 
Poor pilgrims in oblivion's train. 

The stems each had a little shadow 

In the early afternoon, 

When the toilers first were lured 

By a music long immured 

In the central forest ways 

Where no human footfall strays, 

To the dreaming dance of June. 

One by one they woke, their faces 
Still with some new wonder, 
As when in quiet shadowy places 
Wandering hands may move asunder 
Secret foliage, and intrude 
On the ancestral solitude 
Of some untutored forest thing 
Neither doubt nor fear they bring, 
But just a strange new wonder. 



John TDrinkwater 

So now the toilers woke. No thought 

Of the old-time trouble came 

Over them ; the cares deep-wrought, 

Furrowing, by years of shame, 

Lightened, as upon their ears 

Fell a music very low, 

Sweet with moving of the years, 

Burdened with the beat and flow 

Of a garnered ecstasy 

Gathered from the deeps of pain, 

Music vaster than the sea, 

Softer than the rain. 



Then they rose, the music played 
But a little way ahead. 
And with never question made 
They were well to follow. Red 
And gold and opal flashed the noon 
On lichened trunk. Their raiment mean 
Grew heavy in the dance of June, 
And man and maid among the green 
Unburdened them, and stood revealed 
In clean unblushing loveliness, 
Clear glowing limbs, all supple, steeled 
And shining ; many a streaming tress 
Slipped beautiful to breast and knee, 
They proved a world where was no sin, 
Exultant, pure in passion, free, 
Young captives bidden to begin 
New being. Sweet the music called, 
Promising immortal boon, 
Swift they set their feet, enthralled, 
To the dreaming dance of June. 
32 



TDrinkwater 

They passed into the forest's heart, 

Where the shadows thickened, 

Soul and trembling body thrilled 

With a joy new-quickened. 

It was as though from early days 

Their familiars 

Had been the words of worship of the lonely woodland 

ways, 
And the articulate voices of the stars. 

Keeping perfecl measure 
To the music's chime, 
Reaping all the treasure 
Of the summer time, 
Noiselessly along the glades, 
Lithe white limbs all glancing, 
Comely men and comely maids 
Drifted in their dancing. 

When chestnut cones were in the lanes, 
Blushing, and eyed with ebony, 
And young oak-apples lovingly 
Clung to their stems with rosy veins 
Threading their glossy amber then 
They took them to faring, maids and men, 
Whose eyes were dull with toiling, far 
From their toil in the time of a perfecl: noon, 
To where the quiet shadows are, 
And joined the dreaming dance of June.

OLD MAN 

OLD Man, or Lad's-love, in the name there's 
nothing 

To one that knows not Lad's-love, or Old Man, 
The hoar-green feathery herb, almost a tree, 
Growing with rosemary and lavender. 
Even to one that knows it well, the names 
Half decorate, half perplex, the thing it is : 
At least, what that is clings not to the names 
In spite of time. And yet I like the names. 

The herb itself I like not, but for certain 

I love it, as some day the child will love it 

Who plucks a feather from the door-side bush 

Whenever she goes in or out of the house. 

Often she waits there, snipping the tips and shrivelling 

The shreds at last on to the path, perhaps 

Thinking, perhaps of nothing, till she sniffs 

Her fingers and runs off. The bush is still 

But half as tall as she, though it is as old; 

So well she clips it. Not a word she says ; 

And I can only wonder how much hereafter 

She will remember, with that bitter scent, 

Of garden rows, and ancient damson-trees 

Topping a hedge, a bent path to a door, 

A low thick bush beside the door, and me 

Forbidding her to pick. 

As for myself, 
Where first I met the bitter scent is lost. 

37 



Bdward Sastaway 

I, too, often shrivel the grey shreds, 

Sniff them and think and sniff again and try 

Once more to think what it is I am remembering, 

Always in vain. I cannot like the scent, 

Yet I would rather give up others more sweet, 

With no meaning, than this bitter one. 

I have mislaid the key. I sniff the spray 
And think of nothing ; I see and I hear nothing ; 
Yet seem, too, to be listening, lying in wait 
For what I should, yet never can, remember : 
No garden appears, no path, no hoar-green bush 
Of Lad's-love, or Old Man, no child beside, 
Neither father nor mother, nor any playmate ; 
Only an avenue, dark, nameless, without end. 



Bdward Sastaway 



SNOW 

IN the gloom of whiteness, 
In the great silence of snow, 
A child was sighing 
And bitterly saying : " Oh, 

They have killed a white bird up there on her nest, 
The down is fluttering from her breast." 
And still it fell through that dusky brightness 
On the child crying for the bird of the snow.

THE CUCKOO 

THAT 'S the cuckoo, you say. I cannot hear it. 
When last I heard it I cannot recall ; but I know 
Too well the year when first I failed to hear it 
It was drowned by my man groaning out to his sheep 
"Ho! Ho!" 

Ten times with an angry voice he shouted 
" Ho! Ho! " but not in anger, for that was his way. 
He died that Summer, and that is how I remember 
The cuckoo calling, the children listening, and me say 
ing, "Nay." 

And now, as you said, "There it is" I was hearing 
Not the cuckoo at all, but my man's " Ho ! Ho ! " instead. 
And I think that even if I could lose my deafness 
The cuckoo's note would be drowned by the voice of my 
dead.

THE NEW HOUSE 

NOW first, as I shut the door, 
I was alone 

In the new house ; and the wind 
Began to moan. 

Old at once was the house, 

And I was old ; 
My ears were teased with the dread 

Of what was foretold, 

Nights of storm, days of mist, without end ; 

Sad days when the sun 
Shone in vain : old griefs, and griefs 

Not yet begun. 

All was foretold me ; naught 

Could I foresee; 
But I learnt how the wind would sound 

After these things should be.

WIND AND MIST 

THEY met inside the gateway that gives the view, 
A hollow land as vast as heaven. " It is 
A pleasant day, sir." " A very pleasant day." 
" And what a view here. If you like angled fields 
Of grass and grain bounded by oak and thorn, 
Here is a league. Had we with Germany 
To play upon this board it could not be 
More dear than April has made it with a smile. 
The fields beyond that league close in together 
And merge, even as our days into the past, 
Into one wood that has a shining pane 
Of water. Then the hills of the horizon 
That is how I should make hills had I to show 
One who would never see them what hills were like." 
" Yes. Sixty miles of South Downs at one glance. 
Sometimes a man feels proud at them, as if 
He had just created them with one mighty thought." 
" That house, though modern, could not be better 

planned 

For its position. I never liked a new 
House better. Could you tell me who lives in it ? " 
" No one." " Ah and I was peopling all 
Those windows on the south with happy eyes, 
The terrace under them with happy feet; 
Girls " " Sir, I know. I know. I have seen that

And airier. 1 have thought: c 'Twere happy there 
To live/ And I have laughed at that 
Because I lived there then." "Extraordinary." 
" Yes, with my furniture and family 
Still in it, I, knowing every nook of it 
And loving none, and in fact hating it." 
" Dear me ! How could that be ? But pardon me." 
" No offence. Doubtless the house was not to blame, 
But the eye watching from those windows saw, 
Many a day, day after day, mist mist 
Like chaos surging back and felt itself 
Alone in all the world, marooned alone. 
We lived in clouds, on a cliff's edge almost 
(You see), and if clouds went, the visible earth 
Lay too far off beneath and like a cloud. 
I did not know it was the earth I loved 
Until I tried to live there in the clouds 
And the earth turned to cloud." " You had a garden 
Of flint and clay, too." "True; that was real enough. 
The flint was the one crop that never failed. 
The clay first broke my heart, and then my back ; 
And the back heals not. There were other things 
Real, too. In that room at the gable a child 
Was born while the wind chilled a summer dawn : 
Never looked grey mind on a greyer one 
Than when the child's cry broke above the groans." 
" I hope they were both spared." " They were. Oh yes. 
But flint and clay and childbirth were too real 
For this cloud castle. I had forgot the wind. 
Pray do not let me get on to the wind. 
You would not understand about the wind. 
It is my subject, and compared with me 
Those who have always lived on the firm ground 
Are quite unreal in this matter of the wind. 

43 



Edward Sastaway 

There were whole days and nights when the wind and I 

Between us shared the world, and the wind ruled 

And I obeyed it and forgot the mist. 

My past and the past of the world were in the wind. 

Now you will say that though you understand 

And feel for me, and so on, you yourself 

Would find it different. You are all like that 

If once you stand here free from wind and mist: 

I might as well be talking to wind and mist. 

You would believe the house-agent's young man 

Who gives no heed to anything I say. 

Good morning. But one word. I want to admit 

That I would try the house once more, if I could ; 

As I should like to try being young again."

THE UNKNOWN 

SHE is most fair, 
And when they see her pass 
The poets' ladies 
Look na more in the glass 
But after her. 

On a bleak moor 
Running under the moon 
She lures a poet, 
Once proud or happy, soon 
Far from his door. 

Beside a train, 
Because they saw her go, 
Or failed to see her, 
Travellers and watchers know 
Another pain. 

The simple lack 
Of her is more to me 
Than others 7 presence, 
Whether life splendid be 
Or utter black. 

I have not seen, 

I have no news of her ; 

I can tell only 

She is not here, but there 

She might have been. 

45 



Sdward S as t away 

She is to be kissed 
Only perhaps by me ; 
She may be seeking 
Me and no other : she 
May not exist.

THE WORD 

THERE are so many things I have forgot, 
That once were much to me, or that were not, 
All lost, as is a childless woman's child 
And its child's children, in the undefiled 
Abyss of what can never be again. 
I have forgot, too, names of the mighty men 
That fought and lost or won in the old wars, 
Of kings and fiends and gods, and most of the stars. 
Some things I have forgot that I forget. 
But lesser things there are, remembered yet, 
Than all the others. One name that I have not 
Though 'tis an empty thingless name forgot 
Never can die because Spring after Spring 
Some thrushes learn to say it as they sing. 
There is always one at midday saying it clear 
And tart the name, only the name 1 hear. 
While perhaps I am thinking of the elder scent 
That is like food, or while I am content 
With the wild rose scent that is like memory, 
This name suddenly is cried out to me 
From somewhere in the bushes by a bird 
Over and over again, a pure thrush word.

AFTER RAIN 

THE rain of a night and a day and a night 
Stops at the light 

Of this pale choked day. The peering sun 
Sees what has been done. 
The road under the trees has a border new 
Of purple hue 

Inside the border of bright thin grass : 
For all that has 

Been left by November of leaves is torn 
From hazel and thorn 

And the greater trees. Throughout the copse 
No dead leaf drops 

On grey grass, green moss, burnt-orange fern. 
At the wind's return : 
The leaflets out of the ash-tree shed 
Are thinly spread 

In the road, like little black fish, inlaid, 
As if they played. 

What hangs from the myriad branches down there 
So hard and bare 

Is twelve yellow apples lovely to see 
On one crab-tree, 

And on each twig of every tree in the dell 
Uncountable 

Crystals both dark and bright of the rain 
That begins again. 



Sdward Sastaway 



ASPENS 

ALL day and night, save winter, every weather, 
Above the inn, the smithy, and the shop, 
The aspens at the cross-roads talk together 
Of rain, until their last leaves fall from the top. 

Out of the blacksmith's cavern comes the ringing 
Of hammer, shoe, and anvil ; out of the inn 
The clink, the hum, the roar, the random singing 
The sounds that for these fifty years have been. 

The whisper of the aspens is not drowned, 
And over lightless pane and footless road, 
Empty as sky, with every other sound 
Not ceasing, calls their ghosts from their abode, 

A silent smithy, a silent inn, nor fails 

In the bare moonlight or the thick-furred gloom, 

In tempest or the night of nightingales, 

To turn the cross-roads to a ghostly room. 

And it would be the same were no house near. 
Over all sorts of weather, men, and times, 
Aspens must shake their leaves and men may hear 
But need not listen, more than to my rhymes. 

Whatever wind blows, while they and I have leaves 
We cannot other than an aspen be 
That ceaselessly, unreasonably grieves, 
Or so men think who like a different tree.

A PRIVATE 

THIS ploughman dead in battle slept out of doors 
Many a frosty night, and merrily 
Answered staid drinkers, good bedmen, and all bores : 
" At Mrs. Greenland's Hawthorn Bush," said he, 
" I slept." None knew which bush. Above the town, 
Beyond " The Drover," a hundred spot the down 
In Wiltshire. And where now at last he sleeps 
More sound in France that, too, he secret keeps.

SEDGE WARBLERS 

THIS beauty made me dream there was a time 
Long past and irrecoverable, a clime 
Where any brook so radiant racing clear 
Through buttercup and kingcup bright as brass 
But gentle, nourishing the meadow grass 
That leans and scurries in the wind, would bear 
Another beauty, divine and feminine, 
Child to the sun, a nymph whose soul unstained 
Could love all day, and never hate or tire, 
A lover of mortal or immortal kin. 

And yet, rid of this dream, ere I had drained 

Its poison, quieted was my desire 

So that I only looked into the water, 

Clearer than any goddess or man's daughter, 

And hearkened while it combed the dark green hair 

And shook the millions of the blossoms white 

Of water-crowfoot, and curdled to one sheet 

The flowers fallen from the chestnuts in the park 

Far off. And sedge-warblers, clinging so light 

To willow twigs, sang longer than the lark, 

Quick, shrill, or grating, a song to match the heat 

Of the strong sun, nor less the water's cool, 

Gushing through narrows, swirling in the pool. 

Their song that lacks all words, all melody, 

All sweetness almost, was dearer then to me 

Than sweetest voice that sings in tune sweet words. 

This was the best of May the small brown birds 

Wisely reiterating endlessly 

What no man learnt yet, in or out of school.

FOR THESE 

AN acre of land between the shore and the hills, 
Upon a ledge that shows my kingdoms three, 
The lovely visible earth and sky and sea, 
Where what the curlew needs not, the farmer tills: 

A house that shall love me as I love it, 
Well-hedged, and honoured by a few ash-trees 
That linnets, greenfinches, and goldfinches 
Shall often visit and make love in and flit : 

A garden I need never go beyond, 
Broken but neat, whose sunflowers every one 
Are fit to be the sign of the Rising Sun : 
A spring, a brook's bend, or at least a pond : 

For these I ask not, but, neither too late 
Nor yet too early, for what men call content, 
And also that something may be sent 
To be contented with, I ask of fate. 



Bdward Bastaway 



ROADS 

I LOVE roads: 
The goddesses that dwell 
Far along invisible 
Are my favourite gods. 

Roads go on 
While we forget, and are 
Forgotten like a star 
That shoots and is gone. 

On this earth 'tis sure 
We men have not made 
Anything that doth fade 
So soon, so long endure : 

The hill road wet with rain 
In the sun would not gleam 
Like a winding stream 
If we trod it not again. 

They are lonely 
While we sleep, lonelier 
For lack of the traveller 
Who is now a dream only. 

From dawn's twilight 
And all the clouds like sheep 
On the mountains of sleep 
They wind into the night. 

53 



Edward Sastaway 

The next turn may reveal 
Heaven : upon the crest 
The close pine clump, at rest 
And black, may Hell conceal. 

Often footsore, never 
Yet of the road I weary, 
Though long and steep and dreary 
As it winds on for ever. 

Helen of the roads, 
The mountain ways of Wales 
And the Mabinogion tales, 
Is one of the true gods, 

Abiding in the trees, 
The threes and fours so wise, 
The larger companies, 
That by the roadside be, 

And beneath the rafter 
Else uninhabited 
Excepting by the dead; 
And it is her laughter 

At morn and night I hear 
When the thrush cock sings 
Bright irrelevant things, 
And when the chanticleer 

Calls back to their own night 
Troops that make loneliness 
With their light footsteps' press, 
As Helen's own are light. 
54 



Bdward Sastaway 

Now all roads lead to France 
And heavy is the tread 
Of the living ; but the dead 
Returning lightly dance : 

Whatever the road bring 
To me or take from me, 
They keep me company 
With their pattering. 

Crowding the solitude 
Of the loops over the downs, 
Hushing the roar of towns 
And their brief multitude. 



55 



Sdward Sastaway 



THE SOURCE 

ALL day the air triumphs with its two voices 
Of wind and rain : 
As loud as if in anger it rejoices. 
Drowning the sound of earth 
That gulps and gulps in choked endeavour vain 
To swallow the rain. 

Half the night, too, only the wild air speaks 

With wind and rain, 

Till forth the dumb source of the river breaks 

And drowns the rain and wind, 

Bellows like a giant bathing in mighty mirth 

The triumph of earth. 



Edward Sastaway 



LOVERS 

THE two men in the road were taken aback. 
The lovers came out shading their eyes from the 

sun, 

And never was white so white, or black so black, 
As her cheeks and hair. " There are more things than 

one 

A man might turn into a wood for, Jack," 
Said George ; Jack whispered : " He has not got a gun. 
It 's a bit too much of a good thing, I say. 
They are going the other road, look. And see her 

run." 
She ran" What a thing it is, this picking may,"

BEAUTY 

WHAT does it mean ? Tired, angry, and ill at ease, 
No man, woman, or child alive could please 
Me now. And yet I almost dare to laugh 
Because I sit and frame an epitaph 
" Here lies all that no one loved of him 
And that loved no one." Then in a trice that whim 
Has wearied. But, though I am like a river 
At fall of evening while it seems that never 
Has the sun lighted it or warmed it, while 
Cross breezes cut the surface to a file, 
This heart, some fraction of me, happily 
Floats through the window even now to a tree 
Down in the misting, dim-lit, quiet vale, 
Not like a pewit that returns to wail 
For something it has lost, but like a dove 
That slants unswerving to its home and love. 
There I find my rest, and through the dusk air 
Flies what yet lives in me. Beauty is there.

THE BROOK 

SEATED once by a brook, watching a child 
Chiefly that paddled, I was thus beguiled. 
Mellow the blackbird sang and sharp the thrush 
Not far off in the oak and hazel brush, 
Unseen. There was a scent like honeycomb 
From mugwort dull. And down upon the dome 
Of the stone the cart-horse kicks against so oft 
A butterfly alighted. From aloft 
He took the heat of the sun, and from below. 
On the hot stone he perched contented so, 
As if never a cart would pass again 
That way ; as if I were the last of men 
And he the first of insects to have earth 
And sun together and to know their worth. 
I was divided between him and the gleam, 
The motion, and the voices, of the stream, 
The waters running frizzled over gravel, 
That never vanish and for ever travel. 
A grey flycatcher silent on a fence 
And I sat as if we had been there since 
The horseman and the horse lying beneath 
The fir-tree-covered barrow on the heath, 
The horseman and the horse with silver shoes, 
Galloped the downs last. All that I could lose 
I lost. And then the child's voice raised the dead, 
" No one 's been here before " was what she said 
And what I felt, yet never should have found 
A word for, while I gathered sight and sound.

SONG 

AT poet's tears, 
Sweeter than any smiles but hers, 
She laughs ; I sigh ; 
And yet I could not live if she should die. 

And when in June 

Once more the cuckoo spoils his tune, 

She laughs at sighs ; 

And yet she says she loves me till she dies.

CHRISTMAS TREES 

(A CHRISTMAS CIRCULAR LETTER) 

THE city had withdrawn into itself 
And left at last the country to the country ; 
When between whirls of snow not come to lie 
And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove 
A stranger to our yard, who looked the city, 
Yet did in country fashion in that there 
He sat and waited till he drew us out 
A-buttoning coats to ask him who he was. 
He proved to be the city come again 
To look for something it had left behind 
And could not do without and keep its Christmas. 
He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees. 
My woods the young fir-balsams like a place 
Where houses all are churches and have spires. 
I hadn't thought of them as Christmas trees. 
I doubt if I was tempted for a moment 
To sell them off their feet to go in cars 
And leave the slope behind the house all bare, 
Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon. 
I'd hate to have them know it if I was. 
Yet more I'd hate to hold my trees except 
As others hold theirs or refuse for them, 
Beyond the time of profitable growth, 
The trial by market everything must come to. 
I dallied so much with the thought of selling. 
Then, whether from mistaken courtesy 

63 



"Robert Frost 

And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether 
From hope of hearing good of what was mine, 
I said, " There aren't enough to be worth while." 

" I could soon tell how many they would cut, 
You let me look them over." 

" You could look. 
But don't expect Fm going to let you have them." 

Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close 

That lop each other of boughs, but not a few 

Quite solitary and having equal boughs 

All round and round. The latter he nodded " Yes " to, 

Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one 

With buyer's moderation, " That would do." 

I thought so too, but wasn't there to say so. 

We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over, 
And came down on the north. 

He said, " A thousand." 

" A thousand Christmas trees ! at what a-piece ? " 

He felt some need of softening that to me : 

" A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars." 

Then I was certain I had never meant 
To let him have them. Never show surprise ! 
But thirty dollars seemed so small beside 
The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents 
(For that was all they figured out a-piece) 
Three cents so small beside the dollar friends 
I should be writing to within the hour 
Would pay in cities for good trees like those, 

64 



T^obert Frost 

Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools 
Could hang enough on to pick off enough. 

A thousand Christmas trees I didn't know I had! 

Worth three cents more to give away than sell, 

As may be shown by a simple calculation. 

Too bad I couldn't lay one in a letter. 

I can't help wishing 1 could send you one, 

In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.

A GIRL'S GARDEN 

A NEIGHBOR of mine in the village 
Likes to tell how one spring 
When she was a girl on the farm, she did 
A childlike thing. 

One day she asked her father 
To give her a garden plot 
To plant and tend and reap herself 
And he said, "Why not?" 

In casting about for a corner 

He thought of an idle bit 

Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood 

And he said, "Just it !" 

And he said, " That ought to make you 
An eyedeal one-girl farm, 
And give you a chance to put some strength 
On your slim-jim arm." 

It was not enough of a garden, 
Her father said, to plow. 
So she had to work it all by hand, 
But who cares now ? 

She wheeled the dung in a wheelbarrow 
Along a stretch of road, 
(But she always ran away and left 
Her not-nice load 

66 



l^obert Frost 

At the sound of anyone coming.) 
And then she begged the seed. 
She says she thinks she planted one 
Of all things but weed : 

A hill each of potatoes, 

Radishes, lettuce, peas, 

Tomatoes, pumpkins, beets, beans, corn, 

And even fruit trees. 

And yes, she has long mistrusted 
That a cider apple tree 
In bearing there to-day is hers, 
Or at least may be. 

Her crop was a miscellany 
When all was said and done, 
A little bit of everything, 
A great deal of none. 

Now when she sees in the village 
How village things go, 
Just when it seems to come in right 
She says, " / know 

" It 's as when I was a farmer 
Never by way of advice ! 
And she never sins by telling the tale 
To the same person twice.

THE LINE GANG 

HERE come the line gang pioneering by. 
They throw a forest down less cut than broken. 
They plant dead trees for living, and the dead 
They string together with a living thread. 
They string an instrument against the sky 
Wherein words, whether beaten out or spoken 
Will run as hushed as when they were a thought. 
But in no hush they string it : they go past 
With shouts afar to pull the cable taut, 
To hold it hard until they make it fast, 
To ease away they have it. With a laugh 
An oath of towns that set the wild at naught, 
They bring the telephone and telegraph.

PEA BRUSH 

I WALKED down alone Sunday after church 
To the place where John has been cutting trees 
To see for myself about the birch 
He said I could have to tush my peas. 

The sun in the new cut narrow gap 
Was hot enough for the first of May, 
And stifling hot with the odor of sap 
From stumps still bleeding the life away. 

The frogs that were peeping a thousand shrill 
Wherever the ground was low and wet. 
The minute they heard my step went still 
To watch me and see what I came to get. 

Birch boughs enough piled everywhere! 
All fresh and sound from the recent ax. 
Time someone came with a cart and pair 
And got them off the wild flowers' backs. 

They might be good for garden things 
To curl a little finger round, 
The same as you seize cats-cradle strings, 
And lift themselves up off the ground. 

Small good to anything growing wild, 

They were crooking many a trillium 

That had budded before the boughs were piled, 

And since it was coming up, had to come.

THE OVEN BIRD 

THERE is a singer everyone has heard, 
Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird, 
Who makes the solid tree-trunks sound again. 
He says that leaves are old and that for flowers 
Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten. 
He says the early petal-fall is past 
When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers 
On sunny days a moment over-cast ; 
And comes that other fall we name the fal 
He says the highway dust is over all. 
The bird would cease and be as other birds 
But that he knows in singing not to sing. 
The question that he frames in all but words 
Is what to make of a diminished thing.

HYLA BROOK 

BY June our brook 's run out of song and speed. 
Sought for much after that it will be found 
Either to have gone groping under ground 
(And taken with it all the Hyla breed 
That shouted in the mist a month ago 
Like ghost of sleigh bells in the ghost of snow) I 
Or flourished and come up in jewel- weed, 
Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent 
Even against the way its waters went. 
Its bed is left a faded paper sheet 
Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat 
A brook to none but who remember long. 
This as it will be seen is other far 
Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song. 
We love the things we love for what they are.

DAFFODILS 

HE liked the daffodils. He liked to see 
Them nodding in the hedgerows cheerily 
Along the dusty lanes as he went by 
Nodding and laughing to a fellow Ay, 
Nodding and laughing till you'ld almost think 
They, too, enjoyed the jest. 

Without a wink 

That solemn butler said it, calm and smug, 
Deep- voiced as though he talked into a jug: 
" His lordship says he won't require no more 
Crocks rivetted or mended till the war 
Is over." 

Lord ! He'd asked to have a wire 
The moment that his lordship should desire 
To celebrate the occasion fittingly 
By a wild burst of mending crockery 
Like a true Englishman, and hang expense! 
He'd had to ask it, though he'd too much sense 
To lift a lash or breathe a word before 
His lordship's lordship closed the heavy door. 
And then he'd laughed. Lord ! but it did him good, 
That quiet laugh. And somewhere in the wood 
Behind the Hall there, a woodpecker laughed 
Right out aloud as though he'd gone clean daft 
Right out aloud he laughed, the brazen bird, 
As if he didn't care a straw who heard 

75 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

But then he'd not his daily bread to earn 
By mending crocks. 

And now at every turn 
The daffodils were laughing quietly. 
Nodding and laughing to themselves, as he 
Chuckled : Now there 's a patriot, real true-blue I 

It seemed the daffodils enjoyed it too 
The fun of it. He wished that he could see 
Old solemn-mug them laughing quietly 
At him. But then, he'ld never have a dim 
Idea they laughed, and, least of all, at him. 
He'ld never dream they could be laughing at 
A butler. 

'Twould be good to see the fat 
Old peach-cheek in his solemn black and starch 
Parading in his pompous parlour-march 
Across that field of laughing daffodils. 
'Twould be a sight to make you skip up hills, 
Ay, crutch and all, and never feel your pack, 
To see a butler in his starch and black 
Among the daffodils, ridiculous 
As that old bubbly-jock with strut and fuss 
Though that was rather rough upon the bird ! 
For all his pride, he didn't look absurd 
Among the flowers nor even that black sow 
Grunting and grubbing in among them now. 

And he was glad he hadn't got a trade 
That starched the mother-wit in you, and made 
A man look silly in a field of flowers. 
'Twas better mending crocks, although for hours 
You hobbled on ay ! and, maybe for days 
Hungry and cold along the muddy ways 

76 



Wilfrid Wilson (jibs on 

Without a job. And even when the sun 

Was shining, 'twas not altogether fun 

To lose the chance of earning a few pence 

In these days : though 'twas well he'd got the sense 

To see the funny side of things. It cost 

You nothing, laughing to yourself. You lost 

Far more by going fiddle-faced through life 

Looking for trouble. 

He would tell his wife 

When he got home. But lord, she'ld never see 
What tickled him so mightily, not she! 
She'ld only look up puzzled-like, and say 
She didn't wonder at his lordship. Nay, 
With tripe and trotters at the price they were 
You'd got to count your coppers and take care 
Of every farthing. 

Jack would see the fun 

Ay, Jack would see the joke. Jack was his son 
The youngest of the lot. And, man-alive, 
'Twas queer that only one of all the five 
Had got a twinkle in him all the rest 
Dull as ditchwater to the merriest jest. 
Good lads enough they were, their mother's sons ; 
And they'd all pluck enough to face the guns 
Out at the front. They'd got their mother's pluck : 
And he was proud of them, and wished them luck. 

That was no laughing matter though 'twas well, 
Maybe, if you could crack a joke in hell, 
And shame the devil. Jack, at least, would fight 
As well as any though his heart was light. 
Jack was the boy for fighting and for fun; 
And he was glad to think he'd got a son 

77 



W^ilfrid Wilson Qibson 

Who, even facing bloody death, would see 
That little joke about the crockery, 
And chuckle, as he charged. 

His thoughts dropped back 

Through eighteen years ; and he again saw Jack 
At the old home beneath the Malvern hills, 
A little fellow plucking daffodils, 
A little fellow who could scarcely walk, 
Yet chuckling as he snapped each juicy stalk 
And held up every yellow bloom to smell, 
Poking his tiny nose into the bell 
And sniffing its fresh scent, and chuckling still 
As though he'd secrets with each daffodil. 
Ay, he could see again the little fellow 
In his blue frock among that laughing yellow, 
And plovers in their sheeny black and white 
Flirting and tumbling in the morning light 
About his curly head. He still could see, 
Shutting his eyes, as plain as plain could be, 
Drift upon drift, those long-dead daffodils 
Against the far green of the Malvern hills, 
Nodding and laughing round his little lad, 
As if to see him happy made them glad 
Nodding and laughing . . . 

They were nodding now, 
The daffodils, and laughing yet, somehow, 
They didn't seem so merry now . . . 

And he 

Was fighting in a bloody trench maybe 
For very life this minute . . . 

They missed Jack, 
And he would give them all to have him back. 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 



THE PLOUGH 

HE sniffed the clean and eager smell 
Of crushed wild garlic, as he thrust 
Beneath the sallows : and a spell 
He stood there munching a thick crust 
The fresh tang giving keener zest 
To bread and cheese and watched a pair 
Of wagtails preening wing and breast, 
Then running flirting tails in air, 
And pied plumes sleeked to silky sheen 
Chasing each other in and out 
The wet wild garlic's white and green. 

And then remembering, with a shout, 
And rattle whirring, he ran back 
Again into the Fair Maid's Mead, 
To scare the rascal thieves and black 
That flocked from far and near to feed 
Upon the sprouting grain. As one 
They rose with clapping rustling wings 
Rooks, starlings, pigeons, in the sun 
Circling about him in wide rings, 
And plovers hovering over him 
In mazy, interweaving flight 
Until it made his young wits swim 
To see them up against the light, 
A dazzling maze of black and white 
Against the clear blue April sky 
Wings on wings in flashing flight 
Swooping low and soaring high 

79 



Wilfrid Wilson (jibson 

Swooping, soaring, fluttering, flapping, 

Tossing, tumbling, swerving, dipping, 

Chattering, cawing, creaking, clapping, 

Till he felt his senses slipping 

And gripped his corncrake rattle tight, 

And flourished it above his head 

Till every bird was out of sight : 

And laughed, when all had flown and fled, 

To think that he, and all alone, 

Could put so many thieves to rout. 

Then sitting down upon a stone 
He wondered if the school were out 
The school where, only yesterday, 
He'd sat at work among his mates 
At work that now seemed children's play, 
With pens and pencils, books and slates 
Although he'd liked it well enough, 
The hum and scuffling of the school, 
And hadn't cared when Grim-and-GrufF 
Would call him dunderhead and fool. 

And he could see them sitting there 
His class-mates, in the lime-washed room, 
With fingers inked and towzled hair 
Bill Baxter with red cheeks abloom, 
And bright black eyes ; and Ginger Jim 
With freckled face and solemn look, 
Who'ld wink a pale blue eye at him, 
Then sit intent upon his book, 
While, caught a-giggle, he was caned. 

He'd liked that room, he'd liked it all 
The window steaming when it rained ; 
80 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

The sunlight dancing on the wall 

Among the glossy charts and maps ; 

The blotchy stain beside the clock 

That only he of all the chaps 

Knew for a chart of Dead Man's Rock 

That lies in Tiger Island Bay 

The reef on which the schooners split 

And founder, that would bear away 

The treasure-chest of Cut- throat-Kit, 

That 's buried under Black BilFs bones 

Beneath the purple pepper-tree . . . 

A trail of clean-sucked cherry-stones, 

Which you must follow carefully, 

Across the dunes of yellow sand 

Leads winding upward from the beach 

Till, with a pistol in each hand, 

And cutlass 'twixt your teeth, you reach . . . 

Plumping their fat crops peacefully 
Were plovers, pigeons, starlings, rooks, 
Feeding on every side while he 
Was in the land of story-books. 
He raised his rattle with a shout 
And scattered them with yell and crake . . . 
A man must mind what he 's about 
And keep his silly wits awake, 
Not go wool-gathering, if he'ld earn 
His wage. And soon, no schoolboy now, 
He'ld take on a man's job, and learn 
To build a rick, and drive the plough, 
Like father . . . 

Up against the sky 
Beyond the spinney and the stream, 
With easy stride and steady eye 

81 G 



Wilfrid Wilson Cjibson 

He saw his father drive his team, 
Turning the red marl gleaming wet 
Into long furrows clean and true. 
And dreaming there, he longed to set 
His young hand to the ploughshare too.

THE DROVE-ROAD 

F^WAS going to snow 'twas snowing! Curse his 
1 luck! 

And fifteen mile to travel here was he 
With nothing but an empty pipe to suck. 
And half a flask of rum but that would be 
More welcome later on. He'd had a drink 
Before he left ; and that would keep him warm 
A tidy while : and 'twould be good to think 
He'd something to fall back on, if the storm 
Should come to much. You never knew with snow. 
A sup of rain he didn't mind at all, 
But snow was different with so far to go 
Full fifteen mile, and not a house of call. 
Ay, snow was quite another story, quite 
Snow on these fell-tops with a north-east wind 
Behind it, blowing steadily with a bite 
That made you feel that you were stark and skinned. 

And those poor beasts and they just off the boat 

A day or so, and hardly used to land 

Still dizzy with the sea, their wits afloat. 

When they first reached the dock, they scarce could stand, 

They'd been so joggled. It 's gey bad to cross, 

After a long day's jolting in the train, 

Thon Irish Channel, always pitch and toss 

And heads or tails, not much for them to gain ! 

And then the market, and the throng and noise 

83 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

Of yapping dogs : and they stung mad with fear, 
Welted with switches by those senseless boys 
Held like to dust their jackets! But 'twas queer, 
A beast's life, when you came to think of it 
From start to finish queerer, ay, a lot 
Then any man's, and chancier a good bit. 
With his ash-sapling at their heels they'd got 
To travel before night those fifteen miles 
Of hard fell-road, against the driving snow, 
Half-blinded, on and on. He thought at whiles 
'Twas just as well for them they couldn't know . . 

Though, as for that, 'twas little that he knew 
Himself what was in store for him. He took 
Things as they came. 'Twas all a man could do ; 
And he'd kept going, somehow, by hook or crook. 
And here was he, with fifteen mile of fell, 
And snow, and . . . God, but it was blowing stiff ! 
And no tobacco. Blest if he could tell 
Where he had lost it but, for half a whiff 
He'ld swop the very jacket off his back 
Not that he'ld miss the cobweb of old shreds 
That held the holes together. 

Thon Cheap-Jack 

Who'd sold it him, had said it was Lord Ted's, 
And London cut. But Teddy had grown fat 
Since he'd been made an alderman . . . His bid? 
And did the gentleman not want a hat 
To go with it, a topper? If he did, 
Here was the very . . . 

Hell, but it was cold : 

And driving dark it was nigh dark as night. 
He'ld almost think he must be getting old, 
To feel the wind so. And long out of sight 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

The beasts had trotted. Well, what odds ! The way 
Ran straight for ten miles on, and they'ld go straight. 
They'ld never heed a by-road. Many a day 
He'd had to trudge on, trusting them to fate, 
And always found them safe. They scamper fast, 
But in the end a man could walk them down. 
They're showy trotters ; but they cannot last. 
He'ld race the fastest beast for half-a-crown 
On a day's journey. Beasts were never made 
For steady travelling : drive them twenty mile, 
And they were done ; while he was not afraid 
To tackle twice that distance with a smile. 

But not a day like this ! He'd never felt 

A wind with such an edge. 'Twas like the blade 

Of the rasper in the pocket of his belt 

He kept for easy shaving. In his trade 

You'd oft to make your toilet under a dyke 

And he was always one for a clean chin, 

And carried soap. 

He'd never felt the like 

That wind, it cut clean through him to the skin. 
He might be mother-naked, walking bare, 
For all the use his clothes were, with the snow 
Half-blinding him, and clagging to his hair, 
And trickling down his spine. He'ld like to know 
What was the sense of pegging steadily, 
Chilled to the marrow, after a daft herd 
Of draggled beasts he couldn't even see ! 

But that was him all over! Just a word, 
A nod, a wink, the price of half-and-half 
And he'ld be setting out for God-knows-where, 

85 



Wilfrid Wilson (jibson 

With no more notion than a yearling calf 
Where he would find himself when he got there. 
And he'd been travelling hard on sixty year 
The same old road, the same old giddy gait ; 
And he'ld be walking, for a pint of beer, 
Into his coffin, one day, soon or late 
But not with such a tempest in his teeth, 
Half-blinded and half-dothered, that he hoped ! 
He'd met a sight of weather on the heath, 
But this beat all. 

'Twas worse than when he'd groped 
His way that evening down the Mallerstang 
Thon was a blizzard, thon and he was done, 
And almost dropping when he came a bang 
Against a house slap-bang, and like to stun 
Though that just saved his senses and right there 
He saw a lighted window he'd not seen, 
Although he'd nearly staggered through its glare 
Into a goodwife's kitchen, where she'd been 
Baking hot girdle-cakes upon the peat. 
And he could taste them now, and feel the glow 
Of steady, aching, tingly, drowsy heat, 
As he sat there and let the caking snow 
Melt off his boots, staining the sanded floor. 
And that brown jug she took down from the shelf 
And every time he'd finished, fetching more, 
And piping: "Now reach up, and help yourself! " 
She was a wonder, thon, the gay old wife 
But no such luck this journey. Things like that 
Could hardly happen every day of life, 
Or no one would be dying, but the fat 
And oily undertakers, starved to death 
For want of custom . . . Hell ! but he would soon 
Be giving them a job ... It caught your breath, 

86 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

That throttling wind. And it was not yet noon ; 
And held be travelling through it until dark. 
Dark? 'Twas already dark, and might be night 
For all that he could see ... 

And not a spark 

Of comfort for him ! Just to strike a light, 
And press the kindling shag down in the bowl. 
Keeping the flame well-shielded by his hand, 
And puff, and puff ! He'ld give his very soul 
For half-a-pipe. He couldn't understand 
How he had come to lose it. He'd the rum 
Ay, that was safe enough : but it would keep 
Awhile, you never knew what chance might come 
In such a storm . . . 

If he could only sleep . . . 

If he could only sleep . . . That rustling sound 
Of drifting snow, it made him sleepy-like 
Drowsy and dizzy, dithering round and round . . . 
If he could only curl up under a dyke, 
And sleep and sleep ... It dazzled him, that white, 
Drifting and drifting, round and round and round . 
Just half-a-moment's snooze . . . He'ld be all right. 
It made his head quite dizzy, that dry sound 
Of rustling snow. It made his head go round 
That rustling in his ears . . . and drifting, drifting . 
If he could only sleep ... he would sleep sound . . . 
God, he was nearly gone ! 

The storm was lifting ; 

And he'd run into something soft and warm 
Slap into his own beasts, and never knew. 
Huddled they were, bamboozled by the storm 
And little wonder either, when it blew 
A blasted blizzard. Still, they'd got to go. 
They couldn't stand there snoozing until night. 

8? 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

But they were sniffing something in the snow. 
'Twas that had stopped them, something big and white- 
A bundle nay, a woman . . . and she slept. 
But it was death to sleep. 

He'd nearly dropt 

Asleep himself. Twas well that he had kept 
That rum ; and lucky that the beasts had stopt. 

Ay, it was well that he had kept the rum. 
He liked his drink : but he had never cared 
For soaking by himself, and sitting mum. 
Even the best rum tasted better, shared.

Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 



IN THE MEADOW 

THE smell of wet hay in the heat 
All morning steaming round him rose, 
As, in a kind of nodding doze, 
Perched on the hard and jolting seat, 
He drove the rattling, jangling rake 
Round and around the Five Oaks Mead. 
With that old mare he scarcely need 
To drive at all or keep awake. 
Gazing with half-shut, sleepy eyes 
At her white flanks and grizzled tail 
That flicked and flicked without avail 
To drive away the cloud of flies 
That hovered, closing and unclosing, 
A shimmering hum and humming shimmer, 
Dwindling dim and ever dimmer 
In his dazzled sight, till, dozing, 
He seemed to hear a murmuring stream 
And gaze into a rippling pool 
Beneath thick branches dark and cool 
And gazing, gazing till a gleam 
Within the darkness caught his eyes, 
He saw there smiling up at him 
A young girl's face, now rippling dim, 
Now flashing clear . . . 

Without surprise 

He marked the eyes translucent blue, 
The full red lips that seemed to speak, 
The curves of rounded chin and cheek, 



Wilfrid Wilson (jibson 

The low, broad brow, sun-tanned . . . 

He knew 

That face, yet could not call to mind 
Where he had seen it; and in vain 
Strove to recall . . .when sudden rain 
Crashed down and made the clear pool blind, 
And it was lost . . . 

And, with a jerk 

That well-nigh shook him from his seat, 
He wakened to the steamy heat 
And clank and rattle. 

Still at work 

The stolid mare kept on ; and still 
Over her hot, white flanks the flies 
Hung humming. And his dazzled eyes 
Closed gradually again, until 
He dozed . . . 

And stood within the door 
Of Dinchill dairy, drinking there 
Thirst-quenching draughts of stone-cold air 
The scoured white shelves and sanded floor 
And shallow milk-pans creamy white 
Gleamed coldly in the dusky light . . . 
And then he saw her, stooping down 
Over a milk-pan, while her eyes 
Looked up at him without surprise 
Over the shoulder of her gown 
Her fresh print gown of speedwell blue . . . 
The eyes that looked out of the cool 
Untroubled crystal of the pool 
Looked into his again. 

He knew 
Those eyes now . . . 

From his dreamy doze 
90 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

A sudden jolting of the rake 
Aroused him. 

Startled, broad awake 
He sat upright, lost in amaze 
That he should dream of her that lass ! 
And see her face within the pool! 

He'd known her always. Why, at school 
They'd sat together in the class. 
He'd always liked her well enough, 
Young Polly Dale and they had played 
At Prisoners' Base and Who's Afraid, 
At Tiggy and at Blindman's Buff, 
A hundred times together . . . 

Ay, 

He'd always known her ... It was strange, 
Though he had noticed that a change 
Had come upon her she was shy, 
And quieter, since she left school 
And put her hair up he'd not seen 
Her face, till from the glancing sheen 
It looked up at him from the pool . . . 

He'd always known her. Every day, 
He'd nod to her as they would pass. 
He'd always known her as a lass . . . 
He'ld never know her just that way 
Again now . . . 

In a different wise 

They'ld meet for how could he forget 
His dream . . . The next time that they met 
He'ld look into a woman's eyes. 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 



THE PLATELAYER 

HHAPPING the rails as he went by 

1 And driving the slack wedges tight, 
He walked towards the morning sky 
Between two golden lines of light 
That dwindled slowly into one 
Sheer golden rail that ran right on 
Over the fells into the sun. 

And dazzling in his eyes it shone, 
That golden track, as left and right 
He swung his clinking hammer ay, 
'Twas dazzling after that long night 
In Hindfell tunnel, working by 
A smoky flare, and making good 
The track the rains had torn . . . 

Clink, clink, 

On the sound metal on the wood 
A duller thwack ! 

It made him blink, 
That running gold . . . 

'Twas sixteen hours 
Since he'd left home his garden smelt 
So fragrant with the heavy showers 
When he left home and now he felt 
That it would smell more fresh and sweet 
After the tunnel's reek and fume 
Of damp warm cinders. 'Twas a treat 
To come upon the scent and bloom 
92 



Wilfrid Wilson Cfibson 

That topped the cutting by the wood 
After the cinders of the track. 
The cinders and tarred sleepers good 
To lift your eyes from gritty black 
Upon that blaze of green and red . . . 
And she'ld be waiting by the fence, 
And with the baby . . . 

Straight for bed 

He'ld make, if he had any sense, 
And sleep the day; but, like as not, 
When he'd had breakfast, he'ld turn to 
And hoe the back potato-plot : 
'Twould be one mass of weeds he knew. 
You'ld think each single drop of rain 
Turned, as it fell, into a weed. 
You seemed to hoe and hoe in vain. 
Chickweed and groundsel didn't heed 
The likes of him and bindweed, well, 
You hoed and hoed still its white roots 
Ran deeper . . . 

'Twould be good to smell 
The fresh-turned earth, and feel his boots 
Sink deep into the brown wet mould, 
After hard cinders . . . 

And, maybe, 

The baby, sleeping good as gold 
In its new carriage under a tree, 
Would keep him company, while his wife 
Washed up the breakfast-things. 

'Twas strange, 

The difference that she made to life, 
That tiny baby-girl. 

The change 
Of work would make him sleep more sound. 

93 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

'Twas sleep he needed. That long night 
Shovelling wet cinders underground. 
With breaking back the smoky light 
Stinging his eyes till they were sore . . . 

He'd worked the night that she was born, 
Standing from noon the day before 
All through that winter's night till morn 
Laying fog-signals on the line 
Where it ran over Devil's Ghyll . . . 

And she was born at half-past nine, 
Just as he stood aside until 
The Scots' Express ran safely by ... 
He'd but to shut his eyes to see 
Those windows flashing blindingly 
A moment through the blizzard he 
Could feel again that slashing snow 
That seemed to cut his face. 

But they, 

The passengers, they couldn't know 
What it cost him to keep the way 
Open for them. So snug and warm 
They slept or chattered, while he stood 
And faced all night that raking storm 
The little house beside the wood 
For ever in his thoughts : and he, 
Not knowing what was happening . . . 

But all went well as well could be 
With Sally and the little thing. 
And it had been worth while to wait 
Through that long night with work to do, 
To meet his mother at the gate 
94 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

With such good news, and find it true, 
Ay, truer than the truth. 

He still 

Could see his wife's eyes as he bent 
Over the bairn . . . 

The Devil's Ghyll 

Had done its worst, and he was spent ; 
But he'ld have faced a thousand such 
Wild nights as thon, to see that smile 
Again, and feel that tender touch 
Upon his cheek. 

'Twas well worth while 
With such reward. And it was strange, 
The difference such a little thing 
Could make to them how it could change 
Their whole life for them, and could bring 
Such happiness to them, though they 
Had seemed as happy as could be 
Before it came to them. 

The day 

Was shaping well. And there was she, 
The lassie sleeping quietly 
Within her arms, beside the gate. 

The storm had split that lilac tree. 
But he was tired, and it must wait. 



95 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 



MAKESHIFTS 

AND after all, 'twas snug and weather-tight, 
His garret. That was much on such a night 
To be secure against the wind and sleet 
At his age, and not wandering the street, 
A shuffling, shivering bag-of-bones. 

And yet 

Things would be snugger if he could forget 
The bundle of old dripping rags that slouched 
Before him down the Canongate, that crouched 
Close to the swing-doors of the Spotted Cow. 
Why, he could see that poor old sinner now, 
Ay ! and could draw him, if he'd had the knack 
Of drawing anything a steamy, black 
Dilapidation, basking in the glare, 
And sniffing with his swollen nose in air 
To catch the hot reek when the door swings wide 
And shows the glittering paradise inside, 
Where men drink golden fire on seats of plush 
Lolling like gods : he stands there in the slush 
Shivering, from squelching boots to sopping hat 
One sodden clout, and blinking like a bat 
Be-dazzled by the blaze of light : his beard 
Waggles and drips from lank cheeks pocked and seared ; 
And the whole dismal night about him drips, 
As he stands gaping there with watering lips 
And burning eyes in the cold sleety drench, 
Afire with thirst that only death may quench. 



Wilfrid Wilson Cfibson 

Yet he had clutched the sixpence greedily 

As if sixpennyworth of rum maybe 

Would satisfy that thirst. Who knows ! It might 

Just do the trick perhaps on such a night. 

And death would be a golden, fiery drink 

To that old scarecrow. 'Twould be good to think 

His money'd satisfied that thirst, and brought 

Rest to those restless fevered bones that ought 

Long since to have dropped for ever out of sight. 

It wasn't decent, wandering the night 

Like that not decent. While it lived it made 

A man turn hot to see it, and afraid 

To look it in the face lest he should find 

That bundle was himself, grown old and blind 

With thirst unsatisfied. 

He'd thirsted, too, 

His whole life long, though not for any brew 
That trickled out of taps in gaudy bars 
For those with greasy pence to spend ! 

The stars 

Were not for purchase, neither bought nor sold 
By any man for silver or for gold. 



Still, he was snug and sheltered from the storm. 
He sat by his own hearth secure and warm, 
And that was much indeed on such a night. 
The little room was pleasant with the light 
Glowing on lime-washed walls, kindling to red 
His copper pots, and, over the white bed, 
The old torn Rembrandt print to golden gloom. 
'Twas much on such a night to have a room 
Four walls and ceiling storm-tight overhead. 
Denied the stars well, you must spend instead 

97 



Wilfrid Wilson Cjibson 

Your sixpences on makeshifts. Life was naught 
But toiling for the sixpences that bought 
Makeshifts for stars. 

'Twas snug to hear the sleet 
Lashing the panes and sweeping down the street 
Towards Holyrood and out into the night 
Of hills beyond. Maybe it would be white 
On Arthur's seat to-morrow, white with snow 
A white hill shining in the morning glow 
Beyond the chimney-pots, that was a sight 
For any man to see a snowy height 
Soaring into the sunshine. He was glad, 
Though he must live in slums, his garret had 
A window to the hills. 

And he was warm, 

Ay, warm and snug, shut in here from the storm. 
The sixpences bought comfort for old bones 
That else must crouch all night on paving-stones 
Unsheltered from the cold. 

'Twas hard to learn 

In his young days that this was life to earn 
By life-long labour just your board and bed 
Although the stars were singing overhead, 
The sons of morning singing together for joy 
As they had sung for every bright-eyed boy 
With ears to hear since life itself was young 
And leave so much unseen, so much unsung. 

He'd had to learn that lesson. 'Twas no good 

To go star-gazing for a livelihood 

With empty belly. Though he had a turn 

For seeing things, when you have got to earn 

Your daily bread first, there is little time 

To paint your dream or set the stars to rhyme: 



Wilfrid Wilson Cjibson 

Nay, though you have the vision and the skill 
You cannot draw the outline of a hill 
To please yourself, when you get home half-dead 
After the day's work hammers in your head 
Still tapping, tapping . . . 

Always mad to draw 
The living shape of everything he saw 
He'd had to spend his utmost skill and strength 
Learning a trade to live by, till at length 
Now he'd the leisure the old skill was dead. 



Born for a painter as it seemed, instead 
He'd spent his life upholstering furniture. 
'Twas natural enough men should prefer 
Upholstery to pictures, and their ease 
To little coloured daubs of cows and trees. 
He didn't blame them, 'twas no fault of theirs 
That they saw life in terms of easy chairs, 
And heaven, like that old sinner in the slush, 
A glittering bar upholstered in red plush. 

'Twas strange to look back on it now, his life . . . 

His father, married to a second wife ; 

And home, no home for him since he could mind, 

Save when the starry vision made him blind 

To all about him, and he walked on air 

For days together, and without a care . . . 

But as the years passed, seldomer they came 

Those starry dazzling nights and days aflame, 

And oftener a sudden gloom would drop 

Upon him, drudging all day in the shop 

With his young brother John John always gay 

Taking things as they came, the easy way, 

99 



Wilfrid Wilson 

Not minding overmuch if things went wrong 
At home, and always humming a new song . . . 

And then she came into his life, and shook 

All heaven about him. He had but to look 

On her to find the stars within his reach. 

But, ere his love had trembled into speech, 

He'd waked one day to know that not for him 

Were those bright living eyes that turned dreams dim 

To know that while he'd worshipped, John and she 

Had taken to each other easily . . . 

But that was years ago . . . and now he sat 
Beside a lonely hearth. And they were fat 
Ay, fat and old they were, John and his wife, 
And with a grown-up family. Their life 
Had not been over-easy : they'd their share 
Of trouble, ay, more than enough to spare : 
But they had made the best of things, and taken 
Life as it came with courage still unshaken. 
They'd faced their luck, but never gone half-way 
To meet fresh trouble. Life was always gay 
For them between the showers : the roughest weather 
Might do its worst they always stood together 
To bear the brunt, together stood their ground 
And came through smiling cheerfully. They'd found 
Marriage a hard-up, happy business 
Of hand-to-mouth existence more or less ; 
But taking all in all, well worth their while 
To look on the bright side of things to smile 
When all went well, not fearing overmuch 
When life was suddenly brought to the touch 
And you'd to sink or swim. And they'd kept hold, 

100 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

And even now, though they were fat and old 
They'd still a hearty grip on life . . . 

They'ld be 

Sitting there in their kitchen after tea 
On either side the fire-place even now 
Jane with her spectacles upon her brow, 
And nodding as she knitted, listening 
While John, in shirt-sleeves, scraped his fiddle-string, 
With one ear hearkening lest a foot should stop 
And some rare customer invade the shop 
To ask the price of that old Flanders' chest 
Or oaken ale-house settle . . . 

They'd the best 
Of life, maybe, together . . . 

And yet he 

Though he'd not taken life so easily, 
Had always hated makeshifts more or less, 
Grudging to swop the stars for sixpences, 
And was an old man now, with that old thirst 
Unsatisfied ay, even at the worst 
He'd had his compensations, now and then 
A starry glimpse. You couldn't work with men 
And quite forget the stars. Though life was spent 
In drudgery, it hadn't only meant 
Upholstering chairs in crimson plush for bars . . . 
Maybe it gave new meaning to the stars, 
The drudgery, who knows! 

At least the rare 

Wild glimpses he had caught at whiles were there 
Yet living in his mind. When much was dim 
And drudgery forgotten, bright for him 
Burned even now in memory old delights 
That had been his in other days and nights. 
He'd always seen, though never could express 

101 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

His eyes' delight, or only more or less : 
But things once clearly seen, once and for all 
The soul's possessions naught that may befall 
May ever dim, and neither moth nor rust 
Corrupt the dream, that, shedding mortal dust, 
Has soared to life and spread its wings of gold 
Within the soul . . . 

And yet when they were told, 
These deathless visions, little things they seemed 
Though something of the beauty he had dreamed 
Burned in them, something of his youth's desire . . , 

And as he sat there, gazing at the fire 
Once more he lingered, listening in the gloom 
Of that great silent warehouse, in the room 
Where stores were kept, one hand upon a shelf, 
And heard a lassie singing to herself 
Somewhere unseen without a thought who heard, 
Just singing to herself like any bird 
Because the heart was happy in her breast, 
As happy as the day was long. At rest 
He lingered, listening, and a ray of light 
Streamed from the dormer-window up a height 
Down on the bales of crimson cloth, and lit 
To sudden gold the dust that danced in it, 
Till he was dazzled by the golden motes 
That kept on dancing to those merry notes 
Before his dreaming eyes, and danced as long 
As he stood listening to the lassie's song . . . 

Then once again, his work-bag on his back, 
He climbed that April morning up the track 
That took him by a short cut through the wood 
Up to the hill-top where the great house stood, 

IO2 



Wilfrid Wilson (jibson 

When suddenly beyond the firs' thick night 
He saw a young fawn frisking in the light : 
Shaking the dew-drops in a silver rain 
From off his dappled hide, he leapt again 
As though he'ld jump out of his skin for joy. 
With laughing eyes light-hearted as a boy 
He watched the creature unaware of him 
Quivering with eager life in every limb, 
Leaping and frisking on the dewy green 
Beneath the flourish of the snowy gean, 
While every now and then the long ears pricked 
And budding horns, as he leapt higher, flicked 
The drooping clusters of wild-cherry bloom, 
Shaking the snow about him. From the gloom 
Of those dark wintry firs, his eyes had won 
A sight of April sporting in the sun 
Young April leaping to its heart's delight 
Among the dew beneath the boughs of white . . . 

And there'd been days among the hills, rare days 
And rarer nights among the heathery ways 
Rare golden holidays when he had been 
Alone in the great solitude of green 
Wave-crested hills, a rolling shoreless sea 
Flowing for ever through eternity 
A sea of grasses, streaming without rest 
Beneath the great wind blowing from the west, 
Over which cloud shadows sailed and swept away 
Beyond the world's edge all the summer day. 

The hills had been his refuge, his delight, 
Seen or unseen, through many a day or night. 
His help was of the hills, steadfast, serene 

103 



Wilfrid Wilson Qibson 

In their eternal strength, those shapes of green 
Sublimely moulded. 

Whatsoever his skill. 
No man hath ever rightly drawn a hill 
To his mind never caught the subtle curves 
Of sweeping moorland with its dips and swerves- 
Nor ever painted heather . . . 

Heather came 

Always into his mind like sudden flame, 
Blazing and streaming over stony braes 
As he had seen it on that day of days 
When he had plunged into a sea of bloom, 
Blinded with colour, stifled with the fume 
Of sun-soaked blossom, the hot heady scent 
Of honey-breathing bells, and sunk content 
Into a soft and scented bed to sleep ; 
And he had lain in slumber sweet and deep, 
And only wakened when the full moon's light 
Had turned that wavy sea of heather white : 
And still he'd lain within the full moon blaze 
Hour after hour bewildered and adaze 
As though enchanted in a waking swoon 
He'd lain within the full glare of the moon 
Until she seemed to shine on him alone 
In all the world as though his body'd grown 
Until it covered all the earth, and he 
Was swaying like the moon-enchanted sea 
Beneath that cold white witchery of light ... 
And now, the earth itself, he hung in night 
Turning and turning in that cold white glare 
For ever and for ever . . . . 

She was there 

There at his window now, the moon. The sleet 
And wind no longer swept the quiet street. 

104 



Wilfrid Wilson (jibson 

And he was cold : the fire had burnt quite low : 
And, while he'd dreamt, there'd been a fall of snow. 
He wondered where that poor old man would hide 
His head to-night with thirst unsatisfied . . . 

His thirst who knows ! but night may quench the thirst 
Day leaves unsatisfied . . . 

Well, he must first 

Get to his bed and sleep away the night, 
If he would rise to see the hills still white 
In the first glory of the morning light.

MICAH 

IN Ephraim where skies are chiefly blue, 
Towards massive dome-like peaks the hills wind 

north. 

The house of Micah on this ridge juts forth, 
Some other roofs peep near, and rocks thrust through 
Large leafy trees which shade an uphill road. 
And all who pass wish his their own abode ; 
For hard thereby tufts of maidenhair fern 
Kiss in a trough their green inverted showers, 
And men, whose business presses, will waste hours 
Watching each ripple flood the brim in turn. 
The morning still felt fresh as it began 
When thither came six hundred men of Dan ; 
From Eshtaol hailed some, from Zorah others ; 
And most were fully armed ; for, near their brothers, 
No longer was there place or land to till ; 
So they had sent forth five of might and skill 
To search them out a vale for heritage. 
These spies chose Laish ; warless a long age 
Its folk dwelt careless, as the manner holds 
With the Zidonians, safe as sheep in folds, 
Apart from all men else ; in genial state 
They pleased themselves without a magistrate 
Who might put men to shame for doing wrong. 
Those five now lead forth Dan, six hundred strong. 
And having noted 'gainst the present day 
What by the road most promised profit, they 

109 



T. Sturge ZMoore 

Called a halt here, not for that water's sake, 
Nor to buy milk their children's fast to break : 
They had no honest cause to stop at all. 
Though Micah's house stood back across a court 
His Levite's lattice pierced the outer wall 
And was the sooth- and charm-buyer's resort. 
Talking they stopped ; the priest was bound to hear, 
His ears waked up by Shibboleths, full dear 
Since Bethlehem his home bordered on theirs, 
(Though he had not been near it now for years, 
But, having found a place, he served this man 
Who owned an house of gods). Those five of Dan, 
Though they before had been his master's guests, 
Now, while he questioned of those parts loved most, 
Of all that, where he first was happy, rests, 
Crossed the paved court, but did not hail their host ; 
Like boys who climb to where the wild hawk nests, 
Neared hushed, and mute unto his God's house went. 
His Ephod and the Teraphim which leant 
By either post to guard the door they took; 
Glanced round like boys who for due vengeance look, 
Dogged by dreamed whirr of wings ; bold then did 

seize, 

Molten and graven, both his images. 
This quickly done, they hastened to their friends. 
And meanwhile Micah through his vineyard wends, 
His mind unflecked by thought of guile or hate 
To where his servants dig a goodly vat. 
He means to see the floor well-grooved and flat. 

"What do ye ? " said the Levite at the gate. 
The five made ready answer " Be thou dumb ! 
Lay thou thy hand upon thy mouth and come ! 
Shall we not need a father and a priest ? 

1 10 



T. Sturge ^Moore 

Whether is best for thee to serve one man 

Or a whole tribe ? Is the advantage least 

Thou spiest with us ? " Then in the midst of Dan, 

Charged with the gods and ephod, pleased at once, 

That Levite went. Putting their little ones, 

Women and carts before them, all moved on. 

Of Micah's maids no few watched what was done ; 

Who, when those men were not so nigh to hear, 

Ventured beyond the threshold ; wan with fear 

Ran down among the vines and raised the cry 

As then was wont ; they pitched it shrill and high. 

Listen ! a thing of price 

Is stolen is lost has gone ! 

He who to find it tries 

Shall be well looked upon, 

He who will stop the thieves 

His courage shall be showed ! 

Follow them by the shaking of the leaves 

Follow them by the dust above the road ! 

Gird on the sword Take down the spear ! 

Ye who are not cowards 

Who own good names, who hold them dear 

An evil act is towards ! 

That workers of iniquity may tremble 

Hither assemble ! 

Now Micah heard : and, conscious he was rich, 
Harassed by shrewd surmises that would twitch 
Its leading strings and bring his heart to stand, 
Made toward the sound, soon met a white-faced girl 
Who gaped upon him, till his short command 
Loosed her numb tongue and checked her senses' whirl 
To pour his losses on him ; though more fast 
Her eyes outran her words, which being passed 

in 



7*. Sturge ZMoore 

Told what was known, yet only told it half. 

Though Micah hurry, endless seems the path, 

And countless are the incidents beheld ; 

His brain to trivial notice seems compelled. 

Bronzed heads enquiring thrust out through green 

leaves 

The cloak which, to be going, some one heaves 
About his shoulders, while he scowls to hear ; 
A spade struck deep in earth stands upright near; 
Scared women's mantles flapping down the lanes ; 
The brisk commotion, as when summer rains 
Set the farms bustling lest things hung to dry 
Again be wetted, so upon that cry 
He saw men cross the open here and there, 
Not to take shelter. Matrons grave with care 
Haste out of doors, not for white sheets distraught ; 
Lads keep pace with their elders, deep in thought; 
A first time summoned at the public need 
They pay example very anxious heed. 
Grave for a sparkling cruelty returning, 
Rapt students, they lack ears for questions wrung 
From girls on whose words they had often hung 
Whose hearts now first are for an answer yearning, 
Left thus among the children dazed with tears, 
While baleful 'mid the leaves flash gathering spears. 
At last was Micah thronged about with friends : 
There in his own paved court all counsel bends 
Unanimous in concert with his own, 
As though four hundred limbs, not his alone 
Answered his instincts, prompt, imperative, 
For hot pursuit. One whom a host moves with, 
The road glides past beneath him like a dream ; 
At length before his eyes in harness gleam 
Six hundred men, and, bidden, lo, they wait : 

112 



T. Sturge Moore 

His voice, a hundredfold its volume now, 

So wields control. Majestic to dictate, 

Moved forth before his friends, rebukes to bow 

The minds of robbers throng into his thoughts : 

He stands to choose before their ranked cohorts. 

A mocking voice intrudes, " What aileth thee ? 

Why comest thou with such a company ? " 

Then Micah gasps : " My gods ye have taken away, 

Both which I made ; the priest he too is gone ; 

What have I more? Am I then wondered on 

Coming amongst you ? How is it ? Ye say 

4 What aileth thee ? ' " " We, if you must know why, 

Are six to one." In feigned concern some cry, 

" Let not thy voice be heard amongst us, lest 

Some angry fellows run upon thee, then 

Thou mightest lose thy life ; yea, thou wert best, 

For sake of these thy household, with young men 

To hold thy peace, since such have froward wills, 

And crying oft provoketh further ills." 

Micah must turn; they are too strong for him, 

And, round him turning, hills, trees, neighbours swim. 

They led him home : he heard each kind friend's word, 

Yet seemed to them as though he hardly heard. 

The^kill was steep to climb again, and high 

The sun rode; earth was baked; his mouth was dry. 

The dust in the deep ruts felt soft as mud ; 

A hush lay on the country; chewing cud, 

The cattle kept the shade ; and dotted trees 

On distant hills did still as rocks remain ; 

For, void of breath and destitute of ease, 

No hint that God was moving gave the plain. 

His mother came to meet him ; she was kind ; 

His woe more than their loss distressed her mind. 

She led him in, spoke something, touched his sleeve ; 

"3 * 



7". Sturge Moore 

And every act brought a minute reprieve 

From that too present blank crushed on his sense. 

Micah must from the poor receive an alms. 

Ere life's jammed movements regain due suspense ; 

What servants do helps more than costly balms. 

To watch the swallows if the eye be caught 

Sufficient proves to slack the bonds of thought. 

The rich indeed few turns of fate can bless, 

Yet many leave those who own much with less. 

When put to native poverty again 

Men hardy-to-feel-rich must pay dire toll ; 

Their thriftless thrift results in abjedt pain. 

Than such a man it takes a wealthier soul 

To count with loss. Above the Promised Land, 

Though it lie distant, let but Moses stand 

And see forbidden entrance, he is blest, 

And angels lay him quite content to rest. 

" Since I have seen thy face let me now die " 

Said Israel to Joseph ; listen why. 

" Because thou art alive still whom I wept 

And mourned for dead.'' Such airy food has kept 

The strong soul fine ; possession were too much : 

Since mind conceives, why should the coarse hand touch ? 

His gods had still less power in Micah's breast 
Than in the world, so on his mind scorn pressed 
With "Lords, though eyed with jasper, who are kind 
And cruel fickly, might as well be blind. 
What, do these chaunting women gain relief, 
While I who wealth have lavished ache in grief ! 
Dumb is my woe, but theirs with words is fed 
Copiously gushing as for strong man dead : " 

" Wail, O nest of eagles young ! 
Since those are now taken away 

114 



T. Sturge ZMoore 

Who nursed ye, on the hill-crest hung, 

Cry out, bestir, and clamour with the tongue 

For this fair-shining is a cruel day ! 

" How shall henceforth any know 

Surely of the coming rain ? 

When the seed 'twere best to sow, 

Now or not yet ? What will show ? 

Things when lost must aye remain 

In the corner where they rolled 

Even should they be of gold. 

Ailing babes will wail in vain, 

Will pine, will perish ; watched, not helped in pain. 

" Weep, for the Ephod is gone ! 

To us it no more will give 

Urim nor Thummim ; but on 

Our eyes night drops; we live 

Henceforth as the blind, we cry 

Like little foxes from holes 

When their mother is fast in the snare 

We cry but what help is there ? 

Great silence overwhelms our souls. 

" Man's words in this strange world no more avail 
Than in our midst the new-born child's sad wail. 
Thus ringed by elder natures must we weep ; 
Though Thunder speak, the thought is passing deep. 
And who can read the faces of the clouds 
Or penetrate the mystery that shrouds 
The placid smiling of the sky ? 
Then lift ye up the voice and cry ! 
Our Gods perchance may hear 
They yet are somewhat near. 



T. Sturge Moore 

For if they turn not back ye are forlorn ; 
Midnight is silent and the Noon ; 
Who shall whisper with the Morn? 
With the Evening who commune? 
These counsel with themselves alone 
To no man is their favour shown. 
Then cry aloud, be urgent in your wail ; 
When all else fails, persistence may avail." 

All round him rose a coolness of stone walls ; 
Translucent vine-leaves softly laced the glare 
Which else had trespassed through the portal deep. 
Along the walls stood vintage of old years 
In massive jars high as a woman's chin, 
A thick dust mantling each round-shouldered well. 
Bundles of herbs, baskets and pruning hooks, 
Hung from the cedarn rafters, vague in gloom ; 
And on the smooth-planed table there was fruit 
Damsons and pears, while, from its trencher, sliced 
A crusted melon, luscious womb of seeds, 
Glowed and shed fragrance. Audible, since they 
Have ceased to sing, the gurgling spring tunes time, 
And keeps in mind the cavernous cool rocks, 
Umbrageous trees, and many a hazy glimpse 
Across the basking plains, whereto his vines 
Slope with their mellow ranks of rustling leaves. 
But 'mid the little chapel's hollow walls 
Now dwells an aching absence where his gods 
Had stood in glimmering splendour to protect, 
For ever smiling on a pile of gifts 
Crisp flowery loaves and golden maize and doves, 
Grey doves with yellow plumage round their necks, 
With ribbed feet tied, drooped wings and blue veiled 
eyes. 

116 



T. Sturge ^Moore 

No more will some two hundred kneel for awe, 
No shout of praise start every rock to tell, 
And loudly tell, Jehovah's glorious name ; 
Nor will he joy in prestige erewhile his, 
A rich and envied god-possessing man. 

Beyond his fathers wise, he had had suck 
Of all the abundance which in seas is found, 
And of the treasures hidden in the sand. 
Close speech with swarthy captains had he held, 
And placed much confidence in ships ; yet kept 
Well-watered vineyards, sounding fields of corn. 
His beard was black ; still hale and firm his limbs ; 
The fuller's finest white with scarlet fringe 
He wore, and it became him ; chains of gold 
At feast and wedding jangled on his breast; 
Damsels still met him blushing younger men 
Passed for less handsome. What harsh climax now 
Crowned his content ? the gratitude of Gods, 
Whose images, made from his mother's gold, 
He honoured, and was honoured in return, 
Till now, he thought. Yet still the thunder failed 
To bring their state home ; wrathful agencies 
Muttered not, mustering round the massive forms 
Of Ebal and of Gerizim. His wife 
And mother only dream of succour now. 
Yes, they are cooking : from the further room 
Come and return ; they sigh, but taste the broth, 
And know how much salt lacks. Trivial concern 
Divides their hearts with woe : life's menials they, 
Incapable of concentrated aim. 
They grudge to risk their wealth on Tyrian trade ; 
And when they see it doubled, "Praise the Lord! " 
Appropriate seems to them. But men face risk, 

117 



T. Sturge ZMoore 

Can calculate and gain ; therefore to them 
Loss is calamity; girls buoyed on chance 
Have not the strength to feel. And yet he went, 
When told the supper waited him above. 

The roof of that tall house lightly was raised 
On slender colonnettes set nigh as close 
As palings : Micah through their intervals 
Had oft at leisure from his couch surveyed 
The plain stretched round him ; slingers in the corn ; 
The wine-press whither they bring in his grapes : 
Unmuzzled and well-fed, slow oxen trod 
The terrace threshing-floor. His children near 
Played on all fours ; his wife would bend her down 
To kiss him, having crooned some song he loved. 
And still to-day his eyes are fond enough 
To rest upon the hills, to weigh the worth 
Of this year's vintage, watch the labourers' heads 
Appear and disappear beyond the brink 
Of his new vat : languidly stray his eyes ; 
Anon he finds them choosing from the meats. 
His palate next approves : his lips return 
His mother's smile. Yet is his good soul hurt 
At every acquiescence : yet less hurt 
Each time ; and so he slips into fond ease, 
Half conscious of some failure, discontent 
To be content. The long day closes in, 
And on the cooing dove-cot comes a lull ; 
The night wind whispers o'er the corn ; the pipe 
Of some boy goat-herd reedlike from the cliffs 
Trembles and dies away. He seeks his bed. 
And as a girl who quits her home to serve 
In some rich house, and wear far gayer clothes, 
(Dance, song, and work with beads, henceforth her tasks) 

118 



T. Sturge Moore 

Heart-broken feels when first she hears that news ; 
Yet presently the talk and bustle scare 
Her sorrow till she smiling takes her leave: 
So Micah, quit of all deep feeling, smiled ; 
And, to the sound of water gurgling o'er 
Its vaulted rocky well, entered on realms 
Of slumber soother than the world. But as 
Mid those less strenuous days a sense of loss 
Returns upon that girl, bewild'ring, fraught 
With blunt remorse, indefinite rebuke, 
And makes her sob in bed at night, so now 
Into his first light sleep, disquiet crept : 
As when the night wind comes across the sea, 
Sweeps through the halls and markets and dense streets 
That crowd a haven, steady and cold and salt : 
Drives forth foul odours, penetrates dark dens, 
To wearied slaves brings sleep, to fevered death : 
Shakes the low tavern door ends the carouse 
Of drunken sailors, blowing out their lamp, 
And moaning with the voice of comrades drowned : 
So now through Micah's brain discomfort came. 
Salt as with tears and set one way like wind, 
Drove through him, roused compunction for the pain 
Deserted with such ease, jostled bland dreams 
As serried soldiers elbow through the throngs 
Of chatty market folk ; and no man knows 
Aught of their orders, though all dread to learn 
Whether some heavier tax be levied now 
Corvee exacted on some boast in stone 
Or whether their king's mind has taken late 
A sanguinary ply, because in sleep 
He hears a long blade on a smooth wet stone 
Pass and re-pass ; and then a silence falls 
As though who whets it, curious of the edge, 

119 



T. Sturge ZMoore 



Slipped it along his thumb and smiled but soon 
Recurs the regular lisp 'twixt steel and stone. 
Loud Micah's heart beat as men's then will beat 
Guessed at a wrath no more to be forestalled 
Than such a fear-besotted tyrant's rage 
Stopped dead as their hearts stop when all at once 
The trumpets snarl ear-splitting o'er the booths. 
It was as though a thunder pealed him words : 
" Shall gods depart, yet be so briefly mourned? " 
Then, compassed round with cloud, the cherubim 
Bowed with the heavens and came down, while he 
Cowered and kept his face pressed on the dust, 
Expecting death : but ah ! they turned their wheels 
Which did not crunch across his abject corse, 
Yet rumbled near, continuing less loud 
Until they passed from ear-shot. Long he ached 
In pulseless silence and black void. 

A child 

Abandoned in the dark begins to wail, 
Then, panic-goaded, daring never stop, 
In one continuous scream throws back its head, 
And seeks to drive life's self forth with the sound, 
Till suffocated, stunned, faint, it must lie 
And cough. So Micah dreamed he did, and heard 
After interminable flagging throbs 
His mother move from near him with a lamp 
And say: "He sleeps again," pause and then add 
" He breatheth quietly; come, leave him now! " 
Hot with strange shame, grown man with child confused, 
Some time elapsed ere he became aware 
That, round the chamber where his bed was set, 
Rain made such sound as when it long hath rained.

dozen herd-boys. 

Boys. 

MOTHER Yashoda! Mother Yashoda! 
Tashoda. Go away, bad boys ! Go away !

And you, Valarama, come in with you quick.

Didn't I say that Krishna and you 
Were not to go out to the jungle to-day ? 
Boys. Mother Yashoda, we want our Krishna. 
The time is come for our sport and play. 
The cows are lowing, the sky is blue; 
The Vrinda meadows are fresh with dew. 
We must be going, and Krishna too. 
Make him ready to come with us. 
Y as ho da. Nay ! 

Krishna must bide at home to-day. 
Valarama. But why, mother, why ? 
Tashoda. He 's ill in bed with a shivering fever. 
Valarama. Oh, what a lie ! 
Tashoda. So make no noise, 

For he 's just gone to sleep. 

Valarama. Don't you believe her. 

Yashoda. Begone, or you'll wake him, you ragamuffin 
boys. \^A flute is heard from within the house. 
Boys. Listen! Oh, that is his flute. Clear and gay 
He pipes, " to the meadows away, away ! " 
Silly little mother, will you tell us still 
That our darling Krishna's asleep or ill ? 
Tashoda. Sick or sound, he shall bide at home. 
Never again with you shall he roam, 
Tearing his clothes at wrestling and racing, 
Risking his neck up monkey-chasing, 
(Yes, I know all your madcap pranks,) 
Diving down from Jumna's banks 
Into crocodile pools. No, no, little fools, 
Henceforth he bides with me at home. 
Boys. How cross and stupid these grown-up folks are ! 
Come, we must sing our very best to coax her. 
Listen awhile, we pray, 
Mother Yashoda dear. 

124 



C. Trevelyan 



Give us our Krishna for this one day, 
This one day in the whole long year. 
Nothing is there for you to fear : 
For of him we will take great care. 
In the midst of us all shall he go like a king. 
We will carry his flute and his staff. 
So merry is Krishna, as a bird on the wing, 
That he dances along as he goes. 
If thorny or rough be the path, 
On our shoulders high will we carry him. 
When the sun's rays grow too strong, 
To a tree's cool shadow will we lead him. 
There shall he rest, while we how best 
To please him strive. But if perchance, 
Tired with frolic, faint from the dance, 
We see him pale, with wild-wood fruits 
And berries will we feed him. 

Tashoda. And poison him too: yes, that would you do, 
Go, you scamps, go. 

Boys. Poison our darling Krishna! No! 
We can tell good from evil fruit 
As well as any root-fed Rishi can do. 
Give us our Krishna, Yashoda dear. 
If he come not with us to-day, 
If we hear not the sound of his flute, 
How shall we dance and be gay? 
The peacock, the cuckoo, the bee, 
And the squirrel high up in the banyan tree 
Are waiting and listening with eager ear 
To catch the sound of his pipings. 
If we haven't our Krishna, whose dark hair 
Shall we crown with peacock plumes, and deck 
With bright wild flowers? 
We will make him sit in the midst of us 

125 



C. Trevelyan 

Under the cool Kadamva bowers, 

And pipe to us, while we 

Wreathe him a garland for his neck 

Of champak blossoms and all gay flowers 

That in Vrinda's groves and meadows be, 

On stalk or tree, 

Malaka, Kunda and Madhavi. 

Then suffer him, mother, to go. 

If they see not his sweet face, 

The cows will not drink or graze. 

If they hear not Krishna's flute, 

They will not so much as low, 

But will stand like carved things mute. 

Your son, little mother, has magic arts. 

All things that have ears and hearts, 

Silly cattle and beasts and men, 

When they hear his pipe, must obey his will : 

In his music is such sweet force.

See their holiest visions then ; 

And the Jumna stays in her course. 

Tashoda. Spare your song. Though all day long 

You stand here begging, you won't coax me, 

For all your noise, to let him go free, 

You good-for-nothing boys. 

Boys. [Making a rush for the door, and trying to force 

their way past YASHODA into the housel\ 
Then we must take him ; and away we'll go, 
Whether his mother may wish it or no. 
In at the door like a swarm 
Of angry bees we'll storm. 
Let her scold and stamp and tear her hair, 
We won't care. 

Tashoda. Wicked boys, do you dare ! 

126 



. C. Trevelyan 



Away with you, thieves, or you'll taste my stick. 
Ho, neighbours, neighbours! hither! come quick! 
They would carry my Krishna away. 
Boys. Krishna ! Krishna ! We can't get through : 
Her stick 's so thick. Oh, what shall we do ? 
Must we go without you to-day? 

[During the scuffle KRISHNA climbs out unnoticed 
through a window at the side^ and standing 
behind the boys^ sets his flute to his lips and 
'plays a few notes. 

Boys. Hark! His flute! Oh see, that 's he ! 
Krishna ! Krishna ! 

[They rush back to where KRISHNA is standing. 
Away to the jungle away, away ! 
Silly little mother, goodbye, goodbye ! 
Catch us if you can in the trees so high. 
We'll teach you to climb. Come try, come try. 

[KRISHNA and the Boys run off together in the 

direction of the jungle. 
Tashoda. Krishna, you cruel boy, come back ! They're 

gone ; they're out of earshot, 

Off to the jungle bounding like a pack of pelted 
monkeys. 



Enter NEIGHBOUR. 

Neighbour. Yashoda, what 's the matter ? What meant 
all that hurley-burly ? 

Tashoda. It was those wicked cowherd boys: they've 
stolen away my Krishna, 

To the jungle yes, and I've no more the legs or breath 
to chase them. 

Neighbour. Why, mother, is your Krishna still an in 
fant in the cradle, 

127 



. C. Trevelyan 



That you should swaddle him up at home, and keep him 

from his playmates ? 
Tashoda. Do you not know how all his life demons 

and evil yakshas 
Have sought to lure him within their power, to kidnap 

or destroy him ? 
Neighbour. So far it seems your Krishna's proved a 

match for all these demons. 
Take my advice and pray to Vishnu. He'll be the lad's 

best keeper. [Exit NEIGHBOUR. 

Tashoda. Vishnu ! To him how oft have I not prayed ? 
But who knows when the Gods have heard ? 'Tis said, 
Ofttimes like men they sleep, or sit and watch 
Apsaras dancing. How then should they catch 
The sighs of us poor mortals ? And they tell 
How from their heavens the Gods descend and dwell 
Within the bodies of wild beasts and men. 
Can they have ears to listen to us then? 
Those boys spoke true : rny son has magic arts ; 
Or why should he have such power over all hearts ? 
I sometimes think, so different he seems 
From all else, that a God's soul, in its dreams, 
Oft enters him, and lodges there awhile. 
Did not sage Rishis journey mile on mile 
To behold him in his cradle, and bow low 
Worshipping him with gifts and prayers, as though 
He were indeed a great God visiting us ? 
But I am not so vain and credulous 
As to believe all the fine tales and lies 
These Yogis cheat us with to win more rice. 
Well, when my household tasks are done, I'll go 
To fetch him home, be he a God or no. 

[She goes into the house.

SCENE II 

The Vrinda forest^ near the banks of the Jumna. Under 
the broad shade of a feepul tree sits an aged RISHI, 
in an attitude of tranced meditation. 

Krishna. 

WHEN she smiles, how beautiful is my Radha ; 
When like clear skies after rain 
Her eyes are filled with laughter again, 
And shyly gazing into mine 
Seem to plead : 

" Ask not why so early from my comrades 
I stole away ; ask not why so bright 
Yon moon is rising, nor for whom to-night 
My loveliness is more lovely : 
Only come, come now to the jungle with me, 
Krishna, my playmate." 

Ah but then most beautiful is my Radha, 

When her scornfully flashing eyes 

Mock me as lightning from dark skies. 

Then deeply beyond their anger and disdain 

Gazing, there I read 

All that within her heart is lurking, 

In secret working unconfessed, 

Hope and wistful fear and yearning pain, 

Innocent tenderness, reluctant 

Proud hesitation and wayward guile. 

Then my heart leaps joyfully, like a mother's, 

When her child turns gravely from her breast, 

129 K. 



C. Trevelyan 



And gazing upward into her eyes, the first time 

Kindles answering smile for smile. 

[He now notices the RISHI. 

What is this ? Who is here ? 

Some saintly Rishi lapsed in trance. More still 

He seems than a deserted ant-hill, and 

As void perchance of any thought or joy. 

Vishnu preserve me from such torpid saintliness ! 

Yet have I heard men say that when the mind 

And bodily senses sleep, the wakeful soul 

Delightedly goes forth and wandering sees 

Visions divine and glorious, unbeheld 

By mortals else. If that be so, maybe 

Were I to waken now within my flute 

A solemn yet a rapturous melody, 

Who knows but it may open wide the gate 

Of Indra's Paradise to this poor Yogi, 

And bathe his parching spirit a brief while 

In rivers of living joy? 

\He flays a melody on his flute. T'he music 
gradually rouses the RISHI from his trance. 
KRISHNA stops playing; and the RISHI, 
who, though now fully awake ^ does not see 
KRISHNA, speaks with his hands joined in 
adoration. 

Rishi. Vishnu ! Almighty Vishnu ! 

To thee be praise ! 

Among the Gods in Swarga have I been. 

Yet at first I saw there 

Gloom only and despair; 

And a voice I heard that cried : 

" Where is our Vishnu, where ? " 

And at that word 

I saw Gods shudder and turn pale, 

130 



C. Trevelyan 



And heard the Apsaras and Ghandavas wail: 

The Heavens grew dark, and all awhile sat mute : 

When from afar was heard 

The faint note of a flute, 

More near, more near, till in the midst there stood 

A youth, a shepherd boy, who played 

Such melodies on his flute as made 

The eyes of Gods grow dim, 

And their hearts marvellously set free 

To wander forth delightedly 

From their grief-gloomed selves to him, 

Where his slender limbs to the music swayed. 

Listening and beholding then 

All knew him, the beloved, the adored 

Of Gods and mortal men, 

Their Vishnu, to their sight restored. 

But the flute ceased, and a change came,' 

And the dream of bliss was ended : 

For the light of Heaven darkened, 

As away the vision faded. 

Grief-consumed and again bereft 

Of him they loved were the Gods left. 

I too wake to the world's woe. 

[KRISHNA sounds his flute again; the RISHI 
looks up and sees him, then falls at his 
feef y worshipping him. 
Ah! The flute! 
It is He! 

Krishna. Good Yogi, rise. Where are your wits astray, 
That you should take me for a God to worship? 
Rishi. Art thou not then . . . ? 

Krishna. Yes ! Who I am, you know. 

Rishi. Who art thou ? I am old : my sight is dim. 
Krishna. I am Krishna, Nanda and Yashoda's son. 



. C. Trevelyan 



Rishi. Krishna, my child, was it thy flute I heard ? 

Krishna. My flute it was. Good Rishi, I did ill 

If by my foolish pipings your deep thoughts 

And saintly meditations were disturbed. 

Rishi. Nay, child, but there was magic in thy flute : 

How else should I have seen what I have seen ? 

Twenty years in this forest have I dwelt ; 

But never yet, fast and afflict my body 

Austerely as I might, could I attain 

True vision of the Gods until this hour. 

Blest be thy flute, and the lips that played thereon. 

Boys. \Without .] Krishna! Where are you hiding? 

Krishna ! 
Krishna. Hark! they are coming. They've followed 

the flute. 

Old man, now mind: not a word to them of me! 
Not a nod ! Keep still and mum as a root. 
Goodbye ! Now for this peepul tree ! 

[KRISHNA climbs up quickly into the peepul tree. 
The RISHI resumes his attitude of medita 
tion. 

Enter VALARAMA, SUDAMA, SUBALA, and the other herd- 
boys^ running. 

Boys. Krishna! Krishna! 

Sudama. This way ! It was here I heard it last. 

Valarama. Hi! not so fast! It 's just such a place 

He'ld choose to hide in. 

Subala. Oh what a shame 

To lead us such a chase ! 

Where in the world has he got to ? 

He 's always up to some trick or other. 

Valarama, you're his brother : 

It 's for you to tell him not to. 

132 



. C. Trevelan 



Valarama. I'm not to blame. Haven't I done so 

A thousand times? But it 's all the same: 

It 's never any use. 

Sudama. Come, why should we run so ? 

If he wants to tease, why play his game ? 

Look, there 's the old Yogi. 

Another Boy. Yogi, please, 

Has Krishna been your way ? 

Another. Have you seen him atall to-day ? 

Another. Is he hiding among those trees ? 

Wont you give us a word or a nod ? 

Another. Give him a prod. He cant have heard. 

Another. It 's no use : leave him. He hasn't a word 

For anyone less than a God. 

Sudama. Come, let 's sit down and cool ourselves under 

this shady peepul. 
See here the grass is fresh and soft, the very place for 

dozing. 
It 's full noon now, and all the birds are silent save the 

kokilas. 

Let Krishna play at hide and seek alone, if he 's a mind to. 
Subala. Maybe it 's Radha and the Gopis he 's playing 

hide and seek with. 
Another Boy. Well, be his game whatever it may, why 

should we fash to find him ? 
Sudama. Still, I do wish we had him here. One feels so 

dull without him. 

What shall we do to pass the time ? 
Valarama. Why, sleep. 

Sudama. But I'm not sleepy. 

Come, someone, tell us a story, do, of Rama or of Shiva. 

\_A silence. 

How is it that we miss him so ? It 's no use our pre 
tending : 

133 



. C. Trevelyan 



When he 's away one feels as cross and stupid as a 

buffalo. [A silence. 

Subala. Where are the cows ? They must be lost. Well 

now there'll be some trouble. 
It 's Krishna's fault. When we missed him^ of course 

we quite forgot them. 
Another Boy. Look, there they come. Count them, 

Sudama. 'My counting stops at twenty. 
Sudama. They're all there, the whole thirty-six; even 

Draupadi, the lame one. 
Look at them. Aren't they a lovely sight. No girls 

are half so pretty. 
Yet girls wear bangles, ear-rings, chains of pearls or 

gold and silver ; 
While cows wear nothing, or at best some miserable 

necklace 
Of blue and yellow beads. Just think ; if we could only 

make them 
A necklace each of pearls, how fine and beautiful they'ld 

look then! 
Valarama. Yes, they'ld look fine no doubt. But how 

do you propose, Sudama, 
To find your pearls ? If you expect to pick them from 

a pearl-bush, 

I'm thinking you may have to plant one first. 
Sudama. Well, since they aren't stones, 

They must grow somewhere, I suppose: else how 

should the girls come by them ? 
Valarama. They're bought at fairs for cowries. 
Sudama. Yes, but how do the shopmen get them ? 

If only Krishna now were here, I'm certain he would 

teach us 
How to make pearls as fast as clouds pelt hail-stones 

when it thunders. 

134 



C. Trevelyan 



Krishna. [From above in the peepul treel\ Sudama ! 

Sudama. That's his voice. Where are you, Krishna? 

Look, there he sits, up in the peepul tree ! 

Krishna. Go now, Sudama: 

Haste back to the village as my messenger 

To Radha. Say : Krishna has need of one 

Small pearl, one only, from her ears or neck. 

This pearl, if she will grant it, he will sow, 

And from it raise more than a thousand-fold, 

To deck with pearls the dewlaps of our cows. 

Say also that her gift shall be repaid 

Many times over both in pearls and thanks. 

Sudama. But, Krishna, do you really mean to send me 

on such an errand? 
They'll mock me and make me seem a fool, those Gopi 

girls, I know it. 

Krishna. Do as I bid you. Linger not,- but go. 
Valarama. How now, Sudama! 

Afraid of Radha and the girls ? 

Sudama. Well, you go, Valarama, 

Since you're so brave. 
Valarama. Oh no ; it 's you we've always 

thought the hero. 
Sudama. Well, go I must, though I don't want to, since 

so Krishna wills it. \JLxit SUDAMA. 

Subala. Valarama, tell me, (don't speak loud), would 

you yourself have liked it, 
If Krishna had chosen to send you on such a senseless 

errand ? 
Valarama. No indeed. And I'm wondering too, if Radha 

now should lend him 
This pearl, what Krishna would do then, except look 

mighty foolish. 
Sow pearls indeed ! Who ever heard such nonsense ! 



C. Trevelyan 



Krishna. [From above."] Valarama! 

The rest shall have twelve pearls apiece ; you only six, 
and small ones. 



SCENE III 

'The village of Gokula. Lalita, Chandravali and several 
other of the Gopi maidens are sitting in the shade of 
a banyan tree^ watching Radha, who is seated some 
what apart from her companions^ absorbed in her own 
thoughts. 

Chandravali. \_Singing.~\ 
"TV TOW may I go?" 

IN "Ah, no, no! Not yet!" I sighed. 
" The hour is come. 
May I now go?" 
Grief held me dumb. 
" May I go now?" 
He whispered thrice, 
Ere I replied, 

" Go, my love, since it must be so." 
One step he made, 
Then turned to look 
Deep in my eyes : 

Within his hands my hands he took, 
And bade me vow: 
" Though now we part, 
Yet from my heart, 
O my love, thou 
Canst never go." 

Lalita. She does not hear you, Chandra. 
Still she sits staring on the trees, 

136 



C. Trevelyan 



Dreaming with open eyes. 

Radha! . . . 

Will nothing wake her? 

Chandrae ali. She must be bewitched. 

Lalita. Well, if she be, we know by whom. His name 

Perchance may rouse her. I will try. 

Chandravali. No, no! 

It will but anger her. 

Lalita. What if it do ? 

That would be better than this love-sick moping. 

[She sings. ~] Oh ye who say : 

" Forget him. Hath he not forgotten thee? " 

How am I to forget? 

Did I not offer him my soul in play ? 

Did it not fly to him like a bird 

By a fowler's piping lured, 

And perch upon a tree, 

And sing to him ? till he 

Like a fowler caught it in his net, 

And keeps it captive yet. 

Now in his cage he bears me all day long. 

To my sweet song he pays no heed. 

Not though I starve for it, one small seed 

Of pity has he granted me as yet. 

Soon shall I perish. Then alone, 

When thought and memory are flown, 

Dying forgotten shall I forget thee, Krishna. 

Radha. Lalita! what do you mean? 
You know that name is hateful to me. 
Lalita. Hateful? 

It was not always so. 

Radha. Oh, you are pert and sly. Leave me in peace. 

137 



C. Trevelyan 



Lalita. I had hoped to please your mood : but I mistook. 
I ought to have remembered : 
That name was hateful to you : yes. 
But listen now : I'll make amends. 

[She sings."] O ye maidens of Vrindavan, heed my warn 
ing ; do not wander 
Down yon pathway to the jungle, lest you meet with 

such mischance 
As of late befell me there. 
Pleasant are the groves of Vrinda; yet in their cool 

shades there lurks 
A monster, a dread king of Nagas. Deadly is the very 

glance 

Of those bright eyes. Oh beware ! 
Yes beware, for he is gentle : winsome is his shape and 

lovely 
His poised head ; his every motion lures and charms : 

yea, his the art 
To entice and to betray. 
Ere thou art aware his swiftly gliding coils are round 

thee twining, 
And the poison from his deadly kiss is burning up the 

heart 
Of the serpent Krishna's prey. 

[RADHA rises in anger and walks away. 
Chandravali. Oh, you are cruel, Lalita. 
See, she is hurt. You have driven her away. 



Enter SUDAMA. He stands hesitating^ and looks shyly 
round him at the Gopis. 

Lalita. Why, there's Sudama. Look at him how he 
gapes 

138 



. C. Trevelyan 



And stares around him like a duck new-hatched ! 

Whom do you seek, Sudama ? 

Sudama. I want Radha. 

Where is she ? 

Chandravali. There she comes. You'd best beware. 

She'll bite your head off, if you come from Krishna. 

Sudama. Vishnu protect me! How she glares! Oh 

why 

Did Krishna send me here with this fool's message? 
Lalita. Radha, here is Sudama come to speak with you. 
Radha. \_Who has returned^ Well ! Speak ! Why do 

you gape upon me ? 
Sudama. Krishna sent me . . . 
Radha. ^Turning to go.~\ Krishna ! 
Lalita. But you must stay and hear him. 
Radha. Well, what is it? 

Sudama. Krishna sent me to ask of you a pearl, 
Just one pearl from your necklace or your ears . . . 
Lalita. What should he want a pearl for? 
Sudama. For our cows ; 

To make pearl- strings to hang their dewlaps with. 
Chandravali. And pray, what use would one pearl be 

for that ? 

Sudama. He means, you see, to plant it in the ground . . . 
One of the Girls. And then ? 

Sudama. Then it will grow to a pearl-tree, so he hopes. 
The Girls. [Laughing^] A pearl- tree! 
Sudama. He says besides, he will pay Radha back 
Many times over both in pearls and thanks. 
Radha. Go to your Krishna : take this answer back. 
Know that pearls grow in sea-shells, not on trees ; 
That they are precious things, not like the flowers 
You pluck in Vrinda's forests every day. 
A notion so extravagant, tell him, please, 



C. Trevelyan 



Is worthy only of an ignorant, 

Stupid, unreasoning cowherd, like himself. 

What ! adorn cows with necklaces of pearl ! 

Could even the most lavish rajah on earth 

Conceive so crazed a fancy. Tell him this 

Moreover, that once every year by night 

From Svati's constellation there descends 

Into each destined shell a mystic ray 

Of fertilizing light : and thus it is 

Are formed those pearls that divers risk their lives 

To fetch from the sea's depth. Let him not deem 

That pearls are things easy and cheap to win 

Like a kadamva or a champak flower. 

"The Girls. Well done, Radha! Look how he stands 

Gaping and blushing and blinking ! 

His crook slips out of his hands. 

Krishna will hardly be pleased, I'm thinking, 

With such an answer as that. 

But his message was nothing but impudent fooling ; 

So it 's all fair tit for tat. 

If the laugh 's gone against him, he deserves his 

schooling. 

Mind, Sudama, you don't forget 
One word of what Radha said. 
Pearls grow on sea-shells, not on trees. 
Pearls are not champak buds, nor yet 
Any kind of flower, whether white or red, 
Pink, yellow or blue. Remember too, 
Svati's the name of the constellation 
Whose love-beams quicken the oyster nation. 
Fix that in your memory, please. 

[SUDAMA retires in confusion. 
Radha. Lalita! 
Lalita. Yes, Radha! 

140 



. C. Trevelyan 



Radha. Hasten, Lalita. Follow behind Sudama : 

Keep hidden among the trees : note all he says 

To Krishna, and how Krishna answers him : 

Is he angry, or seems vexed, or does but laugh. 

Bring me back word of all he says and does. 

Quick now ; but be not seen. 

Lalita. Trust me for that. 

Radha. But haste. 

Lalita. \Aside^\ Ah, Radha, never could you hide 

Your love-sick thoughts from me, for all your pride. 

[Exit LALITA, 



SCENE IV 

same as Scene II. The RISHI is still sitting under 
the peepul tree. KRISHNA and the herd-boys are 
lying or sitting idly on the grass here and there. 
SUDAMA stands before KRISHNA. LALITA crouches in 
hiding behind a bush^ watching and listening. 

Krishna. 

RADHA spoke so, Sudama ? 
Sudama. Yes, just so. 

Krishna. Unreasoning? Ignorant? She spoke those 

words ? 

Sudama. Those were her very words : I am quite sure. 
Lalita. \Aside '.] Ignorant, stupid, and unreasoning ; 
Yes, and a cowherd too. 

Krishna. She will be sorry for them soon perhaps. 
Sudama. What will you do now, Krishna? Our fine plan 
Is spoilt, it seems, without a pearl to plant. 
Valarama. He does look vexed. Best let him be awhile. 
I've never seen him so put out before. 

141 



C. Trevelyan 



Subala. Small wonder too, after her shrewd reply. 
Oh, you can see it 's not the pearl so much, 
As Radha' s scorn. That 's touched him to the quick. 
Valarama. If I'd been Radha, I'ld have sent the pearl. 
He'ld look more foolish then than he does now. 
Sudama. Dont be so sure. It 's my belief that Radha 
Will yet feel sorry she tried to mock our Krishna. 
Lalita. \_Aside.~] Then Radha will be changed. 
Radha was never sorry. 

Enter YASHODA. 

Tashoda. Krishna, where are you ? Krishna ! Krishna ! 
A Boy. What 's that ? Why, it 's Yashoda. 

Tashoda. Ah, now I've found you, wicked boys. 
A Boy. Yes, now there'll be some trouble. 

Tashoda. Come home at once. How dare you play the 

truant from your mother, 
And make her run through hissing snakes and tigers 

hither to fetch you? 
And you, you scamps, how dare you steal my Krishna, 

when I told you 
That he was ill ? 

Krishna. Yes, mother dear ; 

It's true I'm ill: but never fear; 
There 's one thing that will cure me. 
Tashoda. Oh say, what is that? 
Krishna. But will you swear 

To let me have it then ? 
Tashoda. Why, yes; 

Of course I will. 

Boys. If Krishna's ill, 

The reason why is easy to guess. 
What is his sickness we all know, 
And whom he caught it from ; and so 

142 



C. Trevelyan 



Do Radha and the Gopis. 

Tashoda. How faint he looks. He seems in pain. 

Quick, tell me what you want, poor child. 

Krishna. A small thing, mother darling. 

Just one small pearl from your neck-chain. 

You soon shall have it back again, 

And new ones too, I promise. 

Tashoda. Is that all? There! Take which you will 

Since pining for it has made you ill. 

Though I don't quite see why that should be. 

Krishna. Now you shall see why, mother. 

Boys. What will he do with it? Now shall we know 

whether Krishna 

Merely was boasting at random, or meant it in earnest, 
When from a pearl he professed he could raise up a 

pearl- tree. 

Thoughtfully, see, in the palm of his hand he inspects it. 
Doubting he stands in a quandary. O silly Krishna, 
Are you a God or a Rishi to work such a wonder ? 
Nay, but have patience awhile. 
See, with a confident smile 

How he dibbles the soil with his wand, and with heed 
Plants in the hole his miraculous seed ! 
Yashoda. Krishna ! Krishna ! What have you done ! 
Have you buried my pearl ? So you meant to make fun 
Of your poor old mother before this crew 
Of rascally boys ? Oh shame on you ! 
Boys. Mother Yashoda, now dont be a scold. 
See, he has covered it up with mould ! 
With a smile he turns away. 
To his lip he sets his flute. 
Look ! he is going to play. 
Does he fancy the pearl will obey, 
And striking a root like a seed will shoot 

H3 



. C. Trevelyan 



Up through the ground to his piping's sound? 

Let him pipe for a year and a day, 

A pearl is a pearl, I say. 

Lalita. [Asidt .] If Radha had lent him a pearl from 

her ear, 

She'ld never have seen it again, that 's clear. 
On a fool she'ld have thrown it away. 
Sudama. Subala, look, oh look! The soil's lifting! 

there ! 
Subala. Nonsense ! I see nothing. Not a grain 's stirred, 

not one. 
Sudama. Yes, but it heaves, see! ever so little, just 

there ! 
Valarama. Wonderful! Yes, it breaks. Pushing its 

way it comes, 

A tiny spikelet of grey ! The pearl-tree is born, it is born ! 
Sudama. Oh that Radha were here to see ! 
Wouldn't she just look foolish now? 
Lalita. \_Aside^\ Yes indeed, poor foolish girl ! 
Subala. What 's so wonderful in this tree? 
Wait until he can show us a pearl 
Hanging upon a pearl-tree bough. 
Sudama. Already it 's grown seven inches tall. 
Valarama. No, ten. 

Another Boy. Why, surely it 's over a foot. 

Subala. What if it 's no real tree atall, 
But a false delusion, a cheating charm 
Cast over our minds by Krishna's flute ? 
Sudama. No, for I've touched it. You too try. 
It 's just as real as you or I. 
Another Boy. I've measured it : see, it 's as long as my 

arm. 
Another. Look at those buds: they're beginning to 

sprout. 

144 



. C. Trevelyan 

On every side it 's branching out. 

Leaf, tendril and shoot. 

Subala. But where 's the fruit ? 

Sudama. Wider and thicker and higher and quicker 

It 's spreading and curling, expanding, unfurling. 

Subala. But I dont see it pearling. 

Another Boy. What is that? Do you see? Oh, what 

can it be ? 

That tiniest grain, as small and bright as the eye 
Of a moth or a wren or a blue dragonfly, 
Or a droplet of rain ! 

Oh look, look again ! It is growing, it is swelling. 
And look, there are others, two, three, four and five ! 
The whole tree 's alive 

With dozens and fifties and hundreds past telling 
Of pearls, bright pearls. 
Every moment they're gleaming both, brighter and 

plumper. 

See there, what a bumper! 

Krishna, our Krishna ! There 's none like our Krishna. 
Oh, what would not Radha and the Gopi girls 
Give now to be here ? 
Krishna. There, mother dear ! There 's your pearl back 

again. 

Tashoda. O Krishna, my joy ! 

Krishna. There are some for your ear ; 

And there 's a good handful to make a new chain. 
Boys. Come, let us pick them and prick them and thread 

them on twine, 
And make of them chains to engarland the necks of our 

kine ; 

Yes, and our own necks too. Oh, shant we look fine ! 
Then home to the byres and the milking in triumph 

we'll lead them, 

145 L 



C. Trevelyan 



Dancing and frolicking, joking and laughing and singing. 
Though the Gopis come weeping and begging and 

clinging, 

Not a glance will we give, not a pearl great or small, 
Till Radha grow humble, and Krishna forgive. 
Lalita. [dside.~\ Poor Radha, humbled wilt thou be 

indeed ; 

And for forgiveness sore will be thy need. 
Now must I hasten back with my strange news. 
Nought truly in the telling shall it lose. [Exit LALITA. 



SCENE V 

The village of Gokula ; the same as Scene III. 

Lalita. 

AH, had you but been there to see ! 
Radha. Yes, then 

I might have known the truth. 

Lalita. Why should you doubt me ? 

Radha. Give me some proof, instead of all these words. 
You talk of pearls in myriads ; yet not one 
Have you brought back to show me. 
Lalita. How could I, Radha ? 

Did you not bid me keep myself close hidden ? 
Radha. Well, then? 

Lalita. Why, then I rose and stole away : 

But as I looked back through the leaves I saw 
That now from a bush it had become a tree 
Tall as the tallest there, its every bough 
Glancing and glimmering with a robe of pearls, 
One flame of silver fire : and there, high up 

146 



C. Trevelyan 



Among the branches clambering they swarmed 

With shouts and laughter, shaking down the pearls, 

Others below gathering them as they showered, 

Piercing and threading them . . . 

Radha. Piercing indeed! 

These pearls of yours must have been strange ones, soft 

As grapes or rose-buds to be pierced so easily. 

Lalita. Which would you deem the greater miracle, 

From a pearl to raise a pearl-tree, or to give power 

To pierce with needles his own magic fruit? 

Radha. Needles ! Whence had these cowherds needles? 

Did 

The pearl-tree bear them too ? 
Lalita. No, 'twas Yashoda. 

She found them needles. And all the while aloof 
Stood Krishna, unconcerned, heedless of all 
Save his flute's melody ; while the enchanted herd 
Thronged round him gazing, and forgot 'to feed. 
Radha. Oh, I am out of patience with your mockery. 
Lalita. Radha, believe me, I have told you truth, 
As an hour hence you'll know, when they come leading 
Their cattle home, crowned and festooned with pearls, 
Their own necks too like rajahs garlanded. 
What then will pride avail you against their ribaldries 
And Krishna's vengeful triumph and disdain ? 
What, save to augment grief's shame? Be wise, and 

seek 

That pardon, which he waits for but one word 
Freely to give. 

Radha. His pardon ! Never, Lalita ! 

Leave me, leave me. I will not hear you more. 

\Exit LALITA. 

No, I will not believe. Or if I must, 
Yet not for that will I be humble to him.

Ah Pride, Pride, thou infidel, 

Thou jealous tyrant, why 

Art thou so strong, and I, 

Thy slave, so weak that I dare not rebel ? 

Dare not obey my own heart when it calls ? 

Why is to yield impossible, 

Though alone by yielding first 

May longed-for happiness be mine ? 

Thus perishing with love's thirst 

By the well's brink I pine. 

Already twilight falls. 

One thing there is ere it be night 

That I must do in pride's despite. 

To the jungle must I hasten, and there with my own 

eyes 

Learn whether Lalita spoke truth, or was it lies. 
Quick, then, while there is light to see ! 
It was under the sacred peepul tree, 
Where sits the old Rishi night and day 
Near Jumna's banks. I cannot miss the way. \Exit. 



SCENE VI 

Under the peepul tree^ where the RISHI still sits, as in 
Scenes II and III. Enter RADHA. 

Radha. 

THE sun sets : nig'ht draws round : 
And I am here alone. 

How long it seems since last I heard the sound 
Of laughter and singing, and so left the path, 
Following them in vain ! By now they must 

148 



. C. Trevelyan 



Have reached the village. Ah ! 

Yonder is the peepul tree. Is this the place? 

But where are they ? And he ? 

And where is . . . ? Oh my folly . . . ! 

If it was here, 'tis vanished. And yet here 

They must have been : for the grass is trodden down 

By hooves and feet. And there the Rishi sits. 

I will approach and speak with him. Sanyassin, 

Tell me, I pray, was Krishna here but now? 

Rishi. Who art thou ? 

Radha. I am Radha. I seek Krishna, 

The son of Nanda. Hast thou not seen him here ? 

Rishi. Him whom men call Krishna I have seen, 

And I have heard his flute. 

Radha. But why has vanished 

His pearl-sown tree ? Was it not here it grew ? 

Rishi. Canst thou not see it? 

Radha. No ; I see nothing here. 

Rishi. The proud in heart see nought. Pride blinds 

their eyes. 

Radha. Oh, I am proud no more : yet am I blind. 
Rishi. Then thou shalt see perchance, when 'tis his will. 
Radha. Alas, weak is my faith : but I repent 
My pride and folly now. Thou art wise : tell me, 
How may I find my Krishna ? 
Rishi. When so he wills. 

Radha. Ay me! I have scorned, faithlessly scorned 

him. Now 

He scorns and rejects me. 

Rishi. Krishna scorns none 

Who seek him with desire. 
Radha. I desire ; I seek ; 

And finding not, must perish. Oh tell me how 
Am I to find him ? 

149 



C. Trevelyan 



Rishi. That thou alone canst know. 

[RADHA turns away. 
Radha. Night falls round me : 
Within me is night. 
Yonder stars mock me. 
In my heart shines 
No star, no moon, 
No hope of light. 
Then death come soon, 
Since he 

Hath willed it so. 
Yet not he, no, 

'Twas I who scorned him, I who killed 
That light whereby 
My life he filled. 

Would that again 

I might behold my Krishna's face, 

But one last glance, 

Before I die! 

Did not the Rishi say, " Perchance 

Thou yet shalt see him, if so he will." 

Hope then, hope still 

For that last grace, 

Though hope be vain. 

Oh, what is it there that gleams ? 
What is it shimmering yonder between the trees ? 
The pearl-tree ! Krishna's pearl-tree ! Can it be ? 
Is it only the moon that rises, silvering Jumna's streams ? 
There upon either bank 
Is it a city I see 

In the moonshine glittering bright and white ? 
Domes and pinnacles height upon height, 
Palaces mounting rank beyond rank, 

150 



f R. C. Trevelyan 

Diamond-glimmering gates and towers, 
Sprung from the earth with sudden birth 
At some God's whim like magic flowers ! 
I will go nearer, down to the shores of the river. Oh, 
what may it be ? [Exit. 



SCENE VII 

A group of several APSARAS stands guarding the gates of a 
city, whose walls and pinnacles glitter in the moon 
light. 

Apsaras. 

LOVELY beyond all others and deledable 
To the hearts of the Gods are Vrinda's groves : 
For by day through their cool solitudes 
Frolicking with his playmates 

The divine herdsman wanders ; and there at nightfall 
His flute is heard ; 
And the melody winding afar down scented paths and 

floating 
Over the moon-filled branches, comes to the ears of the 

Gopis, 

And their hearts are stirred 
By a voice within them pleading : 
" Come, come now to the forest. Rise, delay not ! 
It is I, your Krishna, calls you. 

To the forest, to the forest, the moonlight and the dancing ! 
Follow where the flute is leading! " 
Then rising one by one from byre and household, 
They steal forth into the night, leaving kine unmilked, 
Cradles unrocked, fire and board un tended, 
With hearts bespelled 



C. Trevelyan 



Following Govinda's flute-notes through the woodways, 

To where beside Jumna's banks he stands ; 

And there on those moon-silvered sands 

The dance is knit, and hands meet hands ; 

And circling round with glancing feet 

That flit and fleet, they chant his praises ; 

And every maiden fondly deems 

'Tis none but he 

Who is dancing beside her knee to knee ; 

For to each and all alike it seems 

As though such bliss were hers alone, 

And no hand by his were held, 

No neck embraced, no lips thrilled 

By Krishna's, but her own. 

Ah brief delusion, as a dream's joy swift-winged ! 
Vain beguilement! Fleeting union of mortal nature 

with life divine ! 

The song ceases, the dance fails : 

As a moon-glance on the Jumna in splendour revealed, 
And anon quenched in cloud-veils, is the God for whom 

they pine. 

Then desolate and with grief distraught, 
Seeking and calling his name they wander 
Hither and thither among the trees. 
But of all most bitter is Radha's woe, 
Who loving most was most beloved, 
And in her heart's proud folly thought 
That she alone to the God was dear. 
But alas, at pride's lightest breath 
Bliss like a bubble vanisheth, 
Leaving anger's stubborn pain 
And grief that counterfeits disdain. 

152 



. C. Trevelyan 



But wisdom now in suffering's school 
Hath Radha learnt, poor love-sick fool. 
Be it Krishna's will that here 
May end her penance and despair ! 

Enter RADHA. 

Radha. Oh, it is strange yet 'tis no dream. 
The place I know, these banks, those trees, 
All still the same without a change : 
And there below flows Jumna's stream. 
But yonder marvellous palaces, 
Where yesterday was nought atall, 
This city glistening wall above wall, 
Towering through the moon's clear light 
Into the vastnesses of night- 
Can these be real ? Or has he 
Who from a pearl could raise a tree, 
Has he bidden it further by magic power 
To expand and unfurl and be changed in an hour 
Into a wonderful city of pearl ? 

Is yonder the gateway? Yes, it is there. 
Then will I enter straightway and seek within. 
With eyes no longer blind, purged of pride's sin, 
Perchance there shall I find by Krishna's grace 
His pearl- sown tree, and might that be, behold him 
face to face. 

But stay! Who are these 

So silent and so stern ? Beware ! 

Hide still 'mid the trees ! 

I dare not question them. 

The splendour of their beauty makes me afraid. 

I dare not. They would scorn one such as me. 



C. Trevelyan 



Yet I must perish if I find not Krishna. 
I will approach them. 

Gracious deities, 

Tell me, I pray you, tell me where is Krishna, 
Krishna, the son of Nanda and Yashoda ? 
Suffer me to enter, if he be within. 
First Apsara. Who may this be ? 
Second Afsara. It is some mad woman. 

Radha. I am Radha. I seek Krishna, my beloved. 
First Afsara. So, thou art Radha, the foolish cow-girl, 

she 

Who deemed in vanity of heart that Krishna 
Loved none but her ; yet when he begged one pearl, 
One small pearl from her neck, refused and mocked 

him. 

What, a vile thing such as thou intrude within 
These mansions of the Gods! Home to thy milk-pails! 
Radha. Drive me not away. Though Krishna scorn me 

still, 

And hide his countenance from me, yet perchance, 
Could I but find his pearl-tree. . . . Oh, forbid me not 
To enter and seek within, if it be there. 
Second Apsara. Ah, now we know what brings her here; 

not love 

Of Krishna, no, but greed for pearls, gay pearls 
To deck her robe and bosom, and so attract 
Some cowherd's wanton eyes to her poor charms. 
Third Apsara. 'Tis not for such as thou art to behold 
The heaven-born pearl-tree. Go then, drown thyself 
In thy despair. Yonder is the Jumna. Leap 
Within its waves ; and they shall carry thee 
Down to the sea. There shall thy craving soul 
Find pearls in plenty to content its greed. 
Radha. Ah, mock me; but have pity, and let me pass. 



. C. Trevelyan 



Fourth Apsara. Whither? There is no pearl-tree any 

more. 

By its own weight of fruitage overladen 
Its stem cracked and it fell ; and with the fruits 
Did Krishna build these palaces and towers, 
A paradise of pearl for their delight 
Whom most he loves. And therefore stand we here 
To guard these gates from covetous coquettes. 
Radha. Yet, I beseech you, open, and from the threshold 
Let me but look within. 
'Third Apsara. Away, shrill gnat ! 

Fifth Apsara. Sisters, let us be pitiful so far. 
If she be shown that where this pearl-tree stood 
There is none now, then will she be content 
To depart humbly as beseems a mortal. 
Radha. Yes, I will be content. But open quickly. 

[The APSARAS open the gates of the city. A 

street with a vista of shining buildings is 

revealed. 

Fifth Apsara. Behold ! What seest thou ? 
Radha. Nothing but light I see. 

The light of pearls is everywhere. The pearl-tree! 
It must come from the pearl- tree. Where, where is it ? 
Let me pass ! I must find it, or die here. 
Oh, do not stay me. 
First Apsara. Further to relent 

Were but a cruel kindness to thee, Radha. 
For know that like a fevered child's dreamland, 
Grown monstrous with enormity's despair, 
So infinite are those concentric mazes 
Which thou must travel inward, street on street, 
Gate beyond gate, city within city, 
Till old and feeble, after countless years, 
It may be thou shalt reach Vaikuntha's paradise, 



. C. Trevelyan 



Krishna's divine abode. There with dimmed eyes 
Thou mayst behold a pearl-tree ; or perchance 
Thou mayst not. Wilt thou venture, thus forewarned ? 
Radha. Yes, I must venture : I must follow still 
Where the light leads. See, palace beyond palace, 
Another and another without end, 
Brighter and vaster still they tower and dazzle ; 
Still would they lead me onward, like a moth 
Within a feasting chamber, to my doom. 
First Apsara. Then pass within. Foolhardy soul, fare 
well ! 

[RADHA steps through the gateway. At the 
same moment the city vanishes. She turns 
round in amazement ', to find that the wall 
and the APSARAS have vanished also. 
Radha. Ah! Darkness! 
The lights are vanished. 
There is no city. 

\_She turns back again: the pearl-tree stands 

before her. 

Oh wonder ! It is there ! 
Oh thou, my life's new light! 
Have I now found thee? Do I touch thee now? 
Vanish not as those mocking phantoms did. 
Ah cruelly, yet blessedly, they mocked me : 
For they through scorn have led me to this joy. 
See how the ground glimmers with fallen pearls ! 
Yet still the boughs with clustering thousands droop, 
Laden to overflowing, as my heart with bliss. 

But why do I feel this rapture? 
What else are they but only pearls and moonlight ? 
Why did I vex my soul for moonlit pearls ? 
Had I not pearls enough at home? Alas, 

156 



. C. Trevelyan 



How could I prove so miserly of my store, 

When 'twas my love that begged? Ah cruel Krishna! 

Is this thy vengeance? Hast thou lured me hither 

To mock me with the emblem of my shame ? 

Not for thy pearl-tree's splendour, but for the light 

Of thine eyes was I pining. Spurned by thee, 

Denied thy pardon, here must death find me. 

Below me is the ripple of the Jumna. 

Were it not best ? . . , Why, when the light is quenched, 

Not cast the lamp from me ? 

Krishna! Krishna! 

Lord of my soul ! Lord of the universe ! 

1 am but a poor foolish woman, frail, 
Ignorant, vile as dust. Have pity on me. 
Oh pardon me, my Lord : forsake me not, 
Weak, sinful, shameful, worthless though I be. 
I cannot live without thee. I die here. 

[She kneels, hiding her face in her hands. The 
pearl-tree fades, and KRISHNA is seen 
standing in its place. He steps to RADHA'S 
side and touches her arm. 

Krishna. Radhika, my soul's joy, my life's delight ! 
Where hast thou been all this long weary while ? 

[RAD HA prostrates herself and clasps his feet. 
KRISHNA raises her up and embraces her. 
Krishna. Come, Radhika, think not upon things past. 
Are they not vanished now like evil dreams? 
Young is the night yet; and in these lone woods 
We two are here alone. 

Nay, keep thy pearls. 
I need none ; for Love's pearl once more is mine. 

[He restores to her neck the necklace of pearls, 
which she has put into his hands.
