THE PASTURE 


I’m going out to clean the pasture spring; 

HI only stop to rake the leaves away 
(And wa t to watch the water clear, I may) 

I shan’t be gone long.— You come too. 

I’m going out to fetch the little calf 
That’s standing by the mother. It’s so young 
It totters when she licks it with her tongue. 

I shan’t be gone long.— You come too.

A 

BOY'S 

WILL 




INTO MY OWN 


One of my wishes is that those dark trees, 

So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze, 

Were not, as ’twere, the merest mask of gloom. 

But stretched away unto the edge of doom. 

I should not be withheld but that some day 
Into their vastness I should steal away, 

Fearless of ever finding open land, 

Or highway v/here the slow wheel pours the sand. 

I do not see why I should e’er turn back, 

Or those should not set forth upon my track 
To overtake me, who should miss me here 
And long to know if still I held them dear. 

They would not find me changed from him they knew— 
Only more sure of all I thought was true. 


[51 



GHOST HOUSE 


I dwell in a lonely house I know 
That vanished many a summer ago, 

And left no trace but the cellar walls, 

And a cellar in which the daylight falls, 

And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow. 

O’er ruined fences the grapevines shield 
The woods come back to the mowing field. 

The orchard tree has grown one copse 
Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops, 
The footpath down to the well is healed. 

I dwell with a strangely aching heart 
In that vanished abode there far apart 
On that disused and forgotten road 
That has no dust-bath now for the toad. 

Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart; 

The whippoorwill is coming to shout 
And hush and cluck and flutter about: 

I hear him begin far enough away 
Full many a time to say his say 
Before he arrives to say it out. 

It is under the small, dim, summer star. 

I know not who these mute folk are 
Who share the unlit place with me— 

Those stones out under the low-limbed tree 
Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar. 


[ 6 ] 



They are tireless folk, but slow and sad, 
Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,— 
With none among them that ever sings. 
And yet, in view of how many things, 

As sweet companions as might be had. 


[ 7 ] 



MY NOVEMBER GUEST 


My Sorrow, when she's here with me. 
Thinks these dark days of autumn rain 
Are beautiful as days can be; 

She loves the bare, the withered tree; 

She walks the sodden pasture lane. 

Her pleasure will not let me stay. 

She talks and I am fain to list: 

She’s glad the birds are gone away. 

She’s glad her simple worsted gray 
Is silver now with clinging mist. 

The desolate, deserted trees, 

The faded earth, the heavy sky. 

The beauties she so truly sees, 

She thinks I have no eye for these. 

And vexes me for reason why. 

Not yesterday I learned to know 
The love of bare November days 
Before the coming of the snow. 

But it were vain to tell her so. 

And they are better for her praise.

LOVE AND A QUESTION 


A Stranger came to the door at eve. 

And he spoke the bridegroom fair. 

He bore a green-white stick in his hand. 
And, for all burden, care. 

He asked with the eyes more than the lips 
For a shelter for die night. 

And he turned and looked at the road afar 
Without a window light. 

The bridegroom came forth into the porch 
With ‘Let us look at the sky. 

And question what of the night to be, 
Stranger, you and 1/ 

The woodbine leaves littered the yard. 

The woodbine berries were blue, 
Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind; 
‘Stranger, I wish I knew.’ 

Within, the bride in the dusk alone 
Bent over the open fire. 

Her face rose-red with the glowing coal 
And the thought of the heart’s desire. 
The bridegroom looked at the weary road. 
Yet saw but her within, 

And wished her heart in a case of gold 
And pinned with a silver pin. 

The bridegroom thought it little to give 
A dole of bread, a purse, 

A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God, 

Or for the rich a curse; 

19 ] 



But whether or not a man was asked 
To mar the love of two 
By harboring woe in the bridal house. 
The bridegroom wished he knew. 


[ 10 ] 



A LATE WALK 


When I go up through the mowing field. 
The headless aftermath, 

Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew. 
Half closes the garden path. 

And when I come to the garden ground, 

The whir of sober birds 
Up from the tangle of withered weeds 
Is sadder than any words. 

A tree beside the wall stands bare, 

But a leaf that lingered brown, 

Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought, 
Comes softly rattling down. 

I end not far from my going forth 
By picking the faded blue 
Of the last remaining aster flower 
To carry again to you. 


[ 11 ] 



STARS 


How countlessly they congregate 
O’er our tumultuous snow, 

Which flows in shapes as tall as trees 
When wintry winds do blow!— 

As if with keenness for our fate. 

Our faltering few steps on 
To white rest, and a place of rest 
Invisible at dawn,— 

And yet with neither love nor hate. 
Those stars like some snow-white 
Minerva’s snow-white marble eyes 
Without the gift of sight. 


[ 12 ] 



STORM FEAR 


When the wind works against us in the dark, 

And pelts with snow 

The lower chamber window on the east. 

And whispers with a sort of stifled bark, 

The beast, 

‘Come outl Come outl’— 

It costs no inward struggle not to go. 

Ah, nol 

I count our strength. 

Two and a child, 

Those of us not asleep subdued to mark 
How the cold creeps as the fire dies at length,— 
How drifts are piled, 

Dooryard and road ungraded, 

Till even the comforting bam grows far away. 
And my heart owns a doubt 
Whether ’tis in us to arise with day 
And save ourselves unaided. 


US] 



WIND AND WINDOW FLOWER 


Lovers, forget your love, 

And list to the love of these. 

She a window flower, 

And he a winter breeze. 

When the frosty window veil 
Was melted down at noon. 

And the caged yellow bird 
Hung over her in tune, 

He marked her through the pane 
He could not help but mark, 

And only passed her by, 

To come again at dark. 

He was a winter wind, 

Concerned with ice and snow. 

Dead weeds and unmated birds. 
And little of love could know. 

But he sighed upon the sill. 

He gave the sash a shake, 

As witness all within 
Who lay that night awake. 

Perchance he half prevailed 
To win her for the flight 

From the firelit looking-glass 
And warm stove-window light. 


[ 14 ] 



But the flower leaned aside 
And thought of naught to say. 
And morning found the breeze 
A hundred miles away. 


[ 15 ] 



TO THE THAWING WIND 


Come with rain, O loud Southwester! 
Bring the singer, bring the nester, 
Give the buried flower a dream; 

Make the settled snowbank steam; 
Find the brown beneath the white; 
But whate’er you do tonight, 

Bathe my window, make it flow. 
Melt it as the ice will go; 

Melt the glass and leave the sticks 
Like a hermit’s crucifix; 

Burst into my narrow stall, 

Swmg the picture on the wall; 

Run the rattling pages o’er; 

Scatter poems on the floor; 

Turn the poet out of door. 


[ 16 ] 



A PRAYER IN SPRING 


Oh, give us pleasure in the flowers today; 

And give us not to think so far away 
As the uncertain harvest; keep us here 
All simply in the springing of the year. 

Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white, 
Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night; 
And make us happy in the happy bees, 

The swarm dilating round the perfect trees. 

And make us happy in the darting bird 
That suddenly above the bees is heard, 

The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill. 
And off a blossom in mid air stands still. 

For this is love and nothing else is love, 

The which it is reserved for God above 
To sanctify to what far ends He will, 

But which it only needs that we fulfill. 


[ 17 ] 



FLOWER-GATHERING 


I left you in the morning. 

And in the morning glow. 

You walked a way beside me 
To make me sad to go. 

Do you know me in the gloaming, 

Gaunt and dusty gray with roaming? 

Are you dumb because you know me not. 
Or dumb because you know? 

All for me? And not a question 
For the faded flowers gay 
That could take me from beside you 
For the ages of a day? 

They are yours, and be the measure 
Of their worth for you to treasure. 

The measure of the little while 
That I’ve been long away. 


£ 18 ] 



ROSE POGONIAS 


A saturated meadow, 

Sun-shaped and jewel-small, 

A circle scarcely wider 
Than the trees around were tall; 
Where winds were quite excluded. 
And the air was stifling sweet 
With the breath of many flowers,— 

A temple of the heat. 

There we bowed us in the burning, 

As the sun’s right worship is, 

To pick where none could miss them 
A thousand orchises; 

For though the grass was scattered. 
Yet every second spear 
Seemed tipped with wings of color. 
That tinged the atmosphere. 

We raised a simple prayer 
Before we left the spot, 

That m the general mowing 
That place might be forgot; 

Or if not all so favored, 

Obtain such grace of hours. 

That none should mow the grass there 
While so confused with flowers. 


[ 19 ] 



WAITING 


AFIELD AT DUSK 

What things for dream there are when specter-like. 
Moving along tall haycocks lightly piled, 

I enter alone upon the stubble field, 

From which the laborers' voices late have died, 

And in the antiphony of afterglow 

And rising full moon, sit me down 

Upon the full moon’s side of the first haycock 

And lose myself amid so many alike. 

I dream upon the opposing lights of the hour. 
Preventing shadow until the moon prevail; 

I dream upon the nighthawks peopling heaven. 
Each circling each with vague unearthly cry. 

Or plunging headlong with fierce twang afar; 

And on the bats mute antics, who would seem 
Dimly to have made out my secret place, 

Only to lose it when he pirouettes, 

And seek it endlessly with purblind haste, 

On the last swallow’s sweep; and on the rasp 
In the abyss of odor and rustle at my back, 

That, silenced by my advent, finds once more, 

After an interval, his instrument, 

And tries once— twice— and thrice if I be there; 

And on the worn book of old-golden song 
I brought not here to read, it seems, but hold 
And freshen in this air of withering sweetness; 

But on the memory of one absent most, 

For whom these lines when they shall greet her eye. 


[ 20 ] 



IN A VALE 


When I was young, we dwelt in a vale 
By a misty fen that rang all night. 

And thus it was the maidens pale 
I knew so well, whose garments trail 
Across the reeds to a window light. 

The fen had every kind of bloom, 

And for every kind there was a face. 

And a voice that has sounded in my room 
Across the sill from the outer gloom. 

Each came singly unto her place, 

But all came every night with the mist, 

And often they brought so much to say 
Of things of moment to which, they wist, 

One so lonely was fain to list, 

That the stars were almost faded away 

Before the last went, heavy with dew, 

Back to the place from which she came— 

Where the bird was before it flew. 

Where the flower was before it grew. 

Where bird and flower were one and the same. 

And thus it is I know so well 
Why the flower has odor, the bird has song. 

You have only to ask me, and I can tell. 

No, not vainly there did I dwell, 

Nor vainly listen all the night long. 


[ 21 ] 



A DREAM PANG 


I had withdrawn in forest, and my song 
Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway; 

And to the forest edge you came one day 

(This was my dream) and looked and pondered long, 

But did not enter, though the wish was strong: 

You shook your pensive head as who should say, 

‘I dare not— too far in his footsteps stray— 

He must seek me would he undo the wrong/ 

Not far, but near, I stood and saw it all 
Behind low boughs the trees let down outside; 

And the sweet pang it cost me not to call 
And tell you that I saw does still abide. 

But ’tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof, 

For the wood wakes, and you are here for proof. 


[ 22 ] 



IN NEGLECT 


They leave us so to the way we took. 

As two in whom they were proved mistaken. 
That we sit sometimes in the wayside nook, 
With mischievous, vagrant, seraphic look, 

And try if we cannot feel forsaken. 


[ 23 ] 



THE VANTAGE POINT 


If tired of trees I seek again mankind, 

Well I know where to hie me— in the dawn. 
To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn. 
There amid lolling juniper reclined. 

Myself unseen, I see in white defined 
Far off the homes of men, and farther still, 
The graves of men on an opposing hill. 
Living or dead, whichever are to mind. 

And if by noon I have too much of these, 

I have but to turn on my arm, and lo, 

The sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow, 
My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, 

I smell the earth, I smell the bruised plant, 
I look into the crater of the ant. 


[ 24 ] 



MOWING 


There was never a sound beside the wood but one, 

And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground. 
What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself; 

Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun, 
Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound— 

And that was why it whispered and did not speak. 

It was no dream of the gift of idle hours, 

Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf: 

Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak 
To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows, 

Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers 
(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake. 

The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows. 

My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make. 


[ 25 ] 



'' GOING FOE WATER 


The well was dry beside the door, 

And so we went with pail and can 
Across the fields behind the house 
To seek the brook if still it ran; 

Not loth to have excuse to go, 

Because the autumn eve was fair 
(Though chill), because the fields were ours. 
And by the brook our woods were there. 

We ran as if to meet the moon 
That slowly dawned behind the trees. 

The barren boughs without the leaves, 
Without the birds, without the breeze. 

But once within the wood, we paused 
Like gnomes that hid us from the moon. 
Ready to run to hiding new 
With laughter when she found us soon. 

Each laid on other a staying hand 
To listen ere we dared to look, 

And in the hush we joined to make 
We heard, we knew we heard the brook. 

A note as from a single place, 

A slender tinkling fall that made 
Now drops that floated on the pool 
Like pearls, and now a silver blade. 


[ 26 ] 



REVELATION 


We make ourselves a place apart 

Behind light words that tease and flout. 
But oh, the agitated heart 
Till someone really find us out. 

’Tis pity if the case require 
(Or so we say) that in the end 
We speak the literal to inspire 
The understanding of a fnend. 

But so with all, from babes that play 
At hide-and-seek to God afar. 

So all who hide too well away 

Must speak and tell us where they are. 


[ 27 ] 



THE TRIAL BY EXISTENCE 


Even the bravest that are slain 
Shall not dissemble then- surprise 
On waking to find valor reign, 

Even as on earth, in paradise; 

And where they sought without the sword 
Wide fields of asphodel fore er. 

To find that the utmost reward 
Of daring should be still to dare. 

The light of heaven falls whole and white 
And is not shattered into dyes, 

The light forever is morning light; 

The hills are verdured pasture-wise; 

The angel hosts with freshness go, 

And seek with laughter what to brave;— 
And binding all is the hushed snow 
Of the far-distant breaking wave. 

And from a cliff-top is proclaimed 
The gathering of the souls for birth. 

The trial by existence named, 

The obscuration upon earth. 

And the slant spirits trooping by 
In streams and cross- and counter-streams 
Can but give ear to that sweet cry 
For its suggestion of what dreams! 

And the more loitering are turned 
To view once more the sacrifice 
Of those who for some good discerned 
Will gladly give up paradise. 

[ 28 ] 



And a white shimmering concourse rolls 
Toward the throne to witness there 
The speeding of devoted souls 

Which God makes his especial care. 

And none are taken but who will. 

Having first heard the life read out 
That opens earthward, good and ill. 
Beyond the shadow of a doubt; 

And very beautifully God limns, 

And tenderly, life’s little dream. 

But naught extenuates or dims, 

Setting the thing that is supreme. 

Nor is there wanting in the press 
Some spirit to stand simply forth. 

Heroic in its nakedness, 

Against the uttermost of earth. 

The tale of earth’s unhonored things 

Sounds nobler there than ’neath the sun; 
And the mind whirls and the heart sings. 
And a shout greets the daring one. 

But always God speaks at the end: 

‘One thought in agony of strife 
The bravest would have by for friend. 

The memory that he chose the life; 

But the pure fate to which you go 
Admits no memory of choice. 

Or the woe were not earthly woe 

To which you give the assenting voice.’ 

And so the choice must be again. 

But the last choice is still the same; 

[ 29 ] 



And the awe passes wonder then, 

And a hush falls for all acclaim. 

And God has taken a flower of gold 
And broken it, and used therefrom 
The mystic link to bind and hold 
Spirit to matter till death come. 

’Tis of the essence of life here, 

Though we choose greatly, still to lack 
The lasting memory at all clear. 

That life has for us on the wrack 
Nothing but what we somehow chose; 

Thus are we wholly stripped of pride 
In the pain that has but one close, 
Bearing it crushed and mystified. 


[ 30 ] 



THE TUFT OF FLOWERS 


I went to turn the grass once after one 
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun. 

The dew was gone that made his blade so keen 
Before I came to view the leveled scene. 

I looked for him behind an isle of trees, 

I listened for his whetstone on the breeze. 

But he had gone his way, the grass all mown. 

And I must be, as he had been,— alone, 

‘As all must be,’ I said within my heart, 

‘Whether they work together or apart.’ 

But as I said it, swift there passed me by 
On noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly, 

Seeking with memories grown dim o’er night 
Some resting flower of yesterday’s delight. 

And once I marked his flight go round and round. 
As where some flower lay withering on the ground. 

And then he flew as far as eye could see, 

And then on tremulous wing came back to me. 

I thought of questions that have no reply, 

And would have turned to toss the grass to dry; 


[ 31 ] 



But he turned first, and led my eye to look 
At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook, 

A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared 
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared. 

The mower in the dew had loved them thus. 

By leaving them to flourish, not for us. 

Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him, 

But from sheer morning gladness at the brim. 

The butterfly and I had lit upon, 

Nevertheless, a message from the dawn. 

That made me hear the wakening birds around, 
And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground, 

And feel a spirit kindred to my own; 

So that henceforth I worked no more alone; 

But glad with him, I worked as with his aid. 

And weary, sought at noon with him the shade; 

And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech 
With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach, 

‘Men work together/ 1 told him from the heart, 
“Whether they work together or apart/ 


[ 32 ] 



PAN WITH US 


Pan came out of the woods one day,— 

His skin and his hair and his eyes were gray, 
The gray of the moss of walls were they,— 
And stood in the sun and looked his fill 
At wooded valley and wooded hill. 

He stood in the zephyr, pipes in hand. 

On a height of naked pasture land; 

In all the country he did command 
He saw no smoke and he saw no roof. 

That was well! and he stamped a hoof. 

His heart knew peace, for none came here 
To this lean feeding save once a year 
Someone to salt the half-wild steer, 

Or homespun children with clicking pails 
Who see so little they tell no tales. 

He tossed his pipes, too hard to teach 
A new-world song, far out of reach. 

For a sylvan sign that the blue jay’s screech 
And the whimper of hawks beside the sun 
Were music enough for him, for one. 

Times were changed from what they were: 
Such pipes kept less of power to stir 
The fruited bough of the juniper 

And the fragile bluets clustered there 
Than the merest aimless breath of air. 


£ 33 ] 



They were pipes of pagan mirth, 

And the world had found new terms of worth. 
He laid him down on the sun-burned earth 
And raveled a flower and looked away— 
Play? Play?— What should he play? 


[ 34 ] 



THE DEMIURGE’S LAUGH 


It was far in the sameness of the wood; 

I was running with joy on the Demon s trail. 
Though I knew what I hunted was no true god. 

It was just as the light was beginning to fail 
That I suddenly heard— all I needed to hear: 

It has lasted me many and many a year. 

The sound was behind me instead of before, 

A sleepy sound, but mocking half. 

As of one who utterly couldn’t care. 

The Demon arose from his wallow to laugh. 
Brushing the dirt from his eye as he went; 

And well I knew what the Demon meant 

I shall not forget how his laugh rang out. 

I felt as a fool to have been so caught, 

And checked my steps to make pretense 
It was something among the leaves I sought 
(Though doubtful whether he stayed to see). 
Thereafter I sat me against a tree. 


[ 35 ] 



NOW CLOSE THE WINDOWS 


Now close the windows and hush all the fields: 

If the trees must, let them silently toss; 

No bird is singing now, and if there is, 

Be it my loss. 

It will be long ere the marshes resume, 

It will be long ere the earliest bird: 

So close the windows and not hear the wind. 
But see all wind-stirred. 


[ 36 ] 



IN HARDWOOD GROVES 


The same leaves over and over a gain I 
They fall from giving shade above 
To make one texture of faded brown 
And fit the earth like a leather glove. 

Before the leaves can mount again 
To fill the trees with another shade, 

They must go down past things coming up. 
They must go down into the dark decayed. 

They must be pierced by flowers and put 
Beneath the feet of dancing flowers. 
However it is in some other world 
I know that this is the way in ours. 


[ 37 ] 



A LINE-STORM SONG 


The Ime-storm clouds fly tattered and sv ^t. 
The road is forlorn all day, 

Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lilt. 
And the hoof-prints vanish away. 

The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee. 
Expend their bloom in vain. 

Come over the hills and far with me, 

And be my love in the rain. 

The birds have less to say for themselves 
In the wood-world’s tom despair 

Than now these numberless years the elves. 
Although they are no less there. 

All song of the woods is crushed like some 
Wild, easily shattered rose. 

Come, be my love in the wet woods, come. 
Where the boughs rain when it blows. 

There is the gale to urge behind 
And bruit our singing down, 

And the shallow waters aflutter with wind 
From which to gather your gown. 

What matter if we go clear to the west, 

And come not through dry-shod? 

For wilding brooch shall wet your breast 
The rain-fresh goldenrod. 

Oh, never this whelming east wind swells 
But it seems like the sea’s return 

To the ancient lands where it left the shells 
Before the age of the fem; 

[ 38 ] 



Ynd it seems like the time when after doubt 
Our love came back amain 
Oh, come forth into the storm and rout 
And be my love in the rain. 


[391 



OCTOBER 


O hushed October morning mild. 

Thy leaves have ripened to the fall; 
Tomorrow’s wind, if it be wild, 

Should waste them all. 

The crows above the forest call; 
Tomorrow they may form and go. 

O hushed October morning mild, 

Begin the hours of this day slow. 

Make the day seem to us less brief. 

Hearts not averse to being beguiled, 
Beguile us in the way you know. 

Release one leaf at break of day; 

At noon release another leaf; 

One from our trees, one far away. 

Retard the sun with gentle mist; 

Enchant the land with amethyst. 

Slow, slowl 

For the grapes’ sake, if they were all, 
Whose leaves already are burnt with frost, 
Whose clustered fruit must else be lost— 
For the grapes’ sake along the wall. 


[ 40 ] 



MY BUTTERFLY 


Thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too, 

And the daft sun-assaulter, he 

That frighted thee so oft, is fled or dead: 

Save only me 
(Nor is it sad to thee!) 

Save only me 

There is none left to mourn thee in the fields. 

The gray grass is scarce dappled with the snow; 

Its two banks have not shut upon the river; 

But it is long ago— 

It seems forever— 

Since first I saw thee glance, 

With all thy dazzling other ones, 

In airy dalliance, 

Precipitate in love, 

Tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above, 

Like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance. 

When that was, the soft mist 

Of my regret hung not on all the land, 

And I was glad for thee. 

And glad for me, I wist. 

Thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high, 
That fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind, 
With those great careless wings, 

Nor yet did I. 

And there were other things: 

It seemed God let thee flutter from his gentle clasp: 

[ 41 ] 



Then fearful he had let thee win 
Too far beyond him to be gathered in, 
Snatched thee, o’ereager, with ungentle grasp. 

Ahl I remember me 

How once conspiracy was rife 

Against my life— 

The languor of it and the dreaming fond; 
Surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought. 
The breeze three odors brought. 

And a gem-flower waved in a wand! 

Then when I was distraught 
And could not speak, 

Sidelong, full on my cheek, 

What should that reckless zephyr fling 
But the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing! 

I found that wing broken today! 

For thou art dead, I said, 

And the strange birds say. 

I found it with the withered leaves 
Under the eaves. 



RELUCTANCE 


Out through the fields and the woods 
And over the walls I have wended; 

I have climbed the hills of view 
And looked at the world, and descended, 
I have come by the highway home. 

And lo, it is ended. 

The leaves are all dead on the ground, 
Save those that the oak is keeping 
To ravel them one by one 

And let them go scraping and creeping 
Out over the crusted snow, 

When others are sleeping. 

And the dead leaves lie huddled and still, 
No longer blown hither and thither; 

The last lone aster is gone; 

The flowers of the witch-hazel wither; 
The heart is still aching to seek, 

But the feet question 'Whither?’ 

Ah, when to the heart of man 
Was it ever less than a treason 
To go with the drift of things, 

To yield with a grace to reason. 

And bow and accept the end 
Of a love or a season?

MENDING WALL 


Something there is that doesn’t love a wall, 

That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, 

And spills the upper boulders in the sun; 

And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. 

The work of hunters is another thing: 

I have come after them and made repair 
Where they have left not one stone on a stone, 

But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, 

To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, 

No one has seen them made or heard them made, 
But at spring mending-time we find them there. 

I let my neighbor know beyond the hill; 

And on a day we meet to walk the lme 
And set the wall between us once again. 

We keep the wall between us as we go. 

To each the boulders that have fallen to each. 

And some are loaves and some so nearly balls 
We have to use a spell to make them balance: 
‘Stay where you are until our backs are turned!’ 
We wear our fingers rough with handling them. 
Oh, just another kind of outdoor game. 

One on a side. It comes to little more: 

There where it is we do not need the wall: 

He is all pine and I am apple orchard. 

My apple trees will never get across 
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him 
He only says, ‘Good fences make good neighbors.’ 
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder 
If I could put a notion in his head: 

‘Why do they make good neighbors? Isn’t it 
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows 

[ 47 ] 



Before I built a wall I’d ask to know 
What I was walling in or walling out. 

And to whom I was like to give offense. 

Something there is that doesn’t love a wall, 

That wants it down.’ I could say ‘Elves’ to him. 
But it’s not elves exactly, and I’d rather 
He said it for himself. I see him there 
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top 
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed. 

He moves in darkness as it seems to me, 

Not of woods only and the shade of trees 
He will not go behind his father’s saying, 

And he likes having thought of it so well 

He says again, ‘Good fences make good neighbors.’ 


[ 48 ] 



THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN 


Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table 
Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step, 

She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage 
To meet him in the doorway with the news 
And put him on his guard. ‘Silas is back.’ 

She pushed him outward with her through the door 
And shut it after her. ‘Be kind,’ she said. 

She took the market things from Warren’s arms 
And set them on the porch, then drew him down 
To sit beside her on the wooden steps. 

When was I ever anything but kind to him ? 

But I’ll not have the fellow back,’ he said. 

‘I told him so last haying, didn’t I? 

If he left then, I said, that ended it. 

What good is he? Who else will harbor him 
At his age for the little he can do? 

What help he is there’s no depending on. 

Off he goes always when I need him most. 

He thinks he ought to earn a little pay, 

Enough at least to buy tobacco with. 

So he won’t have to beg and be beholden. 

“All right,” I say, “I can’t afford to pay 
Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.” 

“Someone else can.” "Then someone else will have to.” 
I shouldn’t mind his bettering himself 
If that was what it was. You can be certain, 

When he begins like that, there’s someone at him 
Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,— 

In haying time, when any help is scarce. 

In "winter he comes back to us. I’m done.’ 

[ 49 ] 




■asami 

‘Sh! not so loud: he’ll hear you,’ Mary said. 

1 want him to: he’ll have to soon or late.’ 

‘He’s worn out. He’s asleep beside the stove. 

When I came up from Rowe’s I found him here, 

Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep, 

A miserable sight, and frightening, too- 
You needn’t smile— I didn’t recognize him— 

I wasn’t looking for him-and he’s changed. 

Wait till you see.’ 

‘Where did you say he’d been?’ 

‘He didn’t say. I dragged him to the house, 

And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke. 

I tried to make him talk about his travels. 

Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.’ 

‘What did he say? Did he say anything?’ 

‘But little.’ 

‘Anything? Mary, confess 
He said he’d come to ditch the meadow for me.’ 

' ' - I . .* 1 f 

“Warren!’ 

‘But did he? I just want to know.’ 

‘Of course he did. What would you have him say? 

Surely you wouldn’t grudge the poor old man 
Some humble way to save his self-respect. 

He added, if you really care to know, 

inns. t 5 °i 



He meant to clear the upper pasture, too. 

That sounds like something you have heard before? 
Warren, I wish you could have heard the way 
He jumbled everything. I stopped to look ■ 

Two or three times-he made me feel so queer- 
To see if he was talking in his sleep. 

He ran on Harold Wilson— you remember— 

The boy you had in haying four years since. 

He’s finished school, and teaching in his college- 
Silas declares you’ll have to get him back. 

He says they two will make a team for work: 

Between them they will lay this farm as smooth! 

The way he mixed that in with other thin gs. 

He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft 
On education— you know how they fought 
All through July under the blazing sun, 

Silas up on the cart to build the load, 

Harold along beside to pitch it on.’ 

'Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.’ 

‘Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream. 

You wouldn’t think they would. How some things Imgerf 
Harold’s young college boy’s assurance piqued him. 
After so many years he still keeps finding 
Good arguments he sees he might have used. 

I sympathize. I know just how it feels 
To think of the right thing to say too late. 

Harold’s associated in his mind with Latin. 

He asked me what I thought of Harold’s saying 
He studied Latin like the violin 
Because he liked it— that an argument! 

He said he couldn’t make the boy believe 

[ 51 ] 



He could find water with a hazel prong— 

Which showed how much good school had ever done hire . 
He wanted to go over that. But most of all 
He thinks if he could have another chance 
To teach him how to build a load of hay—’ 

‘I know, that’s Silas’ one accomplishment. 

He bundles every forkful in its place. 

And tags and numbers it for future reference. 

So he can find and easily dislodge it 
In the unloading. Silas does that well. 

He takes it out in bunches like big birds’ nests. 

You never see him standing on the hay 
He’s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.’ 

He t h i n ks if he could teach him that, he’d be 
Some good perhaps to someone in the world. 

He hates to see a boy the fool of books. 

Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk. 

And nothing to look backward to with pride, 

And nothing to look forward to with hope, 

So now and never any different.’ 

Part of a moon was falling down the west. 

Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills. 

Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw it 
And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand 
Among the harp-like morning-glory strings, 

Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves. 

As if she played unheard some tenderness 
That wrought on him beside her in the night. 

‘Warren, she said, lie has come home to die: 

You needn t be afraid he’ll leave you this time.’ 

[ 52 ] 



‘Home/ he mocked gently. 


“Yes, what else but home? 
It all depends on what you mean by home. 

Of course he’s nothing to us, any more 
Than was the hound that came a stranger to us 
Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail,’ 

Home is the place where, when you have to go there, 
They have to take you in/ 


1 should have called it 
Something you somehow haven’t to deserve/ 

Warren leaned out and took a step or two, 

Picked up a little stick, and brought it back 
And broke it in his hand and tossed it by. 

‘Silas has better claim on us you think 
Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles 
As the road winds would bring him to his door. 
Silas has walked that far no doubt today. 

Why doesn’t he go there? His brother’s rich, 

A somebody— director in the bank/ 

‘He never told us that/ 


We know it though/ 

T think his brother ought to help, of course. 

I’ll see to that if there is need. He ought of right 
To take him in, and might be willing to— 

He may be better than appearances. 

But have some pity on Silas. Do you think 

[ 53 ] 



If he had any pride m claiming kin 
Or anything he looked for from his brother. 
He’d keep so still about him all this time?’ 

1 wonder what’s between them.’ 


‘I can tell you. 

Silas is what he is— we wouldn’t mind him— 

But just the kind that kinsfolk can’t abide. 

He never did a thing so very bad. 

He don’t know why he isn’t quite as good 
As anybody. Worthless though he is, 

He won’t be made ashamed to please his brother ’ 

7 can’t think Si ever hurt anyone.’ 

‘No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay 

And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back. 

He wouldn’t let me put him on the lounge. 

You must go in and see what you can do. 

I made the bed up for him there tonight. 

You’ll be surprised at him— how much he’s broken. 

His working days are done; I'm sure of it.’ 

Yd not be in a hurry to say that.’ 

‘I haven’t been. Go, look, see for yourself. 

But, Warren, please remember how it is: 

He’s come to help you ditch the meadow. 

He has a plan. You mustn’t laugh at him. 

He may not speak of it, and then he may. 

Til sit and see if that small sailing cloud 
Will hit or miss the moon/ 

[ 54 ] 



It hit the moon. 

Then there were three there, making a dim row, 

The moon, the little silver cloud, and she. 

Warren returned— too soon, it seemed to her, 

Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited. 

"Warren?’ she questioned. 

‘Dead,’ was all he answered. 


[ 55 ] 



THE MOUNTAIN 


The mountain held the town as in a shadow. 

I saw so much before I slept there once: 

I noticed that I missed stars in the west, 

Where its black body cut into the sky. 

Near me it seemed: I felt it like a wall 
Behind which I was sheltered from a wind. 

And yet between the town and it I found, 

When I walked forth at dawn to see new things, 
Were fields, a river, and beyond, more fields. 

The river at the time was fallen away, 

And made a widespread brawl on cobblestones; 
But the signs showed what it had done in spring: 
Good grassland gullied out, and in the grass 
Bidges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark. 

I crossed the river and swung round the mountain. 
And there I met a man who moved so slow 
With white-faced oxen in a heavy cart. 

It seemed no harm to stop him altogether. 

'What town is this?' I asked. 


‘This? Lunenburg.’ 

Then I was wrong: the town of my sojourn, 
Beyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain, 
But only felt at night its shadowy presence. 
‘Where is your village? Very far from here?' 

There is no village— only scattered farms. 

We were but sixty voters last election. 

We can’t in nature grow to manv more: 

[ 56 ] 



That thing takes all the room!’ He moved his goad. 
The mountain stood there to be pointed at. 

Pasture ran up the side a little way, 

And then there was a wall of trees with trunks; 
After that only tops of trees, and cliffs 
Imperfectly concealed among the leaves. 

A dry ravine emerged from under boughs 
Into the pasture. 

‘That looks like a path. 

Is that the way to reach the top from here?— 

Not for this morning, but some other time: 

I must be getting back to breakfast now.’ 

‘I don’t advise your trying from this side. 

There is no proper path, but those that have 
Been up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd’s. 
That’s five miles back. You can’t mistake the place: 
They logged it there last winter some way up. 

I’d take you, but I’m bound the other way.’ 

'You’ve never climbed it?’ 


Tve been on the sides, 

Deer-hunting and trout-fishing. There’s a brook 
That starts up on it somewhere— I’ve heard say 
Right on the top, tip-top— a curious thing. 

But what would interest you about the brook. 

It’s always cold in summer, warm in winter. 

One of the great sights going is to see 
It steam in winter like an ox’s breath. 

Until the bushes all along its banks 

Are inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles— 

You know the kind. Then let the sun shine on it!’ 

[ 57 ] 



There ought to be a view around the world 
From such a mountain— if it isn’t wooded 
Clear to the top.' I saw through leafy screens 
Great granite terraces in sun and shadow. 
Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up— 
With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet 
Or turn and sit on and look out and down. 
With little ferns in crevices at his elbow. 

‘As to that I can’t say. But there’s the spring. 
Right on the summit, almost like a fountain. 
That ought to be worth seeing.’ 


You never saw it?’ 


‘If it’s there 


‘I guess there’s no doubt 
About its being there. I never saw it. 

It may not be right on the very top : 

It wouldn’t have to be a long way down 
To have some head of water from above. 

And a good distance down might not be noticed 
By anyone who’d come a long way up. 

One time I asked a fellow climbing it 
To look and tell me later how it was.’ 

What did he say?’ 


'He said there was a lake 
Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top.' 

'Em a lake’s different. What about the spring?’ 

158 ] 



‘He never got up high enough to see. 

That's why I don’t advise your trying this side. 

He tried this side. I’ve always meant to go 
And look myself, but you know how it is: 

It doesn’t seem so much to climb a mountain 
You’ve worked around the foot of all your life. 

What would I do? Go in my overalls, 

With a big stick, the same as when the cows 
Haven’t come down to the bars at milking time? 

Or with a shotgun for a stray black bear? 
’Twouldn’t seem real to climb for climbing it’ 

T shouldn’t climb it if I didn’t want to— 

Not for the sake of climbing. What’s its name?’ 

*We call it Hor: I don’t know if that’s right.’ 

‘Can one walk around it? Would it be too far?’ 

*You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg, 

But it’s as much as ever you can do. 

The boundary lines keep in so close to it. 

Hor is the township, and the township’s Hor— 

And a few houses sprinkled round the foot. 

Like boulders broken off the upper cliff. 

Rolled out a little farther than the rest.’ 

‘Warm in December, cold in June, you say?’ 

T don’t suppose the water’s changed at all. 

You and I know enough to know it’s warm 
Compared with cold, and cold compared with warm 
But all the fun’s in how you say a thing.’ 

[ 59 ] 



‘You’ve lived here all your life?’ 


‘Ever since Hor 

Was no bigger than a—’ What, I did not hear. 

He drew the oxen toward him with light touches 
Of his slim goad on nose and offside flank, 

Gave them their marching orders and was moving. 


[ 60 ] 



A HUNDRED COLLARS 


Lancaster bore him— such a little town. 

Such a great man. It doesn’t see him often 
Of late years, though he keeps the old homestead 
And sends the children down there with their mother 
To run wild in the summer— a little wild. 

Sometimes he joins them for a day or two 
And sees old friends he somehow can’t get near. 
They meet him in the general store at night. 
Preoccupied -with formidable mail. 

Rifling a printed letter as he talks. 

They seem afraid. He wouldn’t have it so: 

Though a great scholar, he’s a democrat. 

If not at heart, at least on principle. 

Lately when coming up to Lancaster, 

His train being late, he missed another tr ain 
And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction 
After eleven o’clock at night. Too tired 
To think of sitting such an ordeal out. 

He turned to the hotel to find a bed. 

‘No room,’ the night clerk said. ‘Unless— 

Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps 
And cars that shock and rattle— and one hotel. 

*You say “unless.” ’ 


‘Unless you wouldn’t mind 
Sharing a room with someone else.’ 


[ 61 ] 


‘Who is it? 



'A man; 


‘So I should hope. What kind of man?’ 

1 know him: he’s all right. A mans a man. 
Separate beds, of course, you understand.’ 

The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on. 

‘Who’s that man sleeping in the office chair? 

Has he had the refusal of my chance?’ 

‘He was afraid of being robbed or murdered. 
What do you say?’ 


TU have to have a bed.’ 

The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs 
And down a narrow passage full of doors, 

At the last one of which he knocked and entered. 
‘Lafe, here’s a fellow wants to share your room.’ 

‘Show him this way. I’m not afraid of him. 

I’m not so drunk I can’t take care of myself.’ 

The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot. 
‘This will be yours. Good-night,’ he said, and went. 

‘Lafe was the name, I think?’ 


‘Yes, Layfayette. 

You got it the first time. And yours?’ 


‘Magoon. 


Doctor Magoon.’ 


[ 62 ] 



‘A Doctor?’ 


"Well, a teacher.’ 

‘Professor Square-the-circle-till-you’re-tired? 

Hold on, there’s something I don’t think of now 
That I had on my mind to ask the first 
Man that knew anything I happened in with. 

I’ll ask you later— don’t let me forget it.’ 

The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away. 

A man? A brute. Naked above the waist, 

He sat there creased and shining in the light. 
Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt. 
'I’m moving into a size-larger shirt. 

I’ve felt mean lately; mean’s no name for it. 

I just found what the matter was tonight: 

I’ve been a-choking like a nursery tree 
When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag. 

I blamed it on the hot spell we’ve been having. 
’Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back. 

Not liking to own up I’d grown a size. 

Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?’ 

The Doctor caught his throat convulsively. 

‘Oh— ah— fourteen— fourteen.’ 


‘Fourteen I You say so! 
I can remember when I wore fourteen. 

And come to think I must have back at home 
More than a hundred collars, size fourteen. 

Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them. 


[ 63 ] 



They’re yours and welcome; let me send them to you. 
What makes you stand there on one leg like that? 
You’re not much furtherer than where Kike left you. 
You act as if you wished you hadn’t come. 

Sit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous.’ 

The Doctor made a subdued dash for it, 

And propped himself at bay against a pillow. 

“Not that way, with your shoes on Kike’s white bed. 
You can’t rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off.’ 

‘Don’t touch me, please— I say, don’t touch me, please. 
I’ll not be put to bed by you, my man.’ 

‘Just as you say. Have it your own way then. 

“My man” is it? You talk like a professor. 

Speaking of who’s afraid of who, however, 

I’m thinking I have more to lose than you 
If anything should happen to be wrong. 

Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat! 

Let’s have a showdown as an evidence 
Of good faith. There is ninety dollars. 

Come, if you’re not afraid.’ 


‘Z’m not afraid. 

There’s five: that’s all I carry.’ 


‘I can search you? 

Where are you moving over to? Stay still. 
You’d better tuck your money under you 
And sleep on it the way I always do 
When I’m with people I don’t trust at night.’ 
[ 64 ] 



“Will you believe me if I put it there 

Right on the counterpane— that I do trust you?’ 


'You’d say so, Mister Man.— I’m a collector. 

My ninety isn’t mine— you won’t think that. 

I pick it up a dollar at a time 

All round the country for the Weekly News, 

Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News F 

“Known it since I was young.’ 


'Then you know me. 

Now we are getting on together— talking. 

I'm sort of Something for it at the front. 

My business is to find what people want: 

They pay for it, and so they ought to have it 
Fairbanks, he says to me— he’s editor— 

“Feel out the public sentiment”— he says. 

A good deal comes on me when all is said. 

The only trouble is we disagree 
In politics: I’m Vermont Democrat— 

You know what that is, sort of double-dyed; 

The News has always been Republican. 

Fairbanks, he says to me, “Help us this year,” 
Meaning by us their ticket. “No,” I says, 

“I can’t and won’t. You’ve been in long enough: 

It’s time you turned around and boosted us. 

You’ll have to pay me more than ten a week 
If I’m expected to elect Bill Taft. 

I doubt if I could do it anyway.” ’ 

“You seem to shape the paper’s policy.’ 


[ 65 ] 



“You see I’m in with everybody, know ’em all. 

I almost know their farms as well as they do. 

‘You drive around? It must be pleasant work.’ 

‘It’s business, but I can’t say it’s not fun. 

What I like best’s the lay of different farms. 

Coming out on them from a stretch of woods. 

Or over a hill or round a sudden corner. 

I like to find folks getting out in spring, 

Raking the dooryard, working near the house. 

Later they get out further in the fields. 

Everything’s shut sometimes except the bam; 

The family’s all away in some back meadow. 

There’s a hay load a-coming— when it comes. 

And later still they all get driven in: 

The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches 
Stripped to bare ground, the maple trees 
To whips and poles. There’s nobody about. 

The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking. 
And I he back and ride. I take the reins 
Only when someone’s coming, and the mare 
Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go. 

I’ve spoiled Jemima in more ways than one. 

She’s got so she turns in at every house 
As if she had some sort of curvature, 

No matter if I have no errand there. 

She thinks I’m sociable. I maybe am. 

It’s seldom I get down except for meals, though. 
Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep, 

All in a family row down to the youngest.’ 

‘One would suppose they might not be as glad 
To see you as you are to see them.’ 

[ 66 ] 



‘Oh, 

Because I want their dollar? I don’t want 
Anything they’ve not got. I never dun. 

I’m there, and they can pay me if they like. 
I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by. 
Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink. 

I drink out of the bottle— not your style. 
Mayn’t I offer you—?’ 


‘No, no no, thank you.’ 

‘Just as you say. Here’s looking at you then.— 

And now I’m leaving you a little while. 

You’ll rest easier when I’m gone, perhaps— 

Lie down— let yourself go and get some sleep. 

But first— let’s see— what was I going to ask you? 
Those collars— who shall I address them to. 
Suppose you aren’t awake when I come back?’ 

‘Really, friend, I can’t let you. You— may need them.’ 

“Not till I shrink, when they’ll be out of style.’ 

‘But really I— I have so many collars.’ 

‘I don’t know who I rather would have have them. 
They’re only turning yellow where they are. 

But you’re the doctor as the saying is. 

I’ll put the light out. Don’t you wait for me: 

I’ve just begun the night. You get some sleep. 

Ill knock so-fashion and peep round the door 
When I come back so you’ll know who it is. 

There’s nothing I’m afraid of like scared people. 

I don’t want you should shoot me in the head. 

[6 7 ] 



What am I doing carrying off this bottle? 

There now, you get some sleep/ 

He shut the door. 

The Doctor slid a little down the pillow. 


[ 68 ] 



HOME BURIAL 


He saw her from the bottom of the stairs 
Before she saw him. She was starting down, 
Looking back over her shoulder at some fear. 
She took a doubtful step and then undid it 
To raise herself and look agam. He spoke 
Advancing toward her. ‘What is it you see 
From up there always— for I want to know.’ 

She turned and sank upon her skirts at that, 

And her face changed from terrified to dull. 

He said to gain time: What is it you see,’ 
Mounting until she cowered under him. 

‘I will find out now— you must tell me, dear.’ 

She, in her place, refused him any help 
With the least stiffening of her neck and silence. 
She let him look, sure that he wouldn’t see, 
Blind creature; and awhile he didn’t see. 

But at last he murmured, ‘Oh,’ and again, ‘Oh.’ 

What is it— what?’ she said. 


‘Just that I see.’ 

‘You don’t/ she challenged. ‘Tell me what it is.’ 

The wonder is I didn’t see at once. 

I never noticed it from here before. 

I must be wonted to it— that’s the reason. 

The little graveyard where my people are! 

So small the window frames the whole of it. 

Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it? 

There are three stones of slate and one of marble, 

[ 69 ] 



Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunhght 
On the sidehill. We haven’t to mind those. 

But I understand, it is not the stones, 

But the child’s mound— 

‘Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t/ she cried. 

She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm 
That rested on the bannister, and slid downstairs, 
And turned on him with such a daunting look, 

He said twice over before he knew himself: 

‘Can’t a man speak of his own child he’s lost?’ 

‘Not you! Oh, where’s my hat? Oh, I don’t need it! 
I must get out of here. I must get air. 

I don’t know rightly whether any man can.’ 

‘Amy! Don’t go to someone else this time. 

Listen to me. I won’t come down the stairs.’ 

He sat and fixed his chin between his fists. 

‘There’s something I should like to ask you, dear/ 

‘You don’t know how to ask it.’ 


‘Help me, then.’ 

Her fingers moved the latch for all reply. 

‘My words are nearly always an ofiFense. 

I don’t know how to speak of anything 
So as to please you. But I might be taught 
I should suppose. I can’t say I see how. 

A man must partly give up being a man 
With women-folk. We could have some arrangement 
[ 70 ] 



By which I’d bind myself to keep hands off 
Anything special you’re a-mind to name. 

Though I don’t like such things ’twixt those that love. 
Two that don’t love can’t live together without them. 
But two that do can’t live together with them.’ 

She moved the latch a little. ‘Don’t— don’t go. 

Don’t carry it to someone else this time. 

Tell me about it if it’s something human. 

Let me into your grief. I’m not so much 
Unlike other folks as your standing there 
Apart would make me out. Give me my chance. 

I do think, though, you overdo it a little. 

What was it brought you up to think it the thing 
To take your mother-loss of a first child 
So inconsolably— in the face of love. 

You'd think his memory might be satisfied—’ 

"There you go sneering now!’ 


‘I’m not. I’m not! 

You make me angry. I’ll come down to you. 

God, what a woman! And its come to this, 

A man can’t speak of his own child that’s dead.’ 

“You can’t because you don’t know how to speak. 

If you had any feelings, you that dug 

With your own hand— how could you?— his little grave; 

I saw you from that very window there, 

Making the gravel leap and leap in air, 

Leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly 
And roll back down the mound beside the hole. 

I thought. Who is that man? I didn’t know you. 

And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs 

[ 71 ] 



To look again, and still your spade kept lifting. 
Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice 
Out in the kitchen, and I don’t know why, 

But I went near to see with my own eyes. 

You could sit there with the stains on your shoes 
Of the fresh earth from your own baby’s grave 
And talk about your everyday concerns. 

You had stood the spade up against the wall 
Outside there in the entry, for I saw it.’ 

1 shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed. 

I’m cursed. God, if I don’t believe I’m cursed.’ 

T can repeat the very words you were saying. 
“Three foggy mornings and one rainy day 
Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.” 
Think of it, talk like that at such a timel 
What had how long it takes a birch to rot 
To do with what was in the darkened parlor. 
You couldn’t care! The nearest friends can go 
With anyone to death, comes so far short 
They might as well not try to go at all 
No, from the time when one is sick to death. 

One is alone, and he dies more alone. 

Friends make pretense of following to the grave. 
But before one is in it, their minds are turned 
And making the best of their way back to life 
And living people, and things they understand. 
But the world’s evil. I won’t have grief so 
If I can change it. Oh, I won’t I won’t!’ 

There, you have said it all and you feel better. 
You won’t go now. You're crying. Close the door. 
[ 72 ] 



The heart's gone out of it: why keep it up. 
Amy! There’s someone coming down the road!’ 


Yon— oh, you think the talk is all. I must go— 
Somewhere out of this house. How can I make you—* 

‘If— you— do!’ She was opening the door wider. 
‘Where do you mean to go? First tell me that. 

I’ll follow and bring you back by force. I willl— 


[ 73 ] 



THE BLACK COTTAGE 


We chanced in passing by that afternoon 
To catch it in a sort of special picture 
Among tar-banded ancient cherry trees, 

Set well bach from the road in rank lodged grass. 
The little cottage we were speaking of, 

A front with just a door between two windows. 
Fresh painted by the shower a velvet black. 

We paused, the minister and I, to look. 

He made as if to hold it at arm's length 
Or put the leaves aside that framed it in. 

"Pretty/ he said. ‘Come in. No one will care/ 

The path was a vague parting in the grass 
That led us to a weathered window-sill. 

We pressed our faces to the pane. ‘You see/ he said, 
‘Everything’s as she left it when she died. 

Her sons won’t sell the house or the things m it. 
They say they mean to come and summer here 
Where they were boys. They haven’t come this year. 
They live so far away— one is out west— 

It will be hard for them to keep their word. 

Anyway they won’t have the place disturbed.’ 

A buttoned hair-cloth lounge spread scrolling arms 
Under a crayon portrait on the wall, 

Done sadly from an old daguerreotype. 

That was the father as he went to war. 

She always, when she talked about the war. 

Sooner or later came and leaned, half knelt 
Against the lounge beside it, though I doubt 
If such unhfelike lines kept power to stir 
Anything in her after all the years. 

He fell at Gettysburg or Fredericksburg, 

[ 74 ] 



I ought to know— it makes a difference which: 
Fredericksburg wasn’t Gettysburg, of course. 
But what I’m getting to is how forsaken 
A little cottage this has always seemed; 

Since she went more than ever, but before— 

I don’t mean altogether by the hves 
That had gone out of it, the father first. 

Then the two sons, till she was left alone. 
(Nothing could draw her after those two sons. 
She valued the considerate neglect 
She had at some cost taught them after years.) 
I mean by the world’s having passed it by— 

As we almost got by this afternoon. 

It always seems to me a sort of mark 
To measure how far fifty years have brought us. 
Why not sit down if you are in no haste? 

These doorsteps seldom have a visitor. 

The warping boards pull out their own old nails 
With none to tread and put them in their place. 
She had her own idea of things, the old lady. 
And she liked talk. She had seen Garrison 
And Whittier, and had her story of them. 

One wasn’t long in learning that she thought 
Whatever else the Civil War was for, 

It wasn’t just to keep the States together. 

Nor just to free the slaves, though it did both. 
She wouldn’t have believed those ends enough 
To have given outright for them all she gave. 
Her giving somehow touched the principle 
That all men are created free and equal. 

And to hear her quaint phrases— so removed 
From the world’s view today of all those things. 
That’s a hard mystery of Jefferson’s. 

[ 75 ] 



What did he mean? Of course the easy way 
Is to decide it simply isn’t true. 

It may not be. I heard a fellow say so. 

But never mind, the Welshman got it planted 
Where it will trouble us a thousand years. 

Each age will have to reconsider it. 

You couldn’t tell her what the West was saying, 
And what the South to her serene belief. 

She had some art of hearing and yet not 
Hearing the latter wisdom of the world. 

White was the only race she ever knew. 

Black she had scarcely seen, and yellow never. 
But how could they be made so very unlike 
By the same hand working in the same stuff? 

She had supposed the war decided that. 

What are you going to do with such a person? 
Strange how such innocence gets its own way. 

I shouldn’t be surprised if in this world 
It were the force that would at last prevail. 

Do you know but for her there was a time 
When to please younger members of the church, 
Or rather say non-members in the church, 

Whom we all have to think of nowadays, 

I would have changed the Creed a very little? 
Not that she ever had to ask me not to; 

It never got so far as that; but the bare thought 
Of her old tremulous bonnet in the pew, 

And of her half asleep was too much for me. 
Why, I might wake her up and startle her. 

It was the words “descended into Hades” 

That seemed too pagan to our liberal youth. 

You know they suffered from a general onslaught. 
And well, if they weren’t true why keep right on 
[ 76 ] 



Saying them like the heathen? We could drop them. 
Only— there was the bonnet in the pew. 

Such a phrase couldn’t have meant much to her. 

But suppose she had missed it from the Creed 
As a child misses the unsaid Good-night, 

And falls asleep with heartache— how should I feel? 
I’m just as glad she made me keep hands off. 

For, dear me, why abandon a belief 
Merely because it ceases to be true. 

Cling to it long enough, and not a doubt 
It will turn true again, for so it goes. 

Most of the change we think we see in life 
Is due to truths being in and out of favor. 

As I sit here, and oftentimes, I wish 
I could be monarch of a desert land 
I could devote and dedicate forever 
To the truths we keep coming back and back to. 

So desert it would have to be, so walled 
By mountain ranges half in summer snow. 

No one would covet it or think it worth 
The pains of conquering to force change on. 
Scattered oases where men dwelt, but mostly 
Sand dunes held loosely in tamarisk 
Blown over and over themselves in idleness. 

Sand grains should sugar in the natal dew 
The babe bom to the desert, the sand storm 
Retard mid-waste my cowering caravans— 

There are bees in this wall.’ He struck the clapboards. 
Fierce heads looked out; small bodies pivoted. 

We rose to go. Sunset blazed on the windows. 


[ 77 ] 



BLUEBERRIES 


‘You ought to have seen what I saw on my way 
To the village, through Pattersons pasture today: 
Blueberries as big as the end of your thumb. 

Real sky-blue, and heavy, and ready to drum 
In the cavernous pail of the first one to come! 

And all ripe together, not some of them green 
And some of them ripe! You ought to have seen!’ 

‘I don’t know what part of the pasture you mean.’ 

‘You know where they cut off the woods— let me see— 
It was two years ago— or no!— can it be 
No longer than that?— and the following fall 
The fire ran and burned it all up but the wall.’ 

'Why, there hasn’t been time for the bushes to grow. 
That’s always the way with the blueberries, though: 
There may not have been the ghost of a sign 
Of them anywhere under the shade of the pine. 

But get the pine out of the way, you may bum 
The pasture all over until not a fern 
Or grass-blade is left, not to mention a stick, 

And presto, they’re up all around you as thick 
And hard to explain as a conjuror’s trick.’ 

‘It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit. 

I taste in them sometimes the flavor of soot. 

And after all really they’re ebony skinned: 

The blue’s but a mist from the breath of the wind, 

A tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand, 

And less than the tan with which pickers are tanned.’ 

[ 78 ] 



‘Does Patterson know what he has, do jou think?’ 

‘He may and not care and so leave the chewink 
To gather them for him— you know what he is. 

He won’t make the fact that they’re rightfully his 
An excuse for keeping us other folk out.’ 

‘I wonder you didn’t see Loren about.’ 

‘The best of it was that I did. Do you know, 

I was just getting through what the field had to show 
And over the wall and into the road. 

When who should come by, with a democrat-load 
Of all the young chattering Lorens alive. 

But Loren, the fatherly, out for a drive.’ 

‘He saw you, then? What did he do? Did he frown?’ 

‘He just kept nodding his head up and down. 

You know how politely he always goes by. 

But he thought a big thought— I could tell by his eye— 
Which being expressed, might be this in effect: 

“I have left those there berries, I shrewdly suspect. 

To ripen too long. I am greatly to blame.” ’ 

‘He’s a thriftier person than some I could name.’ 

‘He seems to be thrifty; and hasn’t he need, 

With the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed? 
He has brought them all up on wild berries, they say. 
Like birds. They store a great many away. 

They eat them the year round, and those they don’t eat 
They sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet.’ 

[ 79 ] 



Who cares what they say? It’s a nice way to live. 

Just taking what Nature is willing to give, 

Not forcing her hand with harrow and plow.’ 

‘I wish you had seen his perpetual bow— 

And the air of the youngsters! No one of them turned, 
And they looked so solemn-absurdly concerned.’ 

1 wish I knew half what the flock of them know 
Of where all the berries and other things grow, 
Cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top 
Of the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they will crop, 
I met them one day and each had a flower 
Stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower; 

Some strange kind— they told me it hadn’t a name.’ 

Tve told you how once not long after we came, 

I almost provoked poor Loren to mirth 

By going to him of all people on earth 

To ask if he knew any fruit to be had 

For the picking. The rascal, he said he’d be glad 

To tell if he knew. But the year had been bad. 

There had been some berries— but those were all gone. 
He didn’t say where they had been. He went on: 

“I’m sure— I’m sure”— as polite as could be. 

He spoke to his wife in the door, “Let me see, 

Marne, we don’t know any good berrying place?” 

It was all he could do to keep a straight face.’ 

‘If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him, 
He’ll find he’s mistaken. See here, for a whim. 

We’ll pick in the Pattersons’ pasture this year. 

We’ll go in the morning, that is, if it’s dear, 

[ 80 ] 



And the sun shines out warm: the vines must be wet. 
It’s so long since I picked I almost forget 
How we used to pick berries : we took one look rounds 
Then sank out of sight like trolls underground. 

And saw nothing more of each other, or heard. 

Unless when you said I was keeping a bird 
Away from its nest, and I said it was you. 

“Well, one of us is.” For complaining it flew 
Around and around us. And then for a while 
We picked, till I feared you had wandered a mile, 
And I thought I had lost you. I lifted a shout 
Too loud for the distance you were, it turned out. 

For when you made answer, your voice was as low 
As talking— you stood up beside me, vou know.’ 

'We sha n’t have the place to ourselves to enjoy— 

Not likely, when all the young Lorens deploy. 

They’ll be there tomorrow, or even tonight. 

They won’t be too friendly— they may be polite— 

To people they look on as having no right 

To pick where they’re picking. But we won’t complain. 

You ought to have seen how it looked in the rain, 

The fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves, 

Like two kinds of jewels, a vision for thieves.’ 



A SERVANT TO SERVANTS 


I didn’t make you know how glad I was 
To have you come and camp here on our land. 

I promised myself to get down some day 
And see the way you lived, but I don’t know! 

With a houseful of hungry men to feed 
I guess you’d find. ... It seems to me 
I can’t express my feelings any more 
Than I can raise my voice or want to lift 
My hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to). 

Did ever you feel so? I hope you never. 

It’s got so I don’t even know for sure 
Whether I am glad, sorry, or anything. 

There’s nothing but a voice-like left inside 
That seems to tell me how I ought to feel. 

And would feel if I wasn’t all gone wrong. 

You take the lake. I look and look at it. 

I see it’s a fair, pretty sheet of water. 

I stand and make myself repeat out loud 
The advantages it has, so long and narrow. 

Like a deep piece of some old running river 
Cut short off at both ends. It lies five miles 
Straight away through the mountain notch 
From the sink window where I wash the plates. 

And all our storms come up toward the house, 

Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter. 
It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit 
To step outdoors and take the water dazzle 
A sunny morning, or take the rising wind 
About my face and body and through my wrapper, 
When a storm threatened from the Dragon’s Den, 

And a cold chill shivered across the lake. 

[ 82 ] 



I see it’s a fair, pretty sheet of water, 

Our Willoughby! How did you hear of it? 

I expect, though, everyone’s heard of it. 

In a book about ferns? Listen to that! 

You let things more like feathers regulate 
Your going and coming. And you like it here? 

I can see how you might. But I don’t know! 

It would be different if more people came, 

For then there would be business. As it is, 

The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them. 
Sometimes we don’t. We’ve a good piece of shore 
That ought to be worth something, and may yet. 
But I don’t count on it as much as Len. 

He looks on the bright side of everything. 
Including me. He thinks I’ll be all right 
With doctoring. But it’s not medicine— 

Lowe is the only doctor’s dared to say so— 

It’s rest I want— there, I have said it out— 

From cooking meals for hungry hired men 
And washing dishes after them— from doing 
Things over and over that just won’t stay done. 

By good rights I ought not to have so much 
Put on me, but there seems no other way. 

Len says one steady pull more ought to do it. 

He says the best way out is always through. 

And I agree to that, or in so far 
As that I can see no way out but through— 
Leastways for me— and then they’ll be convinced. 
It’s not that Len don’t want the best for me. 

It was his plan our moving over in 

Beside the lake from where that day I showed you 

We used to live— ten miles from anywhere. 

We didn’t change without some sacrifice, 

[ 83 ] 



But Len went at it to make up the loss. 

His work’s a man’s, df course, from sun to sun. 

But he works when he works as hard as I do— 
Though there’s small profit in comparisons. 

(Women and men will make them all the same.) 

But work ain’t all. Len undertakes too much. 

He’s into everything in town. This year 
It’s highways, and he’s got too many men 
Around him to look after that make waste. 

They take advantage of him shamefully, 

And proud, too, of themselves for doing so. 

We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings, 
Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk 
While I fry their bacon. Much they care! 

No more put out in what they do or say 
Than if I wasn’t in the room at all. 

Coming and going all the time, they are: 

I don’t learn what their names are, let alone 
Their characters, or whether they are safe 
To have inside the house with doors unlocked. 

I’m not afraid of them, though, if they’re not 
Afraid of me. There’s two can play at that. 

I have my fancies: it runs in the family. 

My father’s brother wasn’t right. They kept him 
Locked up for years back there at the old farm. 

I’ve been away once— yes. I’ve been away. 

The State Asylum. I was prejudiced; 

I wouldn’t have sent anyone of mine there; 

You know the old idea— the only asylum 
Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford, 
Rather than send their folks to such a place. 

Kept them at home; and it does seem more human. 
But it’s not so: the place is the asylum. 

[ 84 ] 



There they have every means proper to do with, 
And you aren’t darkening other people’s lives— 
Worse than no good to them, and they no good 
To you in your condition; you can’t know 
Affection or the want of it in that state. 

I’ve heard too much of the old-fashioned way. 

My father’s brother, he went mad quite young. 
Some thought he had been bitten by a dog, 
Because his violence took on the form 
Of carrying his pillow in his teeth; 

But it’s more likely he was crossed in love, 

Or so the story goes. It was some girl. 

Anyway all he talked about was love. 

They soon saw he would do someone a mischief 
If he wa’n’t kept strict watch of, and it ended 
In father’s building him a sort of cage, 

Or room within a room, of hickory poles, 

Like stanchions in the bam, from floor to ceiling,— 
A narrow passage all the way around. 

Anything they put in for furniture 
He’d tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on. 

So they made the place comfortable with straw. 
Like a beast’s stall, to ease their consciences. 

Of course they had to feed him without dishes. 
They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded 
With his clothes on his arm— all of his clothes. 
Cruel— it sounds. I s’pose they did the best 
They knew. And just when he was at the height. 
Father and mother married, and mother came, 

A bride, to help take care of such a creature, 

And accommodate her young life to his. 

That was what marrying father meant to her. 

She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful 

[ 85 ] 



By his shouts in the night. He’d shout and shout 
Until the strength was shouted out of him, 

And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion. 
He’d pull his bars apart like bow and bowstring, 
And let them go and make them twang until 
His hands had worn them smooth as any oxbow. 

And then he’d crow as if he thought that child’s play 
The only fun he had. I’ve heard them say, though. 
They found a way to put a stop to it. 

He was before my time— I never saw him ; 

But the pen stayed exactly as it was 
There in the upper chamber in the ell, 

A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter. 

I often think of the smooth hickory bars. 

It got so I would say— you know, half fooling— 

‘It’s time I took my turn upstairs in jail’ — 

Just as you will till it becomes a habit. 

No wonder I was glad to get away. 

Mind you, I waited till Len said the word. 

I didn’t want the blame if things went wrong. 

I was glad though, no end, when we moved out. 

And I looked to be happy, and I was, 

As I said, for a while— but I don’t know! 

Somehow the change wore out like a prescription. 
And there’s more to it than |ust window-views 
And living by a lake. I’m past such help— 

Unless Len took the notion, which he won’t. 

And I won’t ask him— it’s not sure enough. 

I s’pose I’ve got to go the road I’m going: 

Other folks have to, and why shouldn’t I? 

I almost think if I could do like you, 

Drop everything and live out on the ground— 

But it might be, come night, I shouldn’t like it, 

[ 86 ] 



Or a long rain. I should soon get enough, 

And be glad of a good roof overhead. 

I’ve lain awake thinking of you, 111 warrant. 

More than, you have yourself, some of these nights. 
The wonder was the tents weren’t snatched away 
From over you as you lay in your beds. 

I haven’t courage for a risk like that. 

Bless you, of course, you’re keeping me from work. 
But the thing of it is, I need to be kept. 

There’s work enough to do— there’s always that; 
But behind’s behind. The worst that you can do 
Is set me back a little more behind. 

I sha’n’t catch up in this world, anyway. 

I’d rather you’d not go unless you must. 


[ 87 ] 



AFTER APPLE-PICKING 


My long two-pointed ladder’s sticking through a tree 
Toward heaven still, 

And there’s a barrel that I didn’t fill 
Beside it, and there may be two or three 
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough. 

But I am done with apple-picking now. 

Essence of winter sleep is on the night. 

The scent of apples: I am drowsing off. 

I c ann ot rub the strangeness from my sight 
I got from looking through a pane of glass 
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough 
And held against the world of hoary grass. 

It melted, and I let it fall and break. 

But I was well 

Upon my way to sleep before it fell. 

And I could tell 

What form my dreaming was about to take. 
Magnified apples appear and disappear. 

Stem end and blossom end, 

And every fleck of russet showing clear. 

My instep arch not only keeps the ache, 

It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round. 

I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend. 

And I keep hearing from the cellar bin 

The rumbling sound 

Of load on load of apples coming in. 

For I have had too much 
Of apple-picking: I am overtired 
Of the great harvest I myself desired. 

There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch. 
Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall. 

[ 88 ] 



For all 

That struck the earth. 

No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble, 
Went surely to the cider-apple heap 
As of no worth. 

One can see what will trouble 

This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is. 

Were he not gone, 

The woodchuck could say whether it’s like his 
Long sleep, as I describe its coming on, 

Or just some human sleep. 


[ 89 ] 



THE CODE 


There were three in the meadow by the brook 
Gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay. 

With an eye always lifted toward the west 
Where an irregular sun-bordered cloud 
Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger 
Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly 
One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground, 
Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed. 
The town-bred farmer failed to understand. 

“What is there wrong?’ 


'Something you just now said.’ 


*What did I say?’ 


‘About our taking pains.’ 

‘To cock the hay?— because it’s going to shower? 

I said that more than half an hour ago. 

I said it to myself as much as you.’ 

‘You didn’t know. But James is one big fool. 

He thought you meant to find fault with his work. 
That’s what the average farmer would have meant. 
James would take time, of course, to chew it over 
Before he acted: he’s just got round to act.’ 

He is a fool if that’s the way he takes me.’ 


‘Don’t let it bother you. You’ve found out something. 

[ 90 ] 



The hand that knows his business won’t be told 
To do work better or faster— those two things. 

I’m as particular as anyone: 

Most likely I’d have served you just the same. 

But I know you don’t understand our ways. 

You were just talking what was in your mind. 

What was in all our minds, and you weren’t hinting. 
Tell you a story of what happened once: 

I was up here in Salem at a man’s 
Named Sanders with a gang of four or five 
Doing the haying. No one liked the boss. 

He was one of the kind sports call a spider. 

All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy 
From a humped body nigh as big’s a biscuit 
But work! that man could work, especially 
If by so doing he could get more work 
Out of his hired help. I’m not denying 
He was hard on himself. I couldn’t find 
That he kept any hours— not for himself. 

Daylight and lantern-light were one to him: 

I’ve heard him pounding in the barn all night. 

But what he liked was someone to encourage. 

Them that he couldn’t lead he’d get behind 
And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing— 
Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off. 
I’d seen about enough of his bulling tricks 
(We call that bulling). I’d been watching him. 

So when he paired off with me in the hayfield 
To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble. 

I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders 
Combed it down with a rake and says, “O.K.” 
Everything went well till we reached the bam 
With a big jag to empty in a bay. 

[ 91 ] 



You understand that meant the easy job 
For the man up on top of throwing down 
The hay and rolling it off wholesale. 

Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting. 
You wouldn’t think a fellow’d need much urging 
Under those circumstances, would you now? 

But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands. 

And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit, 

Shouts like an army captain, “Let her come!” 
Thinks I, D’ye mean it? “What was that you said?” 
I asked out loud, so’s there’d be no mistake, 

“Did you say. Let her come?” “Yes, let her come.” 
He said it over, but he said it softer. 

Never you say a thing like that to a man, 

Not if he values what he is. God, I’d as soon 
Murdered him as left out his middle name. 

I’d built the load and knew right where to find it. 
Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for 
Like meditating, and then I just dug in 
And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots. 

I looked over the side once in the dust 
And caught sight of him treading-water-like. 
Keeping his head above. “Damn ye,” I says, 

“That gets ye!” He squeaked like a squeezed rat 
That was the last I saw or heard of him. 

I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off. 

As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck, 

And sort of waiting to be asked about it. 

One of the boys sings out, “Where’s the old man?” 
“I left him in the bam under the hay. 

If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.” 

They realized from the way I swabbed my neck 
More than was needed something must be up. 

[ 92 ] 



They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was. 
They told me afterward. First they forked hay, 

A lot of it, out into the barn floor. 

Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle. 

I guess they thought I’d spiked him in the temple 
Before I buried him, or I couldn’t have managed. 
They excavated more. "Go keep his wife 
Out of the bam.” Someone looked in a window, 
And curse me if he wasn’t in the kitchen 
Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet 
Against the stove, the hottest day that summer. 

He looked so clean disgusted from behind 
There was no one that dared to stir him up, 

Or let him know that he was being looked at. 
Apparently I hadn’t buried him 
(I may have knocked him down); but my just trying 
To bury him had hurt his dignity. 

He had gone to the house so’s not to meet me. 

He kept away from us all afternoon. 

We tended to his hay. We saw him out 
After a while picking peas in his garden: 

He couldn’t keep away from doing something.’ 

Weren’t you relieved to find he wasn’t dead?’ 

‘No! and yet I don’t know— it’s hard to say. 

I went about to kill him fair enough.’ 

‘You took an awkward way. Did he discharge you?’ 

‘Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right’ 


[93J 



THE GENERATIONS OF MEN 


A governor it was proclaimed this time, 

When all who would come seeking in New Hampshire 
Ancestral memories might come together. 

And those of the name Stark gathered in Bow, 

A rock-strewn town where farming has fallen off, 

And sprout-lands flourish where the ax has gone. 
Someone had literally run to earth 
In an old cellar hole in a by-road 
The origin of all the family there. 

Thence they were sprung, so numerous a tribe 
That now not all the houses left in town 
Made shift to shelter them without the help 
Of here and there a tent in grove and orchard. 

They were at Bow, but that was not enough: 

Nothing would do but they must fix a day 
To stand together on the crater’s verge 
That turned them on the world, and try to fathom 
The past and get some strangeness out of it. 

But rain spoiled all. The day began uncertain, 

With clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted. 
The young folk held some hope out to each other 
Till well toward noon when the storm settled down 
With a swish in the grass. What if the others 
Are there,’ they said. Tt isn’t going to rain.’ 

Only one from a farm not far away 
Strolled thither, not expecting he would find 
Anyone else, but out of idleness. 

One, and one other, yes, for there were two. 

The second round the curving hillside road 
Was a girl; and she halted some way off 
To reconnoiter, and then made up her mind 

[ 94 ] 



At least to pass by and see who he was, 

And perhaps hear some word about the weather. 
This was some Stark she didn’t know. He nodded. 
'No fete today,’ he said. 


‘It looks that way.’ 

She swept the heavens, turning on her heel. 
‘I only idled down.’ 


1 idled down.’ 

Provision there had been for just such meeting 
Of stranger cousins, in a family tree 
Drawn on a sort of passport with the branch 
Of the one bearing it done in detail— 

Some zealous one’s laborious device. 

She made a sudden movement toward her bodice, 
As one who clasps her heart. They laughed together. 
‘Stark?’ he inquired. ‘No matter for the proof.’ 

‘Yes, Stark. And you?’ 


‘I’m Stark.’ He drew his passport 

“You know we might not be and still be cousins: 

The town is full of Chases, Lowes, and Baileys, 

All claiming some priority in Starkness. 

My mother was a Lane, yet might have married 
Anyone upon earth and still her children 
Would have been Starks, and doubtless here today.’ 

*You riddle with your genealogy 
Like a Viola. I don’t follow you.’ 

[ 95 ] 



1 only mean my mother was a Stark 
Several times over, and by marrying father 
No more than brought us back into the name.’ 

‘One ought not to be thrown into confusion 
By a plain statement of relationship, 

But I own what you say makes my head spin. 

You take my card— you seem so good at such things 
And see if you can reckon our cousinship. 

Why not take seats here on the cellar wall 
And dangle feet among the raspberry vines?’ 

‘Under the shelter of the family tree.’ 

‘Just so— that ought to be enough protection.’ 

‘Not from the rain. I think it’s going to rain.’ 

‘It’s raining.’ 


‘No, it’s misting; let’s be fair. 

Does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes?’ 

The situation was like this: the road 
Bowed outward on the mountain halfway up, 

And disappeared and ended not far off. 

No one went home that way. The only house 
Beyond where they were was a shattered seedpod. 
And below roared a brook hidden in trees, 

The sound of which was silence for the place. 

This he sat listening to till she gave judgment. 

*On father’s side, it seems, we’re— let me see—’ 

[ 96 ] 



‘Don’t be too technical.— You have three cards.’ 


‘Four cards, one yours, three mine, one for each branch 
Of the Stark family I’m a member of.’ 

‘D’you know a person so related to herself 
Is supposed to be mad.’ 


‘I may be mad.’ 

‘You look so, sitting out here in the rain 
Studying genealogy with me 
You never saw before. What will we come to 
With all this pride of ancestry, we Yankees? 

I think we’re all mad. Tell me why we’re here 
Drawn into town about this cellar hole 
Like wild geese on a lake before a storm? 

What do we see in such a hole, I wonder.’ 

‘The Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc, 

Which means The Seven Caves that We Came out of. 
This is the pit from which we Starks were digged.’ 

“You must be learned. That’s what you see in it?’ 

‘And what do you see?’ 


‘Yes, what do I see? 
First let me look. I see raspberry vines—’ 

‘Oh, if you’re going to use your eyes, just hear 
WTiat I see. It’s a little, little boy, 

As pale and dim as a match flame in the sun; 

[ 97 ] 



He’s groping in the cellar after jam. 

He thinks it’s dark and it’s flooded with daylight.’ 


‘He’s nothing. Listen. When I lean like this 
I can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly,— 

With his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug— 

Bless you, it isn’t Grandsir Stark, it’s Granny, 

But the pipe’s there and smoking and the jug. 

She’s after cider, the old girl, she’s thirsty; 

Here’s hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely.’ 

‘Tell me about her. Does she look like me?’ 

‘She should, shouldn’t she, you’re so many times 

Over descended from her. I believe 

She does look like you. Stay the way you are. 

The nose is just the same, and so’s the chin— 

Making allowance, making due allowance.’ 

‘You poor, dear, great, great, great, great Granny!’ 

‘See that you get her greatness right. Don’t stint her.’ 

‘Yes, it’s important, though you think it isn’t. 

I won’t be teased. But see bow wet I am.’ 

‘Yes, you must go; we can’t stay here for ever. 

But wait until I give you a hand up. 

A bead of silver water more or less 

Strung on your hair won’t hurt your summer looks. 

I wanted to try something with the noise 
That the brook raises in the empty valley. 

We have seen visions— now consult the voices. 

[ 98 ] 



Something I must have learned riding in trains 
When I was young. I used to use the roar 
To set the voices speaking out of it, 

Speaking or singing, and the band-music playing. 
Perhaps you have the art of what I mean. 

Ive never listened in among the sounds 
That a brook makes in such a wild descent. 

It ought to give a purer oracle.’ 

‘It’s as you throw a picture on a screen: 

The meaning of it all is out of you; 

The voices give you what you wish to hear.’ 

‘Strangely, it’s anything they wish to give.’ 

‘Then I don’t know. It must be strange enough. 

I wonder if it’s not your make-believe. 

What do you think you’re like to hear today?’ 

‘From the sense of our having been together— 

But why take time for what I’m like to hear? 

I’ll tell you what the voices really say. 

You will do very well right where you are 
A little longer. I mustn’t feel too hurried, 

Or I can’t give myself to hear the voices.’ 

‘Is this some trance you are withdrawing into?’ 

“You must be very still; you mustn’t talk.’ 

Til hardly breathe.’ 


The voices seem to say—’ 


[ 99 ] 



‘I’m waiting/ 


‘Don’t! The voices seem to say: 

Call her Nausicaa, the unafraid 

Of an acquaintance made adventurously.’ 

‘I let you say that— on consideration.’ 

‘I don’t see very well how you can help it. 

You want the truth. I speak but by the voices. 

You see they know I haven’t had your name, 
Though what a name should matter between us—’ 

‘I shall suspect—’ 


‘Be good. The voices say: 

Call her Nausicaa, and take a timber 
That you shall find lies in the cellar charred 
Among the raspberries, and hew and shape it 
For a door-sill or other corner piece 
In a new cottage on the ancient spot. 

The life is not yet all gone out of it. 

And come and make your summer dwelling here. 
And perhaps she will come, still unafraid. 

And sit before you in the open door 
With flowers in her lap until they fade, 

But not come in across the sacred sill—’ 

‘I wonder where your oracle is tending. 

You can see that there’s something wrong with it. 
Or it would speak in dialect. Whose voice 
Does it purport to speak in? Not old Grandsir’s 
Nor Granny’s, surely. Call up one of them. 

They have best right to be heard in this place.’ 

[ 100 ] 



‘You seem so partial to our great-grandmother 
(Nine times removed. Correct me if I err.) 

You will be likely to regard as sacred 
Anything she may say. But let me warn you, 

Folks in her day were given to plain speaking. 

You think you’d best tempt her at such a time?’ 

‘It rests with us always to cut her off.’ 

'Well then, it’s Granny speaking: “I dunnow! 

Mebbe I’m wrong to take it as I do. 

There ain’t no names quite like the old ones though. 
Nor never will be to my way of thinking. 

One mustn’t bear too hard on the newcomers. 

But there’s a dite too many of them for comfort. 

I should feel easier if I could see 

More of the salt wherewith they’re to be salted. 

Son, you do as you’re told! You take the timber— 

It’s as sound as the day when it was cut— 

And begin over—” There, she’d better stop. 

You can see what is troubling Granny, though. 

But don’t you think we sometimes make too much 
Of the old stock? What counts is the ideals, 

And those will bear some keeping still about.’ 

‘I can see we are going to be good friends.’ 

‘I like your “going to be.” You said just now 
It’s going to rain.’ 


‘I know, and it was raining. 
I let you say all that. But I must go now.’ 


[ 101 ] 



‘You let me say it? on consideration? 

How shall we say good-by in such a case?’ 

‘How shall we?’ 


‘Will you leave the way to me?’ 

‘No, I don’t trust your eyes. You’ve said enough. 
Now give me your hand up— Pick me that flower.’ 

‘Where shall we meet again?’ 


‘Nowhere but here 

Once more before we meet elsewhere.’ 


‘In rain?’ 


It ought to be in rain. Sometime in rain. 
In rain tomorrow, shall we, if it rains? 

But if we must, in sunshine.’ So she went. 


[ 102 ] 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 


I let myself in at the kitchen door. 

‘It’s you,’ she said. ‘I can’t get up. Forgive me 
Not answering your knock. I can no more 
Let people in than I can keep them out. 

I’m getting too old for my size, I tell them. 

My fingers are about all Ive the use of 
So’s to take any comfort. I can sew: 

I help out with this beadwork what I can.’ 

‘That’s a smart pair of pumps you’re beading there. 
Who are they for?’ 


‘You mean?— oh, for some miss. 
I can’t keep track of other people’s daughters. 

Lord, if I were to dream of everyone 
Whose shoes I primped to dance in!’ 


‘And where’s John?* 

‘Haven’t you seen him? Strange what set you off 
To come to his house when he’s gone to yours. 

You can’t have passed each other. I know what: 

He must have changed his mind and gone to Garland’s. 
He won’t be long in that case. You can wait. 

Though what good you can be, or anyone— 

It’s gone so far. You’ve heard? Estelle’s run off.’ 

‘Yes, what’s it all about? When did she go?’ 

‘Two weeks since.’ 


‘She’s in earnest, it appears.’ 


[ 103 ] 



Tm sure she won’t come back. She’s hiding somewhere. 
I don’t know where myself. John thinks I do. 

He thinks I only have to say the word. 

And she’ll come back. But, bless you, I’m her mother— 
I can’t talk to her, and, Lord, if I could!’ 

‘It will go hard with John. What will he do? 

He can’t find anyone to take her place.’ 

! Oh, if you ask me that, what will he do? 

He gets some sort of bakeshop meals together, 

With me to sit and tell him everything. 

What’s wanted and how much and where it is. 

But when I’m gone— of course I can’t stay here: 

Estelle’s to take me when she’s settled down. 

He and I only hinder one another. 

I tell them they can’t get me through the door, though: 
I’ve been built in here like a big church organ. 

We’ve been here fifteen years.’ 


‘That’s a long time 
To live together and then pull apart. 

How do you see him living when you’re gone? 
Two of you out will leave an empty house.’ 

T don’t just see him living many years. 

Left here with nothing but the furniture. 

I hate to think of the old place when we’re gone. 
With the brook going by below the yard. 

And no one here but hens blowing about. 

If he could sell the place, but then, he can’t: 

No one will ever live on it again. 

It’s too run down. This is the last of it. 

[ 104 ] 



What I think he will do, is let things smash. 

He’ll sort of swear the time away. He’s awful! 

I never saw a man let family troubles 
Make so much difference in his man’s affairs. 

He’s just dropped everything. He’s like a child. 

I blame his being brought up by his mother. 

He’s got hay down that’s been rained on three times. 
He hoed a little yesterday for me: 

I thought the growing things would do him good. 
Something went wrong. I saw him throw the hoe 
Sky-high with both hands. I can see it now— 

Come here— I’ll show you— in that apple tree. 

That’s no way for a man to do at his age: 

He’s fifty-five, you know, if he’s a day.’ 

‘Aren’t you afraid of him? What’s that gun for?’ 

‘Oh, that’s been there for hawks since chicken-time. 
John Hall touch me! Not if he knows his friends. 

I’ll say that for him, John’s no threatener 
Like some menfolk. No one’s afraid of him; 

All is, he’s made up his mind not to stand 
What he has got to stand.’ 


‘Where is Estelle? 
Couldn’t one talk to her? What does she say? 
You say you don’t know where she is.’ 


‘Nor want to! 

She thinks if it was bad to live with him. 

It must be right to leave him.’ 


‘Which is wrong!’ 

[ 105 ] 



‘Yes, but he should have married her.’ 


‘I know.’ 

‘The strain’s been too much for her all these years: 
I can’t explain it any other way. 

It’s different with a man, at least with John: 

He knows he’s kinder than the run of men. 

Better than married ought to be as good 
As married— that’s what he has always said. 

I know the way he’s felt— but all the samel’ 

‘I wonder why he doesn’t marry her 
And end it.’ 


‘Too late now: she wouldn’t have him. 
He’s given her time to think of something else. 

That’s his mistake. The dear knows my interest 
Has been to keep the thing from breaking up. 

This is a good home: I don’t ask for better. 

But when I’ve said, “Why shouldn’t they be married,” 
He’d say, “Why should they?” no more words than that.’ 

‘And after all why should they? John’s been fair 
I take it. What was his was always hers. 

There was no quarrel about property.’ 

‘Reason enough, there was no property. 

A friend or two as good as own the farm. 

Such as it is. It isn’t worth the mortgage.’ 

‘I mean Estelle has always held the purse.’ 


[ 106 ] 



‘The rights of that are harder to get at. 

I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse. 

’Twas we let him have money, not he us. 

John’s a bad farmer. I’m not blaming him. 

Take it year in, year out, he doesn’t make much. 
We came here for a home for me, you know, 
Estelle to do the housework for the board 
Of both of us. But look how it turns out: 

She seems to have the housework, and besides 
Half of the outdoor work, though as for that, 
He’d say she does it more because she likes it. 
You see our pretty things are all outdoors. 

Our hens and cows and pigs are always better 
Than folks like us have any business with. 
Fanners around twice as well off as we 
Haven’t as good. They don’t go with the farm. 
One thing you can’t help liking about John, 

He’s fond of nice things— too fond, some would : 
But Estelle don’t complain: she’s like him there. 
She wants our hens to be the best there are. 

You never saw this room before a show. 

Full of lank, shivery, half -drowned birds 
In separate coops, having their plumage done. 
The smell of the wet feathers in the heat! 

You spoke of John’s not being safe to stay with. 
You don’t know what a gentle lot we are: 

We wouldn’t hurt a hen! You ought to see us 
Moving a flock of hens from place to place. 

We’re not allowed to take them upside down, 

All we can hold together by the legs. 

Two at a time’s the rule, one on each arm. 

No matter how far and how many times 
We have to go.’ 


[ 107 ] 



‘You mean that’s John’s idea.’ 


'And we live up to it; or I don’t know 
What childishness he wouldn’t give way to. 

He manages to keep the upper hand 
On his own farm. He’s boss. But as to hens: 

We fence our flowers in and the hens range. 
Nothing’s too good for them. We say it pays. 

John likes to tell the offers he has had, 

Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that. 

He never takes the money. If they’re worth 
That much to sell, they’re worth as much to keep. 
Bless you, it’s all expense, though. Reach me down 
The little tin box on the cupboard shelf. 

The upper shelf, the tin box. That’s the one. 

I’ll show you. Here you are.’ 


What’s this?’ 


‘A bill- 

For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock— 
Receipted. And the cock is in the yard.’ 

‘Not in a glass case, then?’ 


‘He’d need a tall one: 

He can eat off a barrel from the ground. 

He’s been in a glass case, as you may say. 

The Crystal Palace, London. He’s imported. 

John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads- 
Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don’t complain. 

But you see, don’t you, we take care of him.’ 


[ 108 ] 



‘And like it, too. It makes it all the worse/ 


‘It seems as if. And that’s not all: he’s helpless 
In ways that I can hardly tell you of. 

Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts 
To see where all the money goes so fast. 

You know how men will be ridiculous. 

But it’s just fun the way he gets bedeviled— 

If he’s untidy now, what will he be—?’ 

‘It makes it all the worse. You must be blind.’ 

‘Estelle’s the one. You needn’t talk to me.’ 

‘Can’t you and I get to the root of it? 

What’s the real trouble? What will satisfy her?’ 

‘It’s as I say: she’s turned from him, that’s all.’ 

‘But why, when she’s well off? Is it the neighbors, 
Being cut off from friends?’ 

‘We have our friends. 
That isn’t it. Folks aren’t afraid of us/ 

‘She’s let it worry her. You stood the strain, 

And you’re her mother.’ 


‘But I didn’t always. 

I didn’t relish it along at first. 

But I got wonted to it. And besides— 

John said I was too old to have grandchildren. 

[ 109 ] 



But what’s the use of talking when it’s done? 

She won’t come back— it’s worse than that— she can’t.’ 


‘Why do you speak like that? What do you know? 
What do you mean?— she’s done harm to herself?’ 

1 mean she’s married— married someone else.’ 

‘Oho, oho!’ 


‘You don’t believe me.’ 


‘Yes, I do, 

Only too well. I knew there must be something! 

So that was what was back. She’s bad, that’s all!’ 

‘Bad to get married when she had the chance?’ 

‘Nonsense! See what she’s done! But who, but who— ’ 

‘Who’d marry her straight out of such a mess? 

Say it right out— no matter for her mother. 

The man was found. I’d better name no names. 

John himself won’t imagine who he is.’ 

“Then it’s all up. I think I’ll get away. 

You’ll be expecting John. I pity Estelle; 

I suppose she deserves some pity, too. 

You ought to have the kitchen to yourself 
To break it to him. You may have the job.’ 

‘You needn’t think you’re going to get away. 

John’s almost here. I’ve had my eye on someone 
Coming down Ryan’s Hill. I thought ’twas him. 

[ 110 ] 



Here he is now. This box! Put it away. 
And this bill.’ 


‘What’s the hurry? He’ll unhitch.’ 

‘No, he won’t, either. He’ll just drop the reins 
And turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all. 

She won’t get far before the wheels hang up 
On something— there’s no harm. See, there he is! 

My, but he looks as if he must have heard!’ 

John threw the door wide but he didn’t enter. 

‘How are you, neighbor? Just the man I’m after. 
Isn’t it Hell,’ he said. ‘I want to know. 

Come out here if you want to hear me talk. 

I’ll talk to you, old woman, afterward. 

I’ve got some news that maybe isn’t news. 

What are they trying to do to me, these two?’ 

‘Do go along with him and stop his shouting.’ 

She raised her voice against the closing door: 

“Who wants to hear your news, you— dreadful fool?’ 


[Ill] 



THE FEAR 


A lantern light from deeper in the barn 
Shone on a man and woman in the door 
And threw their lurching shadows on a house 
Nearby, all dark in every glossy window. 

A horse’s hoof pawed once the hollow floor. 

And the back of the gig they stood beside 
Moved in a little. The man grasped a wheel. 
The woman spoke out sharply, ‘Whoa, stand still! 
I saw it just as plain as a white plate,’ 

She said, ‘as the light on the dashboard ran 
Along the bushes at the roadside— a man’s face, 
You must have seen it too.’ 


Are you sure—’ 


‘I didn’t see it. 


‘Yes, I’m sure!’ 


‘—it was a face?’ 

‘Joel, I’ll have to look. I can’t go in, 

I can’t, and leave a thing like that unsettled. 

Doors locked and curtains drawn will make no difference. 
I always have felt strange when we came home 
To the dark house after so long an absence. 

And the key rattled loudly into place 
Seemed to warn someone to be getting out 
At one door as we entered at another. 

What if I’m right, and someone all the time— 

Don’t hold my arm!’ 


[ 112 ] 



'I say it’s someone passing.’ 


Tou speak as if this were a traveled road. 

You forget where we are. What is beyond 
That he’d be going to or coming from 
At such an hour of night, and on foot too? 
What was he standing still for in the bushes?’ 

'It’s not so very late— it’s only dark. 

There’s more in it than you’re inclined to say. 
Did he look like—?’ 


‘He looked like anyone. 
I’ll never rest tonight unless I know. 

Give me the lantern.’ 


'You don’t want the lantern.’ 

She pushed past him and got it for herself. 

‘You’re not to come,’ she said. ‘This is my business 
If the time’s come to face it. I’m the one 
To put it the right way. He’d never dare— 

Listen! He kicked a stone. Hear that, hear that! 
He’s coming towards us. Joel, go in— please. 

Hark!— I don’t hear him now. But please go in.’ 

Tn the first place vou can’t make me believe it's— 

‘It is— or someone else he’s sent to watch. 

And now’s the time to have it out with him 
While we know definitely where he is. 

Let him get off and he’ll be everywhere 

[ 113 ] 



Around us, looking out of trees and bushes 
Till I sha n’t dare to set a foot outdoors. 

And I can’t stand it. Joel, let me go!’ 

'But it’s nonsense to think he’d care enough.’ 

“You mean you couldn’t understand his caring. 
Oh, but you see he hadn’t had enough— 

Joel, I won’t— I won’t— I promise you. 

We mustn’t say hard things. You mustn’t either.’ 

Til be the one, if anybody goes! 

But you give him the advantage with this light. 
What couldn’t he do to us standing here! 

And if to see was what he wanted, why, 

He has seen all there was to see and gone.’ 

He appeared to forget to keep his hold, 

But advanced with her as she crossed the grass. 

What do you want?’ she cried to all the dark. 

She stretched up tall to overlook the light 
That hung in both hands hot against her skirt. 

There’s no one; so you’re wrong,’ he said. 


‘There is.— 

What do you want?’ she cried, and then herself 
Was startled when an answer really came. 

‘Nothing.’ It came from well along the road. 

She reached a hand to Joel for support: 

The smell of scorching woolen made her faint. 

[ 114 ] 



“What are you doing round this house at night?’ 

‘Nothing.’ A pause: there seemed no more to say. 

And then the voice again: “You seem afraid. 

I saw by the way you whipped up the horse. 

I’ll just come forward in the lantern light 
And let you see.’ 


■Yes, do.— Joel, go back!’ 

She stood her ground against the noisy steps 
That came on, but her body rocked a little. 

You see,’ the voice said. 


‘Oh.’ She looked and looked. 

You don’t see— I’ve a child here by the hand. 

A robber wouldn’t have his family with him.’ 

‘What’s a child doing at this time of night—?’ 

‘Out walking. Every child should have the memory 
Of at least one long-after-bedtime walk. 

What, son?’ 

Then I should think you’d try to find 
Somewhere to walk—’ 


‘The highway, as it happens— 
We’re stopping for the fortnight down at Dean’s.’ 


[ 115 ] 



‘But if that’s all— Joel— you realize— 

You won’t think anything. You understand? 

You understand that we have to be careful. 
This is a very, very lonely place. 

Joel!’ She spoke as if she couldn’t turn. 

The swinging lantern lengthened to the ground. 
It touched, it struck, it clattered and went out. 


[ 116 ] 



THE SELF-SEEKER 


‘Willis, I didn’t want you here today: 

The lawyer’s coining for the company. 

I’m going to sell my soul, or, rather, feet. 

Five hundred dollars for the pair, you know.’ 

With you the feet have nearly been the soul; 

And if you’re going to sell them to the devil, 

I want to see you do it. When’s he coming?’ 

‘I half suspect you knew, and came on purpose 
To try to help me drive a better bargain.’ 

Well, if it’s true! Yours are no common feet. 

The lawyer don’t know what it is he’s buying: 

So many miles you might have walked you won’t walk. 
You haven’t run your forty orchids down. 

What does he think?— How are the blessed feet? 

The doctor’s sure you’re going to walk again?’ 

‘He thinks 111 hobble. It’s both legs and feet.’ 

They must be terrible— I mean to look at.’ 

1 haven’t dared to look at them uncovered. 

Through the bed blankets I remind myself 
Of a starfish laid out with rigid points.’ 

‘The wonder is it hadn’t been your head.’ 

‘It’s hard to tell you how I managed it. 

When I saw the shaft had me by the coat, 

[117] 



I didn’t try too long to pull away. 

Or fumble for my knife to cut away, 

I just embraced the shaft and rode it out— 

Till Weiss shut off the water in the wheel-pit. 

That’s how I think I didn’t lose my head. 

But my legs got their knocks against the ceiling.’ 

‘Awful. Why didn’t they throw off the belt 
Instead of going clear down in the wheel-pit?’ 

‘They say some time was wasted on the belt— 

Old streak of leather— doesn’t love me much 
Because I make him spit fire at my knuckles, 

The way Ben Franklin used to make the kite-string. 
That must be it. Some days he won’t stay on. 

That day a woman couldn’t coax him off. 

He’s on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth 
Snatched right and left across the silver pulleys. 
Everything goes the same without me there. 

You can hear the small buzz saws whine, the big saw 
Caterwaul to the hills around the village 
As they both bite the wood. It’s all our music. 

One ought as a good villager to like it. 

No doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound, 

And it’s our life.’ 


“Yes, when it’s not our death.’ 

You make that sound as if it wasn’t so 
With everything. What we live by we die by. 

I wonder where my lawyer is. His train’s in. 

I want this over with; I’m hot and tired.’ 

‘You’re getting ready to do something foolish.’ 

[ 118 ] 



Watch for him, will you. Will? You let him in. 

I’d rather Mrs. Corbin didn’t know; 

I’ve boarded here so long, she thinks she owns me. 
You’re bad enough to manage without her.’ 

Tm going to be worse instead of better. 

You’ve got to tell me how far this is gone: 

Have you agreed to any price?’ 


'Five hundred. 

Five hundred— five— five! One, two, three, four, five. 
You needn’t look at me.’ 


‘I don’t believe you.’ 

1 told you, Willis, when you first came in. 

Don’t you be hard on me. I have to take 
What I can get. You see they have the feet, 

Which gives them the advantage in the trade. 

I can’t get back the feet in any case.’ 

'But your flowers, man, you’re selling out your flowers.’ 

Tes, that’s one way to put it— all the flowers 
Of every kind everywhere in this region 
For the next forty summers— call it forty. 

But I’m not selling those, I’m giving them. 

They never earned me so much as one cent: 

Money can’t pay me for the loss of them. 

No, the five hundred was the sum they named 
To pay the doctor’s bill and tide me over. 

It’s that or fight, and I don’t want to fight— 

I just want to get settled in my life, 

[ 119 ] 



Such as it’s going to be, and know the worst, 

Or best— it may not be so bad. The firm 
Promise me all the shooks I want to nail.’ 

‘But what about your flora of the valley?’ 

“You have me there. But that— you didn’t think 
That was worth money to me? Still I own 
It goes against me not to finish it 
For the friends it might bring me. By the way, 

I had a letter from Burroughs— did I tell you?— 
About my Cyprepedium regime; 

He says it’s not reported so far north. 

There! there’s the bell. He’s rung. But you go down 
And bring him up, and don’t let Mrs. Corbin.— 

Oh, well, we’ll soon be through with it. I’m tired.’ 

Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer 
A little barefoot girl who in the noise 
Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house. 

And baritone importance of the lawyer, 

Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands 
Shyly behind her. 


“Well, and how is Mister— 

The lawyer was already in his satchel 
As if for papers that might bear the name 
He hadn’t at command. ‘You must excuse me, 
I dropped in at the mill and was detained.’ 

‘Looking round, I suppose,’ said Willis. 


‘Yes, 


Well, yes.’ 


[ 120 ] 



‘Hear anything that might prove useful?’ 


The Broken One saw Anne. “Why, here is Anne. 

What do you want, dear? Come, stand by the bed; 

Tell me what is it?’ Anne just wagged her dress 
With both hands held behind her. ‘Guess,’ she said. 

‘Oh, guess which hand? My, my! Once on a time 
I knew a lovely way to tell for certain 
By looking in the ears. But I forget it. 

Er, let me see. I think I’ll take the right. 

That’s sure to be right even if it’s wrong. 

Come, hold it out. Don’t change.— A Ram’s Hom orchid! 
A Ram’s Hom! What would I have got, I wonder, 

If I had chosen left. Hold out the left. 

Another Ram’s Hom! Where did you find those. 

Under what beech tree, on what woodchuck’s knoll?’ 

Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side. 

And thought she wouldn’t venture on so much. 

“Were there no others?’ 


‘There were four or five. 

I knew you wouldn’t let me pick them all.’ 

‘I wouldn’t— so I wouldn’t. You’re the girl! 

You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart.’ 

‘I wanted there should be some there next year.’ 

‘Of course you did. You left the rest for seed, 

And for the backwoods woodchuck. You’re the girl! 
A Ram’s Hom orchid seedpod for a woodchuck 

£ 121 ] 



Sounds something like. Better than farmer’s beans 
To a discriminating appetite, 

Though the Ham’s Horn is seldom to be had 
In bushel lots— doesn’t come on the market. 

But, Anne, I’m troubled; have you told me all? 

You’re hiding something. That’s as bad as lying. 

You ask this lawyer man. And it’s not safe 
With a lawyer at hand to find you out. 

Nothing is hidden from some people, Anne. 

You don’t tell me that where you found a Ram’s Horn 
You didn’t find a Yellow Lady’s Slipper. 

What did I tell you? What? I’d blush, I would. 

Don’t you defend yourself. If it was there, 

Where is it now, the Yellow Lady’s Slipper?’ 

Well, wait— it’s common— it’s too common.’ 


‘Common? 

The Purple Lady’s Slipper’s commoner.’ 

‘I didn’t bring a Purple Lady’s Slipper. 

To You — to you I mean— they’re both too common.' 

The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers 
As if with some idea that she had scored. 

Tve broken Anne of gathering bouquets. 

It’s not fair to the child. It can’t be helped though: 
Pressed into service means pressed out of shape. 
Somehow I’ll make it right with her— she’ll see. 

She’s going to do my scouting in the field, 

Over stone walls and all along a wood 
And by a river bank for water flowers. 

The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart, 

[ 122 ] 



And at the sinus under water a fist 
Of little fingers all kept down but one. 

And that thrust up to blossom in the sun 
As if to say, “You! You’re the Heart’s desire.” 

Anne has a way with flowers to take the place 

Of what she’s lost: she goes down on one knee 

And lifts their faces by the chin to hers 

And says their names, and leaves them where they are.’ 

The lawyer wore a watch the case of which 
Was cunningly devised to make a noise 
Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut 
At such a time as this. He snapped it now. 

Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait. 

The lawyer man is thinking of his train. 

He wants to give me lots and lots of money 
Before he goes, because I hurt myself, 

And it may take him I don’t know how long. 

But put our flowers in water first. Will, help her: 

The pitcher’s too full for her. There’s no cup? 

Just hook them on the inside of the pitcher. 

Now run.— Get out your documents! You see 
I have to keep on the good side of Anne. 

I’m a great boy to think of number one. 

And you can’t blame me in the place I’m in. 

Who will take care of my necessities 
Unless I do?’ 


‘A pretty interlude,’ 

The lawyer said. ‘I’m sorry, but my train— 
Luckily terms are all agreed upon. 

You only have to sign your name. Bight— there.’ 

[ 123 ] 



‘You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here 
Where you can’t make them. What is it you want? 
I’ll put you out with Anne. Be good or go.’ 

‘You don’t mean you will sign that thing unread?’ 

‘Make yourself useful then, and read it for me. 
Isn’t it something I have seen before?’ 

‘You’ll find it is. Let your friend look at it.’ 

‘Yes, but all that takes time, and I’m as much 
In haste to get it over with as you. 

But read it, read it. That’s right, draw the curtain: 
Half the time I don’t know what’s troubling me.— 
What do you say. Will? Don’t you be a fool. 

You, crumpling folks’s legal documents. 

Out with it if you’ve any real objection.’ 

‘Five hundred dollars!’ 


What would you think right?* 

‘A thousand wouldn’t be a cent too much; 

You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is 
Accepting anything before he knows 
Whether he’s ever going to walk again. 

It smells to me like a dishonest trick.’ 

‘I think— I think— from what I heard today— 

And saw myself— he would be ill-advised—’ 

What did you hear, for instance?’ Willis said. 

[ 124 ] 



"Now the place where the accident occurred—’ 

The Broken One was twisted in his bed. 

‘This is between you two apparently. 

Where I come in is what I want to know. 

You stand up to it like a pair of cocks. 

Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me. 

When you come back. I’ll have the papers signed. 
Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen. 

One of you hold my head up from the pillow.’ 

Willis flung off the bed. 1 wash my hands— 

I’m no match— no, and don’t pretend to be— ’ 

The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen. 

‘You’re doing the wise thing: you won’t regret it. 
We’re very sorry for you.’ 

Willis sneered: 

‘Who’s weP— some stockholders in Boston? 

I’ll go outdoors, by gad, and won’t come back.’ 

‘Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come. 
Yes. Thanks for caring. Don’t mind Will: he’s savage. 
He th in ks you ought to pay me for my flowers. 

You don’t know what I mean about the flowers. 

Don’t stop to try to now. You’ll miss your train. 
Good-by.’ He flung his arms around his face.

THE WOOD-PILE 


Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day, 

I paused and said, T will ton back from here. 

No, I will go on farther— and we shall see.’ 

The hard snow held me, save where now and then 
One foot went through. The view was all in lines 
Straight up and down of tall slim trees 
Too much alike to mark or name a place by 
So as to say for certain I was here 
Or somewhere else: I was just far from home. 

A small bird flew before me. He was careful 
To put a tree between us when he lighted. 

And say no word to tell me who he was 

Who was so foolish as to think what he thought. 

He thought that I was after him for a feather— 

The white one in his tail; like one who takes 
Everything said as personal to himself. 

One flight out sideways would have undeceived him. 
And then there was a pile of wood for which 
I forgot him and let his little fear 
Carry him off the way I might have gone, 

Without so much as wishing him good-night. 

He went behind it to make his last stand. 

It was a cord of maple, cut and split 

And piled— and measured, four by four by eight. 

And not another like it could I see. 

No runner tracks in this year’s snow looped near it. 
And it was older sure than this year’s cutting. 

Or even last year’s or the year’s before. 

The wood was gray and the bark warping off it 
And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis 
Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle. 
[ 126 ] 



What held it though on one side was a tree 
Still growing, and on one a stake and prop, 
These latter about to fall. I thought that only 
Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks 
Could so forget his handiwork on which 
He spent himself, the labor of his ax, 

And leave it there far from a useful fireplace 
To warm the frozen swamp as best it could 
With the slow smokeless burning of decay. 


f 127] 



GOOD HOURS 


I had for my winter evening walk— 

No one at all with whom to talk, 

But I had the cottages in a row 
Up to their shining eyes in snow. 

And I thought I had the folk within: 

I had the sound of a violin; 

I had a glimpse through curtain laces 
Of youthful forms and youthful faces. 

I had such company outward bound. 

I went till there were no cottages found. 
I tinned and repented, but coming back 
I saw no window but that was black. 

Over the snow my creaking feet 
Disturbed the slumbering village street 
Like profanation, by your leave. 

At ten o’clock of a winter eve. 


[ 128 ] 



MOUNTAIN 

INTERVAL 




THE ROAD NOT TAKEN 


Two roads diverged in a yellow wood. 
And sorry I could not travel both 
And be one traveler, long I stood 
And looked down one as far as I could 
To where it bent in the undergrowth; 

Then took the other, as just as fair. 

And having perhaps the better claim, 
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; 
Though as for that the passing there 
Had worn them really about the same. 

And both that morning equally lay 
In leaves no step had trodden black. 

Oh, I kept the first for another day! 

Yet knowing how way leads on to way, 

I doubted if I should ever come back. 

I shall be telling this with a sigh 
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— 

I took the one less traveled by, 

And that has made all the difference.

CHRISTMAS TREES 


A CHRISTMAS CIRCULAR LETTER 

The city had withdrawn into itself 
And left at last the country to the country; 

When between whirls of snow not come to lie 
And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove 
A stranger to our yard, who looked the city, 

Yet did in country fashion in that there 
He sat and waited till he drew us out 
A -butto nin g coats to ask him who he was. 

He proved to be the city come again 
To look for something it had left behind 
And could not do without and keep its Christmas. 

He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees; 

My woods— the young fir balsams like a place 
Where houses all are churches and have spires. 

I hadn’t thought of them as Christmas trees. 

I doubt if I was tempted for a moment 
To sell them off their feet to go in cars 
And leave the slope behind the house all bare. 
Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon. 
I’d hate to have them know it if I was. 

Yet more I’d hate to hold my trees except 
As others hold theirs or refuse for them, 

Beyond the time of profitable growth. 

The trial by market everything must come to. 

I dallied so much with the thought of selling. 

Then whether from mistaken courtesy 

And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether 

From hope of hearing good of what was mine, 

I said, ‘There aren’t enough to be worth while.’ 

[ 132 ] 



1 could soon tell how many they would cut, 
You let me look them over/ 


‘You could look. 

But don’t expect I’m going to let you have them.’ 
Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close 
That lop each other of boughs, but not a few 
Quite solitary and having equal boughs 
All round and round. The latter he nodded ‘Yes’ to. 
Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one. 

With a buyer’s moderation, ‘That would do.’ 

I thought so too, but wasn’t there to say so. 

We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over. 
And came down on the north. 


He said, ‘A thousand/ 

‘A thousand Christmas trees!— at what apiece?’ 

He felt some need of softening that to me: 

‘A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.’ 

Then I was certain I had never meant 
To let him have them. Never show surprise! 

But thirty dollars seemed so small beside 
The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents 
(For that was all they figured out apiece), 

Three cents so small beside the dollar friends 
I should be writing to within the hour 
Would pay in cities for good trees like those, 

Regular vestry trees whole Sunday Schools 
Could hang enough on to pick off enough. 


[ 133 ] 



A thousand Christmas trees I didn’t know I hadl 
Worth three cents more to give away than sell 
As may be shown by a simple calculation. 

Too bad I couldn’t lay one in a letter. 

I can’t help wishing I could send you one 
In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas. 


[ 134 ] 



AN OLD MAN’S WINTER NIGHT 


All out-of-doors looked darkly in at him 
Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars. 
That gathers on the pane in empty rooms. 

What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze 
Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand. 

What kept him from remembering what it was 
That brought him to that creaking room was age. 
He stood with barrels round him— at a loss. 

And having scared the cellar under him 
In clomping here, he scared it once again 
In clomping off;— and scared the outer night. 
Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar 
Of trees and crack of branches, common things. 
But nothing so like beating on a box. 

A light he was to no one but himself 

Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what, 

A quiet light, and then not even that. 

He consigned to the moon, such as she was, 

So late-arising, to the broken moon 

As better than the sun in any case 

For such a charge, his snow upon the roof, 

His icicles along the wall to keep; 

And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt 
Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted. 
And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept. 
One aged man— one man— can’t keep a house, 

A farm, a countryside, or if he can, 

It’s thus he does it of a winter night. 


[135J 



"the exposed nest 


You were forever finding some new play. 

So when I saw you down on hands and knees 
In the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay. 

Trying, I thought, to set it up on end, 

I went to show you how to make it stay. 

If that was your idea, against the breeze. 

And, if you asked me, even help pretend 
To make it root again and grow afresh. 

But ’twas no make-believe with you today. 

Nor was the grass itself your real concern. 

Though I found your hand full of wilted fern, 
Steel'bright June-grass, and blackening heads of clover. 
’Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground 
The cutter-bar had just gone champing over 
(Miraculously without tasting flesh) 

And left defenseless to the heat and light. 

You wanted to restore them to their right 
Of something interposed between their sight 
And too much world at once— could means be found. 
The way the nest-full every time we stirred 
Stood up to us as to a mother-bird 
Whose coming home has been too long deferred. 

Made mo ask would the mother-bird return 
And care for them in such a change of scene 
And might our meddling make her more afraid. 

That was a thing we could not wait to learn. 

We sa-w the risk we took in doing good, 

But dared not spare to do the best we could 
Though harm should come of it; so built the screen 
You had begun, and gave them back their shade. 

All this to prove we cared. Why is there then 

[ 136 ] 



No more to tell? We turned to other things. 

I haven’t any memory— have you?— 

Of ever coming to the place again 

To see if the birds lived the first night through, 

And so at last to learn to use their wings. 


[ 137 ] 



A PATCH OF OLD SNOW 


There’s a patch of old snow in a comer 
That I should have guessed 
Was a blow-away paper the rain 
Had brought to rest. 

It is speckled with grime as if 
Small print overspread it, 

The news of a day I’ve forgotten— 

If I ever read it. 


[ 138 ] 



IN THE HOME STRETCH 


She stood against the kitchen sink, and looked 
Over the sink out through a dusty window 
At weeds the water from the sink made tall. 

She wore her cape; her hat was in her hand. 

Behind her was confusion in the room, 

Of chairs turned upside down to sit like people 
In other chairs, and something, come to look. 

For every room a house has— parlor, bedroom, 

And dining room— thrown pell-mell in the kitchen. 
And now and then a smudged, infernal face 
Looked in a door behind her and addressed 
Her back. She always answered without turning. 

“Where will 1 put this walnut bureau, lady?' 

Tut it on top of something that’s on top 
Of something else/ she laughed. “Oh, put it where 
You can tonight, and go. It’s almost dark; 

You must be getting started back to town.’ 

Another blackened face thrust in and looked 

And smiled, and when she did not turn, spoke gently, 

“What are you seeing out the window, lady?’ 

‘Never was I beladied so before. 

Would evidence of having been called lady 
More than so many times make me a lady 
In common law, I wonder/ 


‘But I ask, 

What are you seeing out the window, lady?’ 

“What I’ll be seeing more of in the years 
To come as here I stand and go the round 

[ 139 ] 



Of many plates with towels many times.’ 

‘And what is that? You only put me off.’ 

‘Rank weeds that love the water from the dishpan 
More than some women like the dishpan, Joe; 

A little stretch of mowing-field for you; 

Not much of that until I come to woods 
That end all. And it’s scarce enough to call 
A view.’ 


‘And yet you think you like it, dear?’ 

‘That’s what you’re so concerned to know! You hope 
I like it. Bang goes something big away 
Off there upstairs. The very tread of men 
As great as those is shattering to the frame 
Of such a little house. Once left alone. 

You and I, dear, wifi go with softer steps 
Up and down stairs and through the rooms, and none 
But sudden winds that snatch them from our hands 
Will ever slam the doors.’ 


‘I think you see 

More than you like to own to out that window.’ 

‘No; for besides the things I tell you of, 

I only see the years. They come and go 
In alternation with the weeds, the field. 

The wood.’ 


“What kind of years?’ 


[ 140 ] 


‘Why, latter years* 



Different from early years.’ 


'I see them, too. 

You didn’t count them?’ 


‘No, the further off 
So ran together that I didn’t try to. 

It can scarce be that they would be in number 
We’d care to know, for we are not young now. 

And bang goes something else away off there. 

It sounds as if it were the men went down. 

And every crash meant one less to return 
To lighted city streets we, too, have known, 

But now are giving up for country darkness.’ 

‘Come from that window where you see too much. 

And take a livelier view of things from here. 

They’re going. Watch this husky swarming up 
Over the wheel into the sky-high seat. 

Lighting his pipe now, squinting down his nose 
At the flame binning downward as he sucks it.’ 

‘See how it makes his nose-side bright, a proof 
How dark it’s getting. Can you tell what time 
It is by that? Or by the moon? The new moon! 

What shoulder did I see her over? Neither. 

A wire she is of silver, as new as we 
To everything. Her light won’t last us long. 

It’s something, though, to know were going to have her 
Night after night and stronger every night 
To see us through our first two weeks. But, Joe, 

The stove! Before they go! Knock on the window; 

Ask them to help you get it on its feet. 

We stand here dreaming. Hurry! Call them back!’ 

[ 141 ] 



‘They’re not gone yet.’ 

‘We’ve got to have the stove. 
Whatever else we want for. And a light. 

Have we a piece of candle if the lamp 
And oil are buried out of reach?’ 


Again 

The house was full of tramping, and the dark. 
Door-filling men burst in and seized the stove. 

A cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall. 

To which they set it true by eye; and then 
Came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands. 

So much too light and airy for their strength 
It almost seemed to come ballooning up, 

Slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling. 

‘A fit!’ said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder. 

‘It’s good luck when you move in to begin 
With good luck with your stovepipe. Never mind. 

It’s not so bad in the country, settled down, 

When people’re getting on in life. You’ll like it.’ 

Joe said: ‘You big boys ought to find a farm. 

And make good farmers, and leave other fellows 
The city work to do. There’s not enough 
For everybody as it is in there.’ 

‘God!’ one said wildly, and, when no one spoke: 

‘Say that to Jimmy here. He needs a farm.’ 

But Jimmy only made his jaw recede 
Fool-like, and rolled his eyes as if to say 
He saw himself a farmer. Then there was a French boy 
Who said with seriousness that made them laugh, 

‘Ma friend, you ain’t know what it is you’re ask.’ 

He doffed his cap and held it with both hands 
Across his chest to make as ’twere a bow: 

[ 142 ] 



‘Were giving you our chances on de farm.’ 

And then they all turned to with deafening boots 
And put each other bodily out of the house. 

‘Good-by to them! We puzzle them. They think— 

I don’t know what they think we see in what 
They leave us to: that pasture slope that seems 
The back some farm presents us; and your woods 
To northward from your window at the sink, 

Waiting to steal a step on us whenever 
We drop our eyes or turn to other things. 

As in the game “Ten-step” the children play.’ 

‘Good boys they seemed, and let them love the city. 
All they could say was “God!” when you proposed 
Their coming out and making useful farmers.’ 

‘Did they make something lonesome go through you? 
It would take more than them to sicken you— 

Us of our bargain. But they left us so 

As to our fate, like fools past reasoning with. 

They almost shook me’ 


It’s all so much 
What we have always wanted, I confess 
It’s seeming bad for a moment makes it seem 
Even worse still, and so on down, down, down. 
It’s nothing; it’s their leaving us at dusk. 

I never bore it well when people went. 

The first night after guests have gone, the house 
Seems haunted or exposed. I always take 
A personal interest in the locking up 
At bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off.’ 
He fetched a dingy lantern from behind 
A door. ‘There’s that we didn’t lose! And these!’— 

[ 143 ] 



Some matches he unpocketed. ‘For food— 

The meals we’ve had no one can take from us. 

I wish that everything on earth were just 
As certain as the meals we’ve had. I wish 
The meals we haven’t had were, anyway. 

What have you you know where to lay your hands on?’ 

‘The bread we bought in passing at the store. 

There’s butter somewhere, too.’ 


‘Let’s rend the bread. 
I’ll light the fire for company for you; 

You’ll not have any other company 

Till Ed begins to get out on a Sunday 

To look us over and give us his idea 

Of what wants pruning, shingling, breaking up. 

He’ll know what he would do if he were we. 

And all at once. He’ll plan for us and plan 
To help us, but he’ll take it out in planning. 

Well, you can set the table with the loaf. 

Let’s see you find your loaf. I’ll light the fire. 

I like chairs occupying other chairs 
Not offering a lady—’ 


You’re tired’ 


‘There again, Joe! 


‘I’m drunk-nonsensical tired out; 
Don’t mind a word I say. It’s a day’s work 
To empty one house of all household goods 
And fill another with ’em fifteen miles away, 
Although you do no more than dump them down.’ 

‘Dumped down in paradise we are and happy.’ 

[ 144 ] 



‘It’s all so much what I have always wanted, 
I can’t believe it’s what you wanted, too.’ 

'Shouldn’t you like to know?’ 


‘I’d like to know 

If it is what you wanted, then how much 
You wanted it for me.’ 


'A troubled conscience! 
You don’t want me to tell if I don’t know.’ 

‘I don’t want to find” out what can’t be known. 
But who first said the word to come?’ 


'My dear, 

It’s who first thought the thought. You’re searching, Joe, 
For things that don’t exist; I mean beginnings. 

Ends and beginnings— there are no such things. 

There are only middles.’ 


‘What is this?’ 


‘This life? 

Our sitting here by lantern-light together 
Amid the wreckage of a former home? 

You won’t deny the lantern isn’t new. 

The stove is not, and you are not to me. 

Nor I to you.’ 


‘Perhaps you never were?’ 

Tt would take me forever to recite 

All that’s not new in where we find ourselves. 

[ 145 ] 



New is a word for fools in towns who think 
Style upon style in dress and thought at last 
Must get somewhere. I’ve heard you say as much. 
No, this is no beginning.’ 


'Then an end?’ 


'End is a gloomy word.’ 


‘Is it too late 

To drag you out for just a good-night call 
On the old peach trees on the knoll to grope 
By starlight in the grass for a last peach 
The neighbors may not have taken as their right 
When the house wasn’t lived in? I’ve been looking: 
I doubt if they have left us many grapes. 

Before we set ourselves to right the house, 

The first thing in the morning, out we go 
To go the round of apple, cherry, peach, 

Pine, alder, pasture, mowing, well, and brook. 

All of a farm it is.’ 


‘I know this much: 

I’m going to put you in your bed, if first 
I have to make you build it. Come, the light.’ 

When there was no more lantern in the kitchen, 
The fire got out through crannies in the stove 
And danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling, 

As much at home as if they’d always danced there. 


[ 146 ] 



THE TELEPHONE 


“When I was just as far as I could, walk 
From here today, 

There was an hour 
All still 

When leaning with my head against a flower 
I heard you talk. 

Don’t say I didn’t, for I heard you say— 

You spoke from that flower on the window sill — 
Do you remember what it was you said?’ 

‘First tell me what it was you thought you heard.’ 

‘Having found the flower and driven a bee away, 
I leaned my head. 

And holding by the stalk, 

I listened and I thought I caught the word— 
What was it? Did you call me by my name? 

Or did you say— 

Someone said “Come”— I heard it as I bowed.’ 

‘I may have thought as much, but not aloud.’ 
‘Well, so I came.’ 


[ 147 ] 



MEETING AND PASSING 


As I went down the hill along the wall 
There was a gate I had leaned at for the view 
And had just turned from when I first saw you 
As you came up the hill. We met. But all 
We did that day was mingle great and small 
Footprints in summer dust as if we drew 
The figure of our being less than two 
But more than one as yet. Your parasol 
Pointed the decimal off with one deep chrust. 
And all the time we talked you seemed to see 
Something down there to smile at in the dust. 
(Oh, it was without prejudice to me!) 
Afterward I went past what you had passed 
Before we met and you what I had passed. 


[ 148 ] 



HYLA BROOK 


By June our brook’s run out of song and speed 
Sought for much after that, it will be found 
Either to have gone groping underground 
(And taken with it all the Hyla breed 
That shouted in the mist a month ago, 

Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow)— 
Or flourished and come up in jewel-weed, 
Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent 
Even against the way its waters went. 

Its bed is left a faded paper sheet 
Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat— 

A brook to none but who remember long. 

This as it will be seen is other far 

Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song. 

We love the things we love for what they are. 


[ 149 ] 



THE OVEN BIRD 


There is a singer everyone has heard, 

Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird. 

Who makes the solid tree trunks sound ag ain 
He says that leaves are old and that for flowers 
Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten. 

He says the early petal-fall is past 

When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers 

On sunny days a moment overcast; 

And comes that other fall we name the fall. 

He says the highway dust is over all. 

The bird would cease and be as other birds 
But that he knows in singing not to sing. 

The question that he frames in all but words 
Is what to make of a diminished thing. 


[ 150 ] 



BOND AND FREE 


Love has earth to which she clings 
With hills and circling arms about— 

Wall within wall to shut fear out. 

But Thought has need of no such things, 
For Thought has a pair of dauntless wings. 

On snow and sand and turf, I see 
Where Love has left a printed trace 
With straining in the world’s embrace. 

And such is Love and glad to be. 

But Thought has shaken his ankles free. 

Thought cleaves the interstellar gloom 
And sits in Sirius’ disc all night, 

Till day makes him retrace his flight, 

With smell of burning on every plume. 
Back past the sun to an earthly room. 

His gains in heaven are what they are. 

Yet some say Love by being thrall 
And simply staying possesses all 
In several beauty that Thought fares far 
To find fused in another star. 


[ 151 ] 



BIRCHES 


When I see birches bend to left and right 
Across v he lines of straighter darker trees, 

I like to think some boy’s been swinging them. 

But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay 
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them 
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning 
After a rain. They click upon themselves 
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored 
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel. 

Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells 
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust— 

Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away 
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen. 

They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, 
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed 
So low for long, they never right themselves : 

You may see their trunks arching in the woods 
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground 
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair 
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun. 

But I was going to say when Truth broke in 
With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm 
I should prefer to have some boy bend them 
As he went out and in to fetch the cows— 

Some boy too far from town to learn baseball, 

Whose only play was what he found himself. 

Summer or winter, and could play alone. 

One by one he subdued his father’s trees 
By riding them down over and over again 
Until he took the stiffness out of them. 

And not one but hung limp, not one was left 

[1521 



For kim t 0 conquer. He learned all there was 
To learn about not launching out too soon 
And so not carrying the tree away 
Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise 
To the top branches, climbing carefully 
With the same pains you use to fill a cup. 

Up to the brim, and even above ^ a tgiip. 

Then he flung outward, feet first f . ^jith; ) a,|S.wish, 

Kicking his way down through (h&.^i£ to the ground. 
So was I once myself a swinger of birches. 

And so I dream of going back to be. 

It’s when I’m weary of considerations. 

And life is too much like a pathless v^oqd 

Where your face bums and tickles wit^^e cobwebs 

Broken across it, and one eye is weeping 

From a twig’s having lashed across it open 

I’d like to get away from earth awhile 

And then come back to it and begin over. 

May no fate willfully misunderstand me 

And half grant what I wish and snatch me away 

Not to return. Earth’s the right place for love: 

I don’t know where it’s likely to go better. 

I’d like to go by climbing a birch tree, 

And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk 
Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more. 

But dipped its top and set me down again. 

That would be good both going and coming back. 

One could do worse than be a swinger of birches. 


[ 153 ] 



PEA BRUSH 


I walked down alone Sunday after church 
To the place where John has been cutting trees 

To see for myself about the birch 
He said I could have to bush my peas. 

The sun in the new-cut narrow gap 
Was hot enough for the first of May, 

And stifling hot with the odor of sap 

From stumps still bleeding their life away. 

The frogs that were peeping a thousand shrill 
Wherever the ground was low and wet, 

The minute they heard my step went still 
To watch me and see what I came to get. 

Birch boughs enough piled everywhere!— 

All fresh and sound from the recent ax. 

Time someone came with cart and pair 
And got them off the wild flowers’ backs. 

They might be good for garden things 
To curl a little finger round. 

The same as you seize cat’s-cradle strings, 

And lift themselves up off the ground. 

Small good to anything growing wild, 

They were crooking many a trillium 

That had budded before the boughs were piled 
And since it was coming up had to come. 


[ 154 ] 



PUTTING IN THE SEED 


You come to fetch me from my work tonight 
When supper’s on the table, and we’ll see 
If I can leave off burying the white 
Soft petals fallen from the apple tree 
(Soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite, 

Mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea; 
And go along with you ere you lose sight 
Of what you came for and become like me. 

Slave to a springtime passion for the earth. 

How Love burns through the Putting in the Seed 
On through the watching for that early birth 
When, just as the soil tarnishes with weed, 

The sturdy seedling with arched body comes 
Shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs. 


[ 155 ] 



A TIME TO TALK 


When a friend calls to me from the road 
And slows his horse to a meaning walk, 

I don’t stand still and look around 
On all the hills I haven’t hoed, 

And shout from where I am, “What is it?’ 
No, not as there is a time to talk. 

I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground. 
Blade-end up and five feet tall, 

And plod: I go up to the stone wall 
For a friendly visit. 


[ 156 ] 



THE COW IN APPLE TIME 


Something inspires the only cow of late 
To make no more of a wall than an open gate. 

And think no more of wall-builders than fools. 

Her face is flecked with pomace and she drools 
A cider syrup. Having tasted fruit, 

She scorns a pasture withering to the root. 

She runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten 
The windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten. 
She leaves them bitten when she has to fly. 

She bellows on a knoll against the sky. 

Her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry. 


[ 157 ] 



AN ENCOUNTER 


Once on the kind of day called ‘weather breeder,’ 
When the heat slowly hazes and the sun 
By its own power seems to be undone, 

I was half boring through, half climbing through 
A swamp of cedar. Choked with oil of cedar 
And scurf of plants, and weary and over-heated. 
And sorry I ever left the road I knew, 

I paused and rested on a sort of hook 
That had me by the coat as good as seated, 

And since there was no other way to look. 

Looked up toward heaven, and there against the blue. 
Stood over me a resurrected tree, 

A tree that had been down and raised again— 

A barkless specter. He had halted too. 

As if for fear of treading upon me. 

I saw the strange position of his hands— 

Up at his shoulders, dragging yellow strands 
Of wire with something in it from men to men. 

‘You here?’ I said. ‘Where aren’t you nowadays? 

And what’s the news you carry— if you know? 

And tell me where you’re off for— Montreal? 

Me? I’m not off for anywhere at all. 

Sometimes I wander out of beaten ways 
Half looking for the orchid Calypso.’ 


[ 158 ] 



RANGE-FINDING 


The battle rent a cobweb diamond-strung 
And cut a flower beside a ground bird’s nest 
Before it stained a single human breast. 

The stricken flower bent double and so hung. 
And still the bird revisited her young. 

A butterfly its fall had dispossessed 
A moment sought in air his flower of rest, 

Then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung. 
On the bare upland pasture there had spread 
O’ernight ’twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread 
And straining cables wet with silver dew. 

A sudden passing bullet shook it dry. 

The indwelling spider ran to greet the fly, 

But finding nothing, sullenly withdrew. 


[ 159 ] 



THE HILL WIFE 


LONELINESS 

Her Word 

One ought not to have to care 
So much as you and I 

Care when the birds come round the house 
To seem to say good-by; 

Or care so much when they come back 
With whatever it is they sing; 

The truth being we are as much 
Too glad for the one thing 

As we are too sad for the other here- 
with birds that fill their breasts 

But with each other and themselves 
And their built or driven nests. 


HOUSE FEAR 

Always— I tell you this they learned— 

Always at night when they returned 
To the lonely house from far away 
To lamps unlighted and fire gone gray. 

They learned to rattle the lock and key 
To give whatever might chance to be 
Warning and time to be off in flight: 

And preferring the out- to the in-door night, 
They learned to leave the house-door wide 
Until they had lit the lamp inside. 

[ 160 ] 



THE SMILE 

' J Her Word 


I didn’t like the way he went away. 

That smile! It never came of being gay. 

Still he smiled— did you see him?— I was sure! 
Perhaps because we gave him only bread 
And the wretch knew from that that we were poor. 
Perhaps because he let us give instead 
Of seizing from us as he might have seized. 

Perhaps he mocked at us for being wed. 

Or being very young (and he was pleased 
To have a vision of us old and dead). 

I wonder how far down the road he’s got. 

He’s watching from the woods as like as not. 


THE OFT-REPEATED DREAM 

She had no saying dark enough 
For the dark pine that kept 
Forever trying the window-latch 
Of the room where they slept. 

The tireless but ineffectual hands 
That with every futile pass 
Made the great tree seem as a little bird 
Before the mystery of glass! 

It never had been inside the room. 

And only one of the two 
Was afraid in an oft-repeated dream 
Of what the tree might do. 

[ 161 ] 



THE IMPULSE 


It was too lonely for her there, 

And too wild, 

And since there were but two of them, 
And no child, 

And work was little in the house. 

She was free, 

And followed where he furrowed field, 
Or felled tree. 

She rested on a log and tossed 
The fresh chips, 

With a song only to herself 
On her lips. 

And once she went to break a bough 
Of black alder. 

She strayed so far she scarcely heard 
When he called her— 

And didn’t answer— didn’t speak— 

Or return. 

She stood, and then she ran and hid 
In the fern. 

He never found her, though he looked 
Everywhere, 

And he asked at her mother’s house 
Was she there. 

Sudden and swift and light as that 
The ties gave, 

And he learned of finalities 
Besides the grave. 

[1621 



THE BONFIRE 


‘Oh, let s go up the hill and scare ourselves. 

As reckless as the best of them tonight. 

By setting fire to all the brush we piled 
With pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow. 

Oh, let’s not wait for rain to make it safe. 

The pile is ours: we dragged it bough on bough 
Down dark converging paths between the pines. 
Let’s not care what we do with it tonight. 

Divide it? No! But bum it as one pile 
The way we piled it. And let’s be the talk 
Of people brought to windows by a light 
Thrown from somewhere against their wallpaper. 
Rouse them all, both the free and not so free 
With saying what they’d like to do to us 
For what they’d better wait till we have done. 

Let’s all but bring to life this old volcano, 

If that is what the mountain ever was— 

And scare ourselves. Let wild fire loose we will . . 

‘And scare you too?’ the children said together. 

‘Why wouldn’t it scare me to have a fire 
Begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know 
That still, if I repent, I may recall it, 

But in a moment not: a little spurt 

Of burning fatness, and then nothing but 

The fire itself can put it out, and that 

By burning out, and before it bums out 

It will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars 

And sweeping round it with a flaming sword, 

Made the dim trees stand back in wider circle— 
Done so much and I know not how much more 

[ 163 ] 



I mean it shall not do if I can bind it. 

Well if it doesn’t with its draft bring on 
A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter. 

As once it did with me upon an April. 

The breezes were so spent with winter blowing 
They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them 
Short of the perch their languid flight was toward 
And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven 
As I walked once around it in possession. 

But the wind out of doors— you know the saying. 
There came a gust. You used to think the trees 
Made wind by fanning since you never knew 
It blow but that you saw the trees in motion. 
Something or someone watching made that gust. 

It put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass 
Of over-winter with the least tip-touch 
Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand. 

The place it reached to blackened instantly. 

The black was almost all there was by daylight, 

That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke— 

And a flame slender as the hepaticas, 

Blood-root, and violets so soon to be now. 

But the black spread like black death on the ground, 
And I think the sky darkened with a cloud 
Like winter and evening coming on together. 

There were enough things to be thought of then. 
Where the field stretches toward the north 
And setting sun to Hyla brook, I gave it 
To flames without twice thinking, where it verges 
Upon the road, to flames too, though in fear 
They might find fuel there, in withered brake. 

Grass its full length, old silver goldenrod. 

And alder and grape vine entanglement, 

[ 164 ] 



To leap the dusty deadline. For my own 
I took what front there was beside. I knelt 
And thrust hands in and held my face away. 

Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating. 

A board is the best weapon if you have it. 

I had my coat. And oh, I knew, I knew, 

And said out loud, I couldn’t bide the smother 
And heat so close in; but the thought of all 
The woods and town on fire by me, and all 
The town turned out to fight for me— that held me. 

I trusted the brook barrier, but feared 
The road would fail; and on that side the fire 
Died not without a noise of crackling wood— 

Of something more than tinder-grass and weed— 

That brought me to my feet to hold it back 
By leaning back myself, as if the reins 
Were round my neck and I was at the plow. 

I won! But I’m sure no one ever spread 
Another color over a tenth the space 
That I spread coal-black over in the time 
It took me. Neighbors coming home from town 
Couldn’t believe that so much black had come there 
While they had backs turned, that it hadn’t been there 
When they had passed an hour or so before 
Going the other way and they not seen it. 

They looked about for someone to have done it. 

But there was no one. I was somewhere wondering 
Where all my weariness had gone and why 
I walked so light on air in heavy shoes 
In spite of a scorched Fourth-of-July feeling. 

Why wouldn’t I be scared remembering that?’ 

‘If it scares you, what will it do to us?’ 

[ 165 ] 



‘Scare you. But if you shrink from being scared. 

What would you say to war if it should come? 

That’s what for reasons I should like to know— 

If you can comfort me by any answer.’ 

‘Oh, but war’s not for children— it’s for men.’ 

‘Now we are digging almost down to China. 

My dears, my dears, you thought that— we all thought it. 
So your mistake was ours. Haven’t you heard, though, 
About the ships where war has found them out 
At sea, about the towns where war has come 
Through opening clouds at night with droning speed 
Further o’erhead than all but stars and angels,— 

And children in the ships and in the towns? 

Haven’t you heard what we have lived to leam? 

Nothing so new— something we had forgotten: 

War is for everyone, for children too. 

I wasn’t going to tell you and I mustn’t. 

The best way is to come up hill with me 
And have our fire and laugh and be afraid.’ 


[ 366 ] 



A GIRL’S GARDEN 


A neighbor of mine in the village 
Likes to tell how one spring 

When she was a girl on the farm, she did 
A childlike thing. 

One day she asked her father 
To give her a garden plot 

To plant and tend and reap herself, 

And he said, ‘Why not?’ 

In casting about for a corner 
He thought of an idle bit 

Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood. 
And he said, ‘Just it.’ 

And he said, ‘That ought to make you 
An ideal one-girl farm. 

And give you a chance to put some strength 
On your slim-jim arm.’ 

It was not enough of a garden, 

Her father said, to plow; 

So she had to work it all by hand, 

But she don’t mind now. 

She wheeled the dung in the wheelbarrow 
Along a stretch of road; 

But she always ran away and left 
Her not-nice load, 

And hid from anyone passing. 

And then she begged the seed. 

[ 167 ] 



She says she thinks she planted one 
Of all things but weed. 

A hill each of potatoes, 

Radishes, lettuce, peas, 

Tomatoes, beets, beans, pumpkins, com 
And even fruit trees. 

And yes, she has long mistrusted 
That a cider apple tree 

In bearing there today is hers, 

Or at least may be. 

Her crop was a miscellany 
When all was said and done, 

A little bit of everything, 

A great deal of none. 

Now when she sees in the village 
How village things go, 

Just when it seems to come in right. 

She says, T know! 

‘It’s as when I was a farmer—’ 

Oh, never by way of advice! 

And she never sins by telling the tale 
To the same person twice. 


[ 168 ] 



LOCKED OUT 


AS TOLD TO A CHILD 

When we locked up the house at night, 

We always locked the flowers outside 
And cut them off from window light. 

The time I dreamed the door was tried 
And brushed with buttons upon sleeves, 
The flowers were out there with the thieves. 
Yet nobody molested them! 

We did find one nasturtium 
Upon the steps with bitten stem. 

I may have been to blame for that: 

I always thought it must have been 
Some flower I played with as I sat 
At dusk to watch the moon down early. 


[ 169 ] 



THE LAST WORD OF A BLUEBIRD 

AS TOLD TO A CHILD 

As I went out a Crow 
In a low voice said, ‘Oh, 

I was looking for you. 

How do you do? 

I just came to tell you 
To tell Lesley (will you?) 

That her little Bluebird 
Wanted me to bring word 
That the north wind last night 
That made the stars bright 
And made ice on the trough 
Almost made him cough 
His tail feathers ofF. 

He just had to fly! 

But he sent her Good-by, 

And said to be good, 

And wear her red hood, 

And look for skunk tracks 
In the snow with an ax— 

And do everything! 

And perhaps in the spring 
He would come back and sing.’ 


[ 170 ] 



‘OUT, OUT-’ 


The buzz saw snarled and rattled in the yard 

And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood, 

Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it. 

And from there those that lifted eyes could count 
Five mountain ranges one behind the other 
Under the sunset far into Vermont. 

And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled, 

As it ran light, or had to bear a load. 

And nothing happened: day was all but done. 

Call it a day, I wish they might have said 
To please the boy by giving him the half hour 
That a boy counts so much when saved from work. 

His sister stood beside them in her apron 
To tell them ‘Supper.’ At the word, the saw. 

As if to prove saws knew what supper meant. 

Leaped out at the boy’s hand, or seemed to leap— 

He must have given the hand. However it was. 

Neither refused the meeting. But the hand! 

The boy’s first outcry was a rueful laugh. 

As he swung toward them holding up the hand 

Half in appeal, but half as if to keep 

The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all— 

Since he was old enough to know, big boy 
Doing a man’s work, though a child at heart— 

He saw all spoiled. ‘Don’t let him cut my hand off— 

The doctor, when he comes. Don’t let him, sister!’ 

So. But the hand was gone already. 

The doctor put him in the dark of ether. 

He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath. 

And then— the watcher at his pulse took fright. 

No one believed. They listened at his heart. 

[ 171 ] 



Little— less— nothing!— and that ended it. 

No more to build on there. And they, since they 
Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs. 


[ 172 ] 



BROWN’S DESCENT 
or 

THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE 

Brown lived at such a lofty farm 
That everyone for miles could see 
His lantern when he did his chores 
In winter after half-past three. 

And many must have seen him make 
His wild descent from there one night, 
’Cross lots, ’cross walls, ’cross everything. 
Describing rings of lantern light. 

Between the house and barn the gale 
Got him by something he had on 
And blew him out on the icy crust 

That cased the world, and he was gone! 

Walls were all buried, trees were few: 

He saw no stay unless he stove 
A hole in somewhere with his heel. 

But though repeatedly he strove 

And stamped and said things to himself, 

And sometimes something seemed to yield. 
He gained no foothold, but pursued 
His journey down from field to field. 

Sometimes he came with arms outspread 
Like wings, revolving in the scene 
Upon his longer axis, and 
With no small dignity of mien. 

[ 173 ] 



Faster or slower as he chanced, 

Sitting or standing as he chose. 

According as he feared to risk 

His neck, or thought to spare his clothes. 

He never let the lantern drop. 

And some exclaimed who saw afar 
The figures he described with it, 

‘I wonder what those signals are 

‘Brown makes at such an hour of night I 
He’s celebrating something strange. 

I wonder if he’s sold his farm. 

Or been made Master of the Grange/ 

He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked; 

He fell and made the lantern rattle 
(But saved the light from going out.) 

So halfway down he fought the battle. 

Incredulous of his own bad luck. 

And then becoming reconciled 
To everything, he gave it up 

And came down like a coasting child. 

‘Well— I— be— ’ that was all he said, 

As standing in the river road, 

He looked back up the slippery slope 
(Two miles it was) to his abode. 

Sometimes as an authority 
On motor-cars, I’m asked if I 
Should say our stock was petered out. 

And this is my sincere reply: 

[ 174 ] 



Yankees are what they always were. 

Don’t think Brown ever gave up hope 
Of getting home again because 
He couldn’t climb that slippery slope; 

Or even thought of standing there 
Until the January thaw 
Should take the polish off the crust. 

He bowed with grace to natural law, 

And then went round it on his feet, 

After the manner of our stock; 

Not much concerned for those to whom. 
At that particular time o’clock. 

It must have looked as if the course 
He steered was really straight away 
From that which he was headed for— 
Not much concerned for them, I say; 

No more so than became a man— 

And politician at odd seasons. 

I’ve kept Brown standing in the cold 
While I invested him with reasons; 

But now he snapped his eyes three times; 

Then shook his lantern, saying, Tie’s 
’Bout out!’ and took the long way home 
By road, a matter of several miles. 


[ 175 ] 



THE GUM-GATHERER 


There overtook me and drew me in 
To his down-hill, early-morning stride, 

And set me five miles on my road 
Better than if he had had me ride, 

A man with a swinging bag for load 
And half the bag wound round his hand. 
We talked like barking above the din 
Of water we walked along beside. 

And for my telling him where I’d been 
And where I lived in mountain land 
To be coming home the way I was, 

He told me a little about himself. 

He came from higher up in the pass 
Where the grist of the new-beginning brooks 
Is blocks split off the mountain mass— 

And hopeless grist enough it looks 
Ever to grind to soil for grass. 

(The way it is will do for moss.) 

There he had built his stolen shack. 

It had to be a stolen shack 
Because of the fears of fire and loss 
That trouble the sleep of lumber folk: 
Visions of half the world burned black 
And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke. 

We know who when they come to town 
Bring berries under the wagon seat. 

Or a basket of eggs between their feet; 

What this man brought in a cotton sack 
Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce. 
He showed me lumps of the scented stuff 
Like uncut jewels, dull and rough. 

[ 176 ] 



It comes to market golden brown; 

But turns to pink between the teeth. 

I told him this is a pleasant life 
To set your breast to the bark of trees 
That all your days are dim beneath, 

And reaching up with a little knife. 

To loose the resin and take it down 
And bring it to market when you please. 


[ 177 ] 



THE LINE-GANG 


Here come the line-gang pioneering by. 

They throw a forest down less cut than broken. 
They plant dead trees for living, and the dead 
They string together with a living thread. 

They string an instrument against the sky 
Wherein words whether beaten out or spoken 
Will run as hushed as when they were a thought 
But in no hush they string it: they go past 
With shouts afar to pull the cable taut, 

To hold it hard until they make it fast, 

To ease away— they have it. With a laugh, 

An oath of towns that set the wild at naught 
They bring the telephone and telegraph. 


[ 178 ] 



THE VANISHING RED 


He is said to have been the last Red Man 
In Acton. And the Miller is said to have laughed— 

If you like to call such a sound a laugh. 

But he gave no one else a laugher’s license. 

For he turned suddenly grave as if to say, 

‘Whose business,— if I take it on myself, 

Whose business— but why talk round the barn?— 

When it’s just that I hold with getting a thing done with. 
You can’t get back and see it as he saw it. 

It’s too long a story to go into now. 

You’d have to have been there and lived it. 

Then you wouldn’t have looked on it as just a matter 
Of who began it between the two races. 

Some guttural exclamation of surprise 
The Red Man gave in poking about the mill 
Over the great big thumping shuffling millstone 
Disgusted the Miller physically as coming 
From one who had no right to be heard from. 

‘Come, John,’ he said, ‘you want to see the wheel-pit?’ 

He took him down below a cramping rafter. 

And showed him, through a manhole in the floor. 

The water in desperate straits like frantic fish, 

Salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails. 

Then he shut down the trap door with a ring in it 
That jangled even above the general noise, 

And came upstairs alone— and gave that laugh, 

And said something to a man with a meal-sack 
That the man with the meal-sack didn’t catch— then. 

Oh, yes, he showed John the wheel-pit all right. 

[ 179 ] 



SNOW 


The three stood listening to a fresh access 
Of wind that caught against the house a moment. 
Gulped snow, and then blew free again— the Coles 
Dressed, but disheveled from some hours of sleep, 
Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore. 

Meserve was first to speak. He pointed backward 
Over his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying, 

‘You can just see it glancing off the roof 
Making a great scroll upward toward the sky. 

Long enough for recording all our names on.— 

I think I’ll just call up my wife and tell her 
I’m here— so far— and starting on again. 

I’ll call her softly so that if she’s wise 

And gone to sleep, she needn’t wake to answer/ 

Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened. 
Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I’m at Cole’s. I’m late. 

I called you up to say Good-night from here 
Before I went to say Good-morning there.— 

I thought I would.— I know, but, Lett— I know— 

I could, but what’s the sense? The rest won’t be 
So bad.— Give me an hour for it.— Ho, ho. 

Three hours to here! But that was all up hill; 

The rest is down.— Why no, no, not a wallow: 

They kept their heads and took their time to it 
Like darlings, both of them. They’re in the bam.— 
My dear. I’m coming just the same. I didn’t 
Call you to ask you to invite me home.—’ 

He lingered for some word she wouldn’t say. 

Said it at last himself, ‘Good-night,’ and then 
Getting no answer, closed the telephone. 

[ 180 ] 



The three stood in the lamplight round the table 
With lowered eyes a moment till he said, 

‘I’ll just see how the horses are.’ 

‘Yes, do,’ 

Both the Coles said together. Mrs. Cole 
Added: ‘You can judge better after seeing — 

I want you here with me, Fred. Leave him here, 
Brother Meserve. You know to find your way 
Out through the shed.’ 

‘I guess I know my way, 

I guess I know where I can find my name 
Carved in the shed to tell me who I am 
If it don’t tell me where I am. I used 
To play—’ 

‘You tend your horses and come back. 
Fred Cole, you’re going to let him!’ 

‘Well, aren’t you 

How can you help yourself?’ 

‘I called him Brother. 

Why did I call him that?’ 


‘It’s right enough. 

That’s all you ever heard him called round here. 
He seems to have lost off his Christian name.’ 

‘Christian enough I should call that myself. 

He took no notice, did he? Well, at least 
I didn’t use it out of love of him, 

The dear knows. I detest the thought of him 
With his ten children under ten years old. 

[ 181 ] 



I hate his wretched little Racker Sect, 

All’s ever I heard of it, which isn’t much. 

But that’s not saying— Look, Fred Cole, it's twelve. 
Isn’t it, now? He’s been here half an hour. 

He says he left the village store at nine. 

Three hours to do four miles— a mile an hour 
Or not much better. Why, it doesn’t seem 
As if a man could move that slow and move. 

Try to think what he did with all that time. 

And three miles more to go!’ 


‘Don’t let him go. 

Stick to him, Helen. Make him answer you. 

That sort of man talks straight on all his life 
From the last thing he said himself, stone deaf 
To anything anyone else may say. 

I should have thought, though, you could make him hear you.’ 

“What is he doing out a night like this? 

Why can’t he stay at home?’ 


‘He had to preach.’ 


‘It’s no night to be out.’ 


‘He may be small. 

He may be good, but one thing’s sure, he’s tough.’ 
‘And strong of stale tobacco.’ 


‘Hell pull through.’ 

‘You only say so. Not another house 
Or shelter to put into from this place 

[ 182 ] 



To theirs. I’m going to call his wife again.’ 

“Wait and he may. Let’s see wiiat he will dc 
Let’s see if he will think of her again. 

But then I doubt he’s thinking of himself. 
He doesn’t look on it as anything.’ 

‘He shan’t go— there!’ 


‘It is a night, my dear. 

‘One thing: he didn’t drag God into it.’ 

‘He don’t consider it a case for God.’ 

‘You think so, do you? You don’t know the kind. 
He’s getting up a miracle this minute. 
Privately— to himself, right now, he’s thinking 
He’ll make a case of it if he succeeds, 

But keep still if he fails.’ 


‘Keep still all over. 
He’ll be dead— dead and buried.’ 


‘Such a trouble! 

Not but I’ve every reason not to care 
What happens to him if it only takes 
Some of the sanctimonious conceit 
Out of one of those pious scalawags.’ 

‘Nonsense to that! You want to see him safe.’ 

“You like the runt.’ 

[ 183 ] 



‘Don’t you a little?’ 


‘Well, 

I don’t like what he’s doing, which is what 
You like, and like him for.’ 


‘Oh, yes you do. 

You like your fun as well as anyone; 

Only you women have to put these airs on 
To impress men. You’ve got us so ashamed 
Of being men we can’t look at a good fight 
Between two boys and not feel bound to stop it. 
Let the man freeze an ear or two, I say.— 

He’s here. I leave him all to you. Go in 
And save his life.— All right, come in, Meserve. 

Sit down, sit down. How did you find the horses?’ 

‘Fine, fine.’ 


‘And ready for some more? My wife here 
Says it won’t do. You’ve got to give it up.' 

‘Won’t you to please me? Please! If I say please? 

Mr. Meserve, I’ll leave it to your wife. 

What did your wife say on the telephone?’ 

Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp 
Or something not far from it on the table. 

By straightening out and lifting a forefinger, 

He pointed with his hand from where it lay 
Like a white crumpled spider on his knee: 

‘That leaf there in your open book! It moved 
Just then, I thought. It’s stood erect like that, 

[ 184 ] 



There on the table, ever since I came, 

Trying to turn itself backward or forward, 

I’ve had my eye on it to make out which; 

If forward, then it’s with a friend’s impatience— 

You see I know— to get you on to things 
It wants to see how you will take, if backward 
It’s from regret for something you have passed 
And failed to see the good of. Never mind, 

Things must expect to come in front of us 
A many times— I don’t say just how many— 

That varies with the things— before we see them. 

One of the lies would make it out that nothing 
Ever presents itself before us twice. 

Where would we be at last if that were so? 

Our very life depends on everything’s 
Recurring till we answer from within. 

The thousandth time may prove the charm.— That leaf! 
It can’t turn either way. It needs the wind’s help. 

But the wind didn’t move it if it moved. 

It moved itself. The wind’s at naught in here. 

It couldn’t stir so sensitively poised 
A thing as that. It couldn’t reach the lamp 
To get a puff of black smoke from the flame. 

Or blow a rumple in the collie’s coat. 

You make a little foursquare block of air, 

Quiet and light and warm, in spite of all 
The illim itable dark and cold and storm. 

And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog, 

And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose; 

Though for all anyone can tell, repose 
May be the thing you haven’t, yet you give it. 

So false it is that what we haven’t we can’t give; 

So false, that what we always say is true. 

[ 185 ] 



I’ll have to turn the leaf if no one else will. 

It won’t lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?’ 

T shouldn’t want to hurry you, Meserve, 

But if you’re going— say you’ll stay, you know. 

But let me raise this curtain on a scene. 

And show you how it’s piling up against you. 

You see the snow-white through the white of frost? 
Ask Helen how far up the sash it’s climbed 
Since last we read the gauge.’ 


‘It looks as if 

Some pallid thing had squashed its features flat 
And its eyes shut with overeagerness 
To see what people found so interesting 
In one another, and had gone to sleep 
Of its own stupid lack of understanding, 

Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff 
Short off, and died against the window-pane.’ 

‘Brother Meserve, take care, you’ll scare yourself 
More than you will us with such nightmare talk. 
It’s you it matters to, because it’s you 
Who have to go out into it alone.’ 

‘Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he’ll stay.’ 

‘Before you drop the curtain— I’m reminded: 

You recollect the boy who came out here 
To breathe the air one winter— had a room 
Down at the Averys’? Well, one sunny morning 
After a downy storm, he passed our place 
And found me banking up the house with snow. 
And I was burrowing in deep for warmth, 

[ 186 ] 



p ilin g it well above the window-sills. 

The snow against the window caught his eye. 

“Hey, that’s a pretty thought”— those were his words. 
“So you can think it’s six feet deep outside. 

While you sit warm and read up balanced rations. 
You can’t get too much winter in the winter.” 

Those were his words. And he went home and all 
But banked the daylight out of Avery’s windows. 
Now you and I would go to no such length. 

At the same time you can’t deny it makes 
It not a mite worse, sitting here, we three. 

Playing our fancy, to have the snowline run 

So high across the pane outside. There where 

There is a sort of tunnel in the frost 

More like a tunnel than a hole— way down 

At the far end of it you see a stir 

And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift 

Blown in the wind. I like that— I like that. 

Well, now I leave you, people.’ 

‘Come, Meserve, 

We thought you were deciding not to go— 

The ways you found to say the praise of comfort 
And being where you are. You want to stay.’ 

Til own it’s cold for such a fall of snow. 

This house is frozen brittle, all except 
This room you sit in. If you think the wind 
Sounds further off, it’s not because it’s dying; 

You’re further under in the snow— that’s all— 

And feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust 
It bursts against us at the chimney mouth, 

And at the eaves. I like it from inside 
More than I shall out in it. But the horses 

ri87] 



Are rested and it’s time to say good-night, 

And let you get to bed again. Cood-night, 

Sorry I had to break in on your sleep.’ 

‘Lucky for you you did. Lucky for you 
You had us for a halfway station 
To stop at. If you were the kind of man 
Paid heed to women, you’d take my advice 
And for your family’s sake stay where you are. 
But what good is my saying it over and over? 
You’ve done more than you had a right to think 
You could do— now. You know the risk you take 
In going on.’ 


‘Our snow-storms as a rule 
Aren’t looked on as man-killers, and although 
I’d rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep 
Under it all, his door sealed up and lost. 

Than the man fighting it to keep above it. 

Yet think of the small birds at roost and not 
In nests. Shall I be counted less than they are? 

Their bulk in water would be frozen rock 
In no time out tonight. And yet tomorrow 
They will come budding boughs from tree to tree 
Flirting their wings and saying' Chickadee, 

As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm.’ 

‘But why when no one wants you to go on? 

Your wife— she doesn’t want you to. We don’t, 

And you yourself don’t want to. Who else is there?’ 

‘Save us from being cornered by a woman. 

Well, there’s—’ She told Fred afterward that in 
The pause right there, she thought the dreaded word 

[ 188 ] 



Was coming, ‘God.’ But no, he only said, 

“Well, there’s— the storm. That says I must go on. 
That wants me as a war might if it came. 

Ask any man.’ 


He threw her that as something 
To last her till he got outside the door. 

He had Cole with him to the bam to see him off. 
When Cole returned he found his wife still standing 
Beside the table near the open book. 

Not reading it. 


‘Well, what kind of a man 
Do you call that?’ she said. 


‘He had the gift 

Of words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?’ 

‘Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?’ 

‘Or disregarding people’s civil questions— 

What? We’ve found out in one hour more about him 
Than we had seeing him pass by in the road 
A thousand times. If that’s the way he preaches! 

You didn’t think you’d keep him after all. 

Oh, I’m not blaming you. He didn’t leave you 
Much say in the matter, and I’m just as glad 
Were not in for a night of him. No sleep 
If he had stayed. The least thing set him going. 

It’s quiet as an empty church without him.’ 

‘But how much better off are we as it is? 

We’ll have to sit here till we know he’s safe.’ 

“Yes, I suppose you’ll want to, but I shouldn’t. 

[ 189 ] 



He knows what he can do, or he wouldn’t try. 
Get into bed I say, and get some rest. 

He won’t come back, and if he telephones, 

It won’t be for an hour or two.’ 


Well then. 

We can’t be any help by sitting here 

And living his fight through with him, I suppose. 5 


Cole had been telephoning in the dark. 
Mrs. Cole’s voice came from an inner room: 
’Did she call you or you call her?’ 


‘She me. 

You’d better dress: you won’t go back to bed. 

We must have been asleep: it’s three and after.’ 

‘Had she been ringing long? I’ll get my wrapper. 
I want to speak to her.’ 


‘All she said was. 

He hadn’t come and had he really started.’ 

‘She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago.’ 

‘He had the shovel. He’ll have made a fight.’ 

Why did I ever let him leave this house!’ 

‘Don’t begin that. You did the best you could 
To keep him— though perhaps you didn’t quite 
Conceal a wish to see him show the spunk 
To disobey you. Much his wife’ll thank you.’ 

[ 190 ] 



‘Fred, after all I said! You shan’t make out 
That it was any way but what it was. 

Did she let on by any word she said 
She didn’t thank me?’ 


‘When I told her “Gone,” 

“Well then,” she said, and ‘Well then”— like a threat. 
And then her voice came scraping slow: “Oh, you. 
Why did you let him go?” ’ 


‘Asked why we let him? 
You let me there. I’ll ask her why she let him. 

She didn’t dare to speak when he was here. 

Their number’s— twenty-one? The thing won’t work. 
Someone’s receiver’s down. The handle stumbles. 

The stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm! 

It’s theirs. She’s dropped it from her hand and gone. 

Try speaking. Say “Hello!”’ 


‘Hello. Hello.’ 


What do you hear?’ 


‘I hear an empty room— 

You know— it sounds that way. And yes, I hear— 
I think I hear a clock— and windows rattling. 

No step though. If she’s there she’s sitting down.’ 

‘Shout, she may hear you.’ 


‘Shouting is no good.’ 


“Keep speaking then.’ 


[ 191 ] 



‘Hello. Hello. Hello. 

You don’t suppose—? She wouldn’t go outdoors?’ 
‘I’m half afraid that’s just what she might do.’ 
‘And leave the children?’ 


‘Wait and call again. 

You can’t hear whether she has left the door 
Wide open and the wind’s blown out the lamp 
And the fire’s died and the room’s dark and cold?’ 

‘One of two things, either she’s gone to bed 
Or gone outdoors.’ 


‘In which case both are lost. 

Do you know what she’s like? Have you ever met her? 

It’s strange she doesn’t want to speak to us.’ 

‘Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come.’ 

‘A clock maybe.’ 


‘Don’t you hear something else?’ 

‘Not talking.’ 


‘No.’ 


Why, yes, I hear— what is it?’ 
What do you say it is?’ 


‘A baby’s crying! 

Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off. 

[ 192 ] 



Its mother wouldn’t let it cry like that. 
Not if she’s there.’ 


‘What do you make of it?' 

'There’s only one thing possible to make, 

That is, assuming— that she has gone out. 

Of course she hasn’t though.’ They both sat down 
Helpless. ‘There’s nothing we can do till morning.’ 

‘Fred, I shan’t let you think of going out.’ 

‘Hold on.’ The double bell began to chirp. 

They started up. Fred took the telephone. 

‘Hello, Meserve. You’re there, then!— And your wife? 
Good! Why I asked— she didn’t seem to answer. 

He says she went to let him in the bam.— 

We’re glad. Oh, say no more about it, man. 

Drop in and see us when you’re passing.’ 


‘Well, 

She has him then, though what she wants him for 
I don’t see.’ 


‘Possibly not for herself. 

Maybe she only wants him for the children.’ 

‘The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing. 
What spoiled our night was to him just his fun. 
What did he come in for?— To talk and visit? 
Thought he’d just call to tell us it was snowing. 

If he thinks he is going to make our house 
A halfway coffee house ’twixt town and nowhere—’ 

[ 193 ] 



T thought you’d feel you’d been too much concerned/ 

‘You think you haven’t been concerned yourself.’ 

If you mean he was inconsiderate 
To rout us out to think for him at midnight 
And then take our advice no more than nothing, 
Why, I agree with you. But let’s forgive him. 

We’ve had a share in one night of his life. 

What’ll you bet he ever calls again?’ 


[ 194 ] 



THE SOUND OF TREES 


I wonder about the trees. 

Why do we wish to bear 
Forever the noise of these 
More than another noise 
So close to our dwelling place? 

We suffer them by the day 
Till we lose all measure of pace, 

And fixity in our joys, 

And acquire a listening air. 

They are that that talks of going 
But never gets away; 

And that talks no less for knowing. 
As it grows wiser and older, 

That now it means to stay. 

My feet tug at the floor 
And my head sways to my shoulder 
Sometimes when I watch trees sway, 
From the window or the door. 

I shall set forth for somewhere, 

I shall make the reckless choice 
Some day when they are in voice 
And tossing so as to scare 
The white clouds over them on. 

I shall have less to say. 

But I shall be gone. 


[ 195 ] 




NEW 

HAMPSHIRE 




NEW HAMPSHIRE 


I met a lady from the South who said 
(You won’t believe she said it, but she said it): 
‘None of my family ever worked, or had 
A thing to sell.’ I don’t suppose the work 
Much matters. You may work for all of me. 

I’ve seen the time I’ve had to work myself. 

The having anything to sell is what 
Is the disgrace in man or state or nation. 

I met a traveler from Arkansas 
Who boasted of his state as beautiful 
For diamonds and apples. ‘Diamonds 
And apples in commercial quantities? 

I asked him, on my guard. ‘Oh, yes,’ he answered. 
Off his. The time was evening in the Pullman. 

‘I see the porter’s made your bed,’ I told him. 

I met a Californian who would 
Talk California— a state so blessed. 

He said, in climate, none had ever died there 
A natural death, and Vigilance Committees 
Had had to organize to stock the graveyards 
And vindicate the state’s humanity. 

‘Just the way Stefansson runs on,’ I murmured, 
‘About the British Arctic. That’s what comes 
Of being in the market with a climate. 

I met a poet from another state, 

A zealot full of fluid inspiration, 

Who in the name of fluid inspiration, 

But in the best style of bad salesmanship, 

[ 199 ] 



Angrily tried to make me write a protest 
(In verse I think) against the Volstead Act. 

He didn’t even offer me a drink 
Until I asked for one to steady him. 

This is called having an idea to sell. 

It never could have happened in New Hampshire. 

The only person really soiled with trade 
I ever stumbled on in old New Hampshire 
Was someone who had just come back ashamed 
From selling things in California. 

He’d built a noble mansard roof with balls 

On turrets like Constantinople, deep 

In woods some ten miles from a railroad station. 

As if to put forever out of mind 

The hope of being, as we say, received. 

I found him standing at the close of day 
Inside the threshold of his open bam, 

Like a lone actor on a gloomy stage— 

And recognized him through the iron gray 
In which his face was muffled to the eyes 
As an old boyhood friend, and once indeed 
A drover with me on the road to Brighton. 

His farm was ‘grounds,’ and not a farm at all; 

His house among the local sheds and shanties 
Rose like a factor’s at a trading station. 

And he was rich, and I was still a rascal. 

I couldn’t keep from asking impolitely. 

Where had he been and what had he been doing? 
How did he get so? (Rich was understood.) 

In dealing in ‘old rags’ in San Francisco. 

Oh, it was terrible as well could be. 

We both of us turned over in our graves. 

[2001 



Just specimens is all New Hampshire has, 

One each of everything as in a show-case 
Which naturally she doesn’t care to sell. 

She had one President (pronounce him Purse, 

And make the most of it for better or worse. 

He’s your one chance to score against the state). 
She had one Daniel Webster. He was all 
The Daniel Webster ever was or shall be. 

She had the Dartmouth needed to produce him. 

I call her old. She has one family 
Whose claim is good to being settled here 
Before the era of colonization, 

And before that of exploration even. 

John Smith remarked them as he coasted by 
Dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf 
At the Isles of Shoals, and satisfied himself 
They weren’t Red Indians, but veritable 
Pre-primitives of the white race, dawn people, 
Like those who furnished Adam’s sons with wives 
However uninnocent they may have been 
In being there so early in our history. 

They’d been there then a hundred years or more. 
Pity he didn’t ask what they were up to 
At that date with a wharf already built, 

And take their name. They’ve since told me their na 
Today an honored one in Nottingham. 

As for what they were up to more than fishing— 
Suppose they weren’t behaving Puritanly, 

The hour had not yet struck for being good. 
Mankind had not yet gone on the Sabbatical. 

It became an explorer of the deep 

Not to explore too deep in others’ business. 

[ 201 ] 



Did you but know of him, Hampshire has 
One real reformer who would change the world 
So it would be accepted by two classes, 

Artists the minute they set up as artists. 

Before, that is, they are themselves accepted. 

And boys the minute they get out of college. 

I can’t help thinking those are tests to go by. 

And she has one I don’t know what to call liim. 

Who comes from Philadelphia every year 
With a great flock of chickens of rare breeds 
He wants to give the educational 
Advantages of growing almost wild 
Under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle— 
Dorkings because they’re spoken of by Chaucer, 
Sussex because they’re spoken of by Herrick. 

She has a touch of gold. New Hampshire gold— 

You may have heard of it. I had a farm 
Offered me not long since up Berlin way 
With a mine on it that was worked for gold; 

But not gold in commercial quantities, 

Just enough gold to make the engagement rings 

And marriage rings of those who owned the farm. 

What gold more innocent could one have asked for? 

One of my children ranging after rocks 

Lately brought home from Andover or Canaan 

A specimen of beryl with a trace 

Of radium. I know with radium 

The trace would have to be the merest trace 

To be below the threshold of commercial; 

But trust New Hampshire not to have enough 
Of radium or anything to sell. 

[ 202 ] 



A specimen of everything, I said. 

She has one witch— old style. She lives in Colebrook. 

(The only other witch I ever met 

Was lately at a cut-glass dinner in Boston. 

There were four candles and four people present. 

The witch was young, and beautiful (new style). 

And open-minded. She was free to question 
Her gift for reading letters locked in boxes. 

Why was it so much greater when the boxes 
Were metal than it was when they were wooden? 

It made the world seem so mysterious. 

The S’ciety for Psychical Research 

Was cognizant. Her husband was worth millions. 

I think he owned some shares in Harvard College.) 

New Hampshire used to have at Salem 
A company we called the White Corpuscles, 

Whose duty was at any hour of night 
To rush in sheets and fools’ caps where they smelled 
A thing the least bit doubtfully perscented 
And give someone the Skipper Ireson’s Ride. 

One each of everything as in a show-case. 

More than enough land for a specimen 
You’ll say she has, but there there enters in 
Something else to protect her from herself. 

There quality makes up for quantity. 

Not even New Hampshire farms are much for sale. 

The farm I made my home on in the mountains 
I had to take by force rather than buy. 

I caught the owner outdoors by himself 
Raking up after winter, and I said, 

Tm going to put you off this farm: I want it.’ 

■Where are vou going to put me? In the road?’ 

[ 203 ] 



‘I’m going to put you on the farm next to it.’ 

‘Why won’t the farm next to it do for you?’ 

‘I like this better.’ It was really better. 

Apples? New Hampshire has them, but unsprayed, 
With no suspicion in stem-end or blossom-end 
Of vitriol or arsenate of lead, 

And so not good for anything but cider. 

Her unpruned grapes are flung like lariats 
Far up the birches out of reach of man. 

A state producing precious metals, stones. 

And— writing; none of these except perhaps 
The precious literature in quantity 
Or quality to worry the producer 
About disposing of it. Do you know, 

Considering the market, there are more 
Poems produced than any other thing? 

No wonder poets sometimes have to seem 
So much more business-like than business men. 
Their wares are so much harder to get rid of. 

She’s one of the two best states in the Union. 
Vermont’s the other. And the two have been 
Yoke-fellows in the sap-yoke from of old 
In many Marches. And they lie like wedges, 

Thick end to thin end and thin end to thick end, 
And are a figure of the way the strong 
Of mind and strong of arm should fit together, 
One thick where one is thin and vice versa. 

New Hampshire raises the Connecticut 
In a trout hatchery near Canada, 

But soon divides the river with Vermont. 

[ 204 ] 



Both are delightful states for their absurdly 
Small towns— Lost Nation, Bungey, Muddy Boo, 
Poplin, Still Comers (so called not because 
The place is silent all day long, nor yet 
Because it boasts a whisky still— because 
It set out once to be a city and still 
Is only comers, cross-roads in a wood). 

And I remember one whose name appeared 
Between the pictures on a movie screen 
Election night once in Franconia, 

When everything had gone Republican 
And Democrats were sore in need of comfort: 
Easton goes Democratic, Wilson 4 
Hughes 2. And everybody to the saddest 
Laughed the loud laugh, the big laugh at the little 
New York (five million) laughs at Manchester, 
Manchester (sixty or seventy thousand) laughs 
At Littleton (four thousand), Littleton 
Laughs at Franconia (seven hundred), and 
Franconia laughs, I fear,-did laugh that night- 
At Easton. What has Easton left to laugh at, 

And like the actress exclaim, ‘Oh, my God’ at? 
There’s Bungey; and for Bungey there are towns. 
Whole townships named but without population. 

Anything I can say about New Hampshire 
Will serve almost as well about Vermont, 

Excepting that they differ in their mountains. 

The Vermont mountains stretch extended straight; 
New Hampshire mountains curl up in a coil. 

I had been coming to New Hampshire mountains. 
And here I am and what am I to say? 

[205] 



Here first my theme becomes embarrassing. 

Emerson said, ‘The God who made New Hampshire 
Taunted the lofty land with little men.’ 

Another Massachusetts poet said, 

1 go no more to summer in New Hampshire. 

I’ve given up my summer place in Dublin.’ 

But when I asked to know what ailed New Hampshire 
She said she couldn’t stand the people in it. 

The little men (it’s Massachusetts speaking). 

And when I asked to know what ailed the people, 

She said, ‘Go read your own books and find out.’ 

I may as well confess myself the author 
Of several books against the world in general. 

To take them as against a special state 
Or even nation’s to restrict my meaning. 

I’m what is called a sensibilitist. 

Or otherwise an environmentalist. 

I refuse to adapt myself a mite 

To any change from hot to cold, from wet 

To dry, from poor to rich, or back again. 

I make a virtue of my suffering 

From nearly everything that goes on round me. 

In other words, I know wherever I am. 

Being the creature of literature I am, 

I shall not lack for pain to keep me awake. 

Kit Marlowe taught me how to say my prayers: 

‘Why, this is Hell, nor am I out of it.’ 

Samoa, Russia, Ireland, I complain of. 

No less than England, France, and Italy. 

Because I wrote my novels in New Hampshire 
Is no proof that I aimed them at New Hampshire. 

When I left Massachusetts years ago 

[ 206 ] 



Between two days, the reason why I sought 
New flampshire, not Connecticut, 

Rhode Island, New York, or Vermont was this: 
Where I was living then, New Hampshire offered 
The nearest boundary to escape across. 

I hadn’t an illusion in my hand-bag 

About the people being better there 

Than those I left behind. I thought they weren’t. 

I thought they couldn’t be. And yet they were. 

I’d sure had no such friends in Massachusetts 
As Hall of Windham, Gay of Atkinson, 

Bartlett of Raymond (now of Colorado), 

Harris of Derry, and Lynch of Bethlehem. 

The glorious bards of Massachusetts seem 
To want to make New Hampshire people over. 
They taunt the lofty land with little men. 

I don’t know what to say about the people. 

For art’s sake one could almost wish them worse 
Rather than better. How are we to write 
The Russian novel in America 
As long as life goes so unterribly? 

There is the pinch from which our only outcry 
In literature to date is heard to come. 

We get what little misery we can 
Out of not having cause for misery. 

It makes the guild of novel writers sick 
To be expected to be Dostoievskis 
On nothing worse than too much luck and comfort. 
This is not sorrow, though; it’s just the vapors, 

And recognized as such in Russia itself 
Under the new regime, and so forbidden. 

If well it is with Russia, then feel free 

[ 207 ] 



To say so or be stood against the wall 
And shot. It’s Pollyanna now or death. 

This, then, is the new freedom we hear tell of; 
And very sensible. No state can build 
A literature that shall at once be sound 
And sad on a foundation of well-being. 

To show the level of intelligence 
Among us: it was just a Warren farmer 
Whose horse had pulled him short up in the road 
By me, a stranger. This is what he said, 

From nothing but embarrassment and want 
Of anything more sociable to say: 

‘You hear those hound-dogs sing on Moosilauke? 
Well they remind me of the hue and cry 
We’ve heard against the Mid-Victorians 
And never rightly understood till Bryan 
Retired from politics and joined the chorus. 

The matter with the Mid-Victorians 

Seems to have been a man named John L. Darwin. 

‘Go ’long,’ I said to him, he to his horse. 

I knew a man who failing as a farmer 

Burned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance, 

And spent the proceeds on a telescope 

To satisfy a life-long curiosity 

About our place among the infinities. 

And how was that for other-worldliness? 

If I must choose which I would elevate— 

The people or the already lofty mountains. 

I’d elevate the already lofty mountains. 

The only fault I find with old New Hampshire 
Is that her mountains aren’t quite high enough. 
[ 208 ] 



I was not always so; I’ve come to be so. 

How, to my sorrow, how have I attained 

A height from which to look down critical 

On mountains? What has given me assurance 

To say what height becomes New Hampshire mountains. 

Or any mountains? Can it be some strength 

I feel as of an earthquake in my back 

To heave them higher to the morning star? 

Can it be foreign travel in the Alps? 

Or having seen and credited a moment 
The solid molding of vast peaks of cloud 
Behind the pitiful reality 
Of Lincoln, Lafayette, and Liberty? 

Or some such sense as says how high shall jet 
The fountain in proportion to the basin? 

No, none of these has raised me to my throne 
Of intellectual dissatisfaction. 

But the sad accident of having seen 
Our actual mountains given in a map 
Of early times as twice the height they are— 

Ten thousand feet instead of only five— 

Which shows how sad an accident may be. 

Five thousand is no longer high enough. 

Whereas I never had a good idea 
About improving people in the world. 

Here I am over-fertile in suggestion, 

And cannot rest from planning day or night 
How high I’d thrust the peaks in summer snow 
To tap the upper sky and draw a flow 
Of frosty night air on the vale below 
Down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry. 


The more the sensibilitist I am 

[ 209 ] 



The more I seem to want my mountains wild; 

The way the wiry gang-boss liked the log-jam. 
After he’d picked the lock and got it started. 

He dodged a log that lifted like an arm 
Against the sky to break his back for him. 

Then came in dancing, skipping, with his life 
Across the roar and chaos, and the words 
We saw him say along the zigzag journey 
Were doubtless as the words we heard him say 
On coming nearer: Wasn’t she an i-deal 
Son-of-a-bitch? You bet she was an i-deal.’ 

For all her mountains fall a little short. 

Her people not quite short enough for Art, 

She’s still New Hampshire, a most restful state. 

Lately in converse with a New York alec 
About the new school of the pseudo-phallic, 

I found myself in a close comer where 
I had to make an almost funny choice. 

'Choose you which you will be— a prude, or puke, 
Mewling and puking in the public arms.’ 

‘Me for the hills where I don’t have to choose.’ 
‘But if you had to choose, which would you be?’ 

I wouldn’t be a prude afraid of nature. 

I know a man who took a double ax 
And went alone against a grove of trees; 

But his heart failing him, he dropped the ax 
And ran for shelter quoting Matthew Arnold: 
‘Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood; 

There’s been enough shed without shedding mine. 
Remember Bimam Woodl The wood’s in flux!’ 

He had a special terror of the flux 

[ 210 ] 



That showed itself in dendrophobia. 

The only decent tree had been to mill 
And educated into boards, he said. 

He knew too well for any earthly use 

The line where man leaves off and nature starts, 

And never over-stepped it save in dreams. 

He stood on the safe side of the line talking; 

Which is sheer Matthew Amoldism, 

The cult of one who owned himself ‘a foiled, 

Circuitous wanderer,’ and ‘took dejectedly 
His seat upon the intellectual throne.’ 

Agreed in frowning on these improvised 
Altars the woods are full of nowadays. 

Again as in the days when Ahaz sinned 
By worship under green trees in the open. 

Scarcely a mile but that I come on one, 

A black-cheeked stone and stick of rain-washed charcoal 
Even to say the groves were God’s first temples 
Comes too near to Ahaz’ sin for safety. 

Nothing not built with hands of course is sacred. 

But here is not a question of what’s sacred; 

Rather of what to face or run away from. 

I’d hate to be a runaway from nature. 

And neither would I choose to be a puke 
Who cares not what he does in company, 

And, when he can’t do anything, falls back 
On words, and tries his worst to make words speak 
Louder than actions, and sometimes achieves it. 

It seems a narrow choice the age insists on. 

How about being a good Greek, for instance? 

That course, they tell me, isn’t offered this year. 

‘Come, but this isn’t choosing— puke or prude?’ 

Well, if I have to choose one or the other, 

[ 211 ] 



I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer 
With an income in cash of say a thousand 
(From say a publisher in New York City). 

It’s restful to arrive at a decision, 

And restful just to think about New Hampshire. 
At present I am living in Vermont. 


[ 212 ] 



A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT 

For Lincoln MaeVeagh 


Never tell me that not one star of all 

That slip from heaven at night and softly fall 

Has been picked up with stones to build a wall. 

Some laborer found one faded and stone cold, 
And saving that its weight suggested gold. 

And tugged it from his first too certain hold, 

He noticed nothing in it to remark. 

He was not used to handling stars thrown dark 
And lifeless from an interrupted arc. 

He did not recognize in that smooth coal 
The one thing palpable beside the soul 
To penetrate the air in which we roll. 

He did not see how like a flying thing 
It brooded ant-eggs, and had one large wing, 
One not so large for flying in a ring, 

And a long Bird of Paradise’s tail, 

(Though these when not in use to fly and trail 
It drew back in its body like a snail); 

Nor know that he might move it from the spot, 
The harm was done; from having been star-shot 
The very nature of the soil was hot 

And burning to yield flowers instead of grain, 
Flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain 
Poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain. 
[ 213 ] 



He moved it roughly with an iron bar, 

He loaded an old stone-boat with the star 
And not, as you might think, a flying car, 

Such as even poets would admit perforce 
More practical than Pegasus the horse 
If it could put a star back in its course. 

He dragged it through the plowed ground at a pace 
But faintly reminiscent of the race 
Of jostling rock in interstellar space. 

It went for building stone, and I, as though 

Commanded in a dream, forever go 

To right the wrong that this should have been so. 

Yet ask where else it could have gone as well, 

I do not know— I cannot stop to tell: 

He might have left it lying where it fell. 

From following walls I never lift my eye 
Except at night to places in the sky 
Where showers of charted meteors let fly. 

Some may know what they seek in school and church, 
And why they seek it there; for what I search 
I must go measuring stone walls, perch on perch; 

Sure that though not a star of death and birth. 

So not to be compared, perhaps, in worth 
To such resorts of life as Mars and Earth, 


[ 214 ] 



Though not, I say, a star of death and sin 
It yet has poles, and only needs a spin 
To show its worldly nature and begin 

To chafe and shuffle in my calloused palm 
And run off in strange tangents with my arm 
As fish do with the line in first alarm. 

Such as it is, it promises the prize 
Of the one world complete in any size 
That I am like to compass, fool or wise. 


[ 215 ] 



THE CENSUS-TAKER 


I came an errand one cloud-blowing evening 
To a slab-built, black-paper-covered house 
Of one room and one window and one door. 

The only dwelling in a waste cut over 
A hundred square miles round it in the mountai n s: 
And that not dwelt in now by men or women. 

(It never had been dwelt in, though, by women, 

So what is this I make a sorrow of?) 

I came as census-taker to the waste 
To count the people in it and found none. 

None in the hundred miles, none in the house. 
Where I came last with some hope, but not much 
After hours’ overlooking from the cliffs 
An emptiness flayed to the very stone. 

I found no people that dared show themselves. 
None not in hiding from the outward eye. 

The time was autumn, but how anyone 
Could tell the time of year when every tree 
That could have dropped a leaf was down itself 
And nothing but the stump of it was left 
Now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch; 

And every tree up stood a rotting trunk 
Without a single leaf to spend on autumn, 

Or branch to whistle after what was spent. 

Perhaps the wind the more without the help 

Of breathing trees said something of the time 

Of year or day the way it swung a door 

Forever off the latch, as if rude men 

Passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him 

For the next one to open for himself. 

I counted nine I had no right to count 

[ 216 ] 



(But this was dreamy unofficial counting) 

Before I made the tenth across the threshold. 

Where was my supper? Where was anyone’s? 

No lamp was lit. Nothing was on the table. 

The stove was cold— the stove was off the chimney- 
And down by one side where it lacked a leg. 

The people that had loudly passed the door 
Were people to the ear but not the eye. 

They were not on the table with their elbows. 

They were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks. 

I saw no men there and no bones of men there. 

I armed myself against such bones as might be 
With the pitch-blackened stub of an ax-handle 
I picked up off the straw-dust covered floor. 

Not bones, but the ill-fitted window rattled. 

The door was still because I held it shut 
While I thought what to do that could be done— 
About the house— about the people not there. 

This house in one year fallen to decay 
Filled me with no less sorrow than the houses 
Fallen to ruin in ten thousand years 
Where Asia wedges Africa from Europe. 

Nothing was left to do that I could see 
Unless to find that there was no one there 
And declare to the cliffs too far for echo, 

‘The place is desert and let whoso lurks 
In silence, if in this he is aggrieved. 

Break silence now or be forever silent. 

Let him say why it should not be declared so.’ 

The melancholy of having to count souls 
Where they grow fewer and fewer every year 
Is extreme where they shrink to none at all. 

It must be I want life to go on living. 

[ 217 ] 



THE STAR-SPLITTER 


‘You know Orion always comes up sideways. 
Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains 
And rising on his hands, he looks in on me 
Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something 
I should have done by daylight, and indeed, 

After the ground is frozen, I should have done 
Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful 
Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney 
To make fun of my way of doing things. 

Or else fun of Orion’s having caught me. 

Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights 
These forces are obliged to pay respect to?’ 

So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk 
Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming. 

Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming, 

He burned his house down for the fire insurance 
And spent the proceeds on a telescope 
To satisfy a life-long curiosity 
About our place among the infinities. 

“What do you want with one of those blame things?’ 
I asked him well beforehand. ‘Don’t you get one!’ 
‘Don’t call it blamed; there isn’t anything 
More blameless in the sense of being less 
A weapon in our human fight,’ he said. 

‘I’ll have one if I sell my farm to buy it.’ 

There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground 
And plowed between the rocks he couldn’t move, 
Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years 
Trying to sell his farm and then not selling. 

He burned his house down for the fire insurance 

[ 218 ] 



And bought the telescope with what it came to. 

He had been heard to say by several: 

The best thing that we re put here for’s to see; 

The strongest thing that’s given us to see with’s 
A telescope. Someone in every town 
Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one. 

In Littleton it may as well be me.’ 

After such loose talk it was no surprise 

When he did what he did and burned his house down 

Mean laughter went about the town that day 
To let him know we weren’t the least imposed on. 
And he could wait— we’d see to him tomorrow. 

But the first thing next morning we reflected 
If one by one we counted people out 
For the least sin, it wouldn’t take us long 
To get so we had no one left to five with. 

For to be social is to be forgiving. 

Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us, 

We don’t cut off from coming to church suppers, 

But what we miss we go to him and ask for. 

He promptly gives it back, that is if still 
Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of. 

It wouldn’t do to be too hard on Brad 
About his telescope. Beyond the age 
Of being given one for Christmas gift, 

He had to take the best way he knew how 
To find himself in one. Well, all we said was 
He took a strange thing to be roguish over. 

Some sympathy was wasted on the house, 

A good old-timer dating back along; 

But a house isn’t sentient; the house 
Didn’t feel anything. And if it did, 

[ 219 ] 



Why not regard it as a sacrifice, 

And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire, 

Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction? 

Out of a house and so out of a farm 

At one stroke (of a match). Brad had to turn 

To earn a living on the Concord railroad, 

As under-ticket-agent at a station 
Where his job, when he wasn’t selling tickets, 
Was setting out up track and down, not plants 
As on a farm, but planets, evening stars 
That varied in their hue from red to green. 

He got a good glass for six hundred dollars. 

His new job gave him leisure for star-gazing. 
Often he bid me come and have a look 
Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside. 

At a star quaking in the other end. 

I recollect a night of broken clouds 
And underfoot snow melted down to ice. 

And melting further in the wind to mud. 
Bradford and I had out the telescope. 

We spread our two legs as we spread its three, 
Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it. 
And standing at our leisure till the day broke. 
Said some of the best things we ever said. 

That telescope was christened the Star-splitter, 
Because it didn’t do a thing but split 
A star in two or three the way you split 
A globule of quicksilver in your hand 
With one stroke of your finger in the middle. 
It’s a star-splitter if there ever was one 
And ought to do some good if splitting stars 
’Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood. 
[ 220 ] 



We’ve looked and looked, but after all where are we? 
Do we know any better where we are. 

And how it stands between the night tonight 
And a man with a smoky lantern chimney? 

How different from the way it ever stood? 



MAPLE 


Her teacher’s certainty it must be Mabel 
Made Maple first take notice of her name. 

She asked her father and he told her ‘Maple- 
Maple is right.’ 


‘But teacher told the school 
There’s no such name.’ 


‘Teachers don’t know as much 
As fathers about children, you tell teacher. 

You tell her that it’s M-A-P-L-E. 

You ask her if she knows a maple tree. 

Well, you were named after a maple tree. 

Your mother named you. You and she just saw 
Each other in passing in the room upstairs. 

One coming this way into life, and one 
Going the other out of life— you know? 

So you can’t have much recollection of her. 

She had been having a long look at you. 

She put her finger in your cheek so hard 
It must have made your dimple there, and said, 
“Maple.” I said it too : “Yes, for her name.” 

She nodded. So we’re sure there’s no mistake. 

I don’t know what she wanted it to mean, 

But it seems like some word she left to bid you 
Be a good girl— be like a maple tree. 

How like a maple tree’s for us to guess. 

Or for a little girl to guess sometime. 

Not now— at least I shouldn’t try too hard now. 

By and by I will tell you all I know 
About the different trees, and something, too, 

[ 222 ] 



About your mother that perhaps may help/ 
Dangerous self -arousing words to sow. 

Luckily all she wanted of her name then 
Was to rebuke her teacher with it next day, 

And give the teacher a scare as from her father. 
Anything further had been wasted on her, 

Or so he tried to think to avoid blame. 

She would forget it. She all but forgot it. 

What he sowed with her slept so long a sleep. 

And came so near death in the dark of years, 

That when it woke and came to life again 
The flower was different from the parent seed. 

It came back vaguely at the glass one day, 

As she stood saying her name over aloud, 
Striking it gently across her lowered eyes 
To make it go well with the way she looked. 
What was it about her name? Its strangeness lay 
In having too much meaning. Other names, 

As Lesley, Carol, Irma, Marjorie, 

Signified nothing. Rose could have a meaning, 
But hadn’t as it went. (She knew a Rose.) 

This difference from other names it was 
Made people notice it— and notice her. 

(They either noticed it, or got it wrong.) 

Her problem was to find out what it asked 
In dress or manner of the girl who bore it. 

If she could form some notion of her mother— 
What she had thought was lovely, and what good. 
This was her mother’s childhood home; 

The house one story high in front, three stories 
On the end it presented to the road. 

(The arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar.) 
Her mother s bedroom was her father’s yet, 

[223J 



Where she could watch her mother’s picture fading. 
Once she found for a bookmark in the Bible 
A maple leaf she thought must have been laid 
In wait for her there. She read every word 
Of the two pages it was pressed between 
As if it was her mother speaking to her. 

But forgot to put the leaf back in closing 
And lost the place never to read again. 

She was sure, though, there had been nothing in it. 

So she looked for herself, as everyone 
Looks for himself, more or less outwardly. 

And her self-seeking, fitful though it was. 

May still have been what led her on to read, 

And think a little, and get some city schooling. 

She learned shorthand, whatever shorthand may 
Have had to do with it— she sometimes wondered 
So, till she found herself in a strange place 
For the name Maple to have brought her to, 
Taking dictation on a paper pad, 

And in the pauses when she raised her eyes 
Watching out of a nineteenth story window 
An airship laboring with unship-like motion 
And a vague all-disturbing roar above the river 
Beyond the highest city built with hands. 

Someone was saying in such natural tones 
She almost wrote the words down on her knee, 

‘Do you know you remind me of a tree— 

A maple tree?* 


‘Because my name is Maple?’ 

Isn’t it Mabel? I thought it was Mabel.’ 
[ 224 ] 



‘No doubt you’ve heard the office call me Mabel. 

I have to let them call me what they like.’ 

They were both stirred that he should have divined 
Without the name her personal mystery. 

It made it seem as if there must be something 
She must have missed herself. So they were married, 
And took the fancy home with them to live by. 

They went on pilgrimage once to her father’s 
(The house one story high in front, three stories 
On the side it presented to the road) 

To see if there was not some special tree 

She might have overlooked. They could find none, 

Not so much as a single tree for shade, 

Let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard. 

She told him of the bookmark maple leaf 
In the big Bible, and all she remembered 
Of the place marked with it— “Wave offering. 
Something about wave offering, it said.’ 

'You’ve never asked your father outright, have you?’ 

‘I have, and been put off sometime, I think.’ 

(This was her faded memory of the way 
Once long ago her father had put himself off.) 

‘Because no telling but it may have been 
Something between your father and your mother 
Not meant for us at all.’ 


‘Not meant for me? 

Where would the fairness be in giving me 

[ 225 ] 



A name to carry for life, and never know 
The secret of?’ 


‘And then it may have been 
Something a father couldn’t tell a daughter 
As well as could a mother. And again 
It may have been their one lapse into fancy 
’Twould be too bad to make him sorry for 
By bringing it up to him when he was too old. 

Your father feels us round him with our questing, 
And holds us off unnecessarily. 

As if he didn’t know what little thing 
Might lead us on to a discovery. 

It was as personal as he could be 
About the way he saw it was with you 
To say your mother, had she lived, would be 
As far again as from being bom to bearing.’ 

‘Just one look more with what you say in mind, 

And I give up’; which last look came to nothing. 

But, though they now gave up the search forever, 
They clung to what one had seen in the other 
By inspiration. It proved there was something. 

They kept their thoughts away from when the maples 
Stood uniform in buckets, and the steam 
Of sap and snow rolled off the sugar house. 

When they made her related to the maples. 

It was the tree the autumn fire ran through 
And swept of leathern leaves, but left the bark 
Unscorched, unblackened, even, by any smoke. 
They always took their holidays in autumn. 

Once they came on a maple in a glade, 

Standing alone with smooth arms lifted up, 

[ 226 ] 



And every leaf of foliage she’d worn 
Laid scarlet and pale pink about her feet. 

But its age kept them from considering this one. 
Twenty-five years ago at Maple’s naming 
It hardly could have been a two-leaved seedling 
The next cow might have licked up out at pasture. 
Could it have been another maple like it? 

They hovered for a moment near discovery. 
Figurative enough to see the symbol, 

But lacking faith in anything to mean 
The same at different times to different people. 
Perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept them 
From thinking it could be a thing so bridal. 

And anyway it came too late for Maple. 

She used her hands to cover up her eyes. 

We would not see the secret if we could now: 
We are not looking for it any more.’ 

Thus had a name with meaning, given in death, 
Made a girl’s marriage, and ruled in her life. 

No matter that the meaning was not clear. 

A name with meaning could bring up a child. 
Taking the child out of the parents’ hands. 

Better a meaningless name, I should say. 

As leaving more to nature and happy chance. 
Name children some names and see what you do. 


[ 227 ] 



THE AX-HELVE 


I’ve known ere now an interfering branch 
Of alder catch my lifted ax behind me. 

But that was in the woods, to hold my hand 
From striking at another alder’s roots. 

And that was, as I say, an alder branch. 

This was a man, Baptiste, who stole one day 
Behind me on the snow in my own yard 
Where I was working at the chopping-block. 

And cutting nothing not cut down already. 

He caught my ax expertly on the rise. 

When all my strength put forth was in his favor. 
Held it a moment where it was, to calm me. 

Then took it from me— and I let him take it. 

I didn’t know him well enough to know 
What it was all about. There might be something 
He had in mind to say to a bad neighbor 
He might prefer to say to him disarmed. 

But all he had to tell me in French-English 
Was what he thought of— not me, but my ax, 

Me only as I took my ax to heart. 

It was the bad ax-helve someone had sold me— 
'Made on machine,’ he said, plowing the grain 
With a thick thumbnail to show how it ran 
Across the handle’s long drawn serpentine. 

Like the two strokes across a dollar sign. 

‘You give her one good crack, she’s snap raght off. 
Den where’s your hax-ead flying t’rough de hair?’ 
Admitted; and yet, what was that to him? 

Come on my house and I put you one in 
What’s las’ awhile— good hick’ry what’s grow crooked. 
[ 228 ] 



De second growt’ I cut myself— tough, tough!’ 

Something to sell? That wasn’t how it sounded. 

‘Den when you say you come? It’s cost you nothing. 
Tonaght?’ 

As well tonight as any night. 

Beyond an over-warmth of kitchen stove 
My welcome differed from no other welcome. 
Baptiste knew best why I was where I was. 

So long as he would leave enough unsaid, 

I shouldn’t mind his being overjoyed 

(If overjoyed he was) at having got me 

Where I must judge if what he knew about an ax 

T hat not everybody else knew was to count 

For nothing in the measure of a neighbor. 

Hard if, though cast away for life with Yankees, 

A Frenchman couldn’t get his human rating! 

Mrs. Baptiste came in and rocked a chair 
That had as many motions as the world: 

One back and forward, in and out of shadow, 

That got her nowhere; one more gradual, 

Sideways, that would have run her on the stove 
In time, had she not realized her danger 
And caught herself up bodily, chair and all. 

And set herself back where she started from. 

‘She ain’t spick too much Henglish— dats too bad. 

I was afraid, in brightening first on me. 

Then on Baptiste, as if she understood 
[229J 



What passed between us, she was only feigning. 
Baptiste was anxious for her; but no more 
Than for himself, so placed he couldn’t hope 
To keep his bargain of the morning with me 
In time to keep me from suspecting him 
Of really never having meant to keep it. 

Needlessly soon he had his ax-helves out, 

A quiverful to choose from, since he wished me 
To have the best he had, or had to spare— 

Not for me to ask which, when what he took 
Had beauties he had to point me out at length 
To insure their not being wasted on me. 

He liked to have it slender as a whipstock, 

Free from the least knot, equal to the strain 
Of bending like a sword across the knee. 

He showed me that the lines of a good helve 
Were native to the grain before the knife 
Expressed them, and its curves were no false curves 
Put on it from without. And there its strength lay 
For the hard work. He chafed its long white body 
From end to end with his rough hand shut round it. 
He tried it at the eye-hole in the ax-head. 

‘Hahn, hahn,’ he mused, ‘don’t need much taking down. 
Baptiste knew how to make a short job long 
For love of it, and yet not waste time either. 

Do you know, what we talked about was knowledge? 
Baptiste on his defense about the children 
He kept from school, or did his best to keep— 
Whatever school and children and our doubts 
Of laid-on education had to do 
With the curves of his ax-helves and his having 
[ 230 ] 



Used these unscrupulously to bring me 
To see for once the inside of his house. 

Was I desired in friendship, partly as someone 
To leave it to, whether the right to hold 
Such doubts of education should depend 
Upon the education of those who held them? 

But now he brushed the shavings from his knee 
And stood the ax there on its horse’s hoof, 

Erect, but not without its waves, as when 
The snake stood up for evil in the Garden,— 
Top-heavy with a heaviness his short, 

Thick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down 
And in a little— a French touch in that. 

Baptiste drew back and squinted at it, pleased; 

‘See how she’s cock her head!’ 


[ 231 ] 



THE GRINDSTONE 


Having a wheel and four legs of its own 
Has never availed the cumbersome grindstone 
To get it anywhere that I can see. 

These hands have helped it go, and even race; 
Not all the motion, though, they ever lent, 

Not all the miles it may have thought it went, 
Have got it one step from the starting place. 

It stands beside the same old apple tree. 

The shadow of the apple tree is thin 
Upon it now, its feet are fast in snow. 

All other farm machinery’s gone in, 

And some of it on no more legs and wheel 
Than the grindstone can boast to stand or go. 
(I’m thinking chiefly of the wheelbarrow.) 

For months it hasn’t known the taste of steel. 
Washed down with rusty water in a tin. 

But standing outdoors hungry, in the cold, 
Except in towns at night, is not a sin. 

And, anyway, its standing in the yard 
Under a ruinous live apple tree 
Has nothing any more to do with me. 

Except that I remember how of old 
One summer day, all day I drove it hard. 

And someone mounted on it rode it hard, 

And he and I between us ground a blade. 

I gave it the preliminary spin, 

And poured on water (tears it might have been). 
And when it almost gaily jumped and flowed, 

A Father-Time-like man got on and rode, 

Armed with a scythe and spectacles that glowed. 
[ 232 ] 



He turned on will-power to increase the load 
And slow me down— and I abruptly slowed, 

Like coming to a sudden railroad station. 

I changed from hand to hand in desperation. 

I wondered what machine of ages gone 
This represented an improvement on. 

For all I knew it may have sharpened spears 
And arrowheads itself. Much use for years 
Had gradually worn it an oblate 
Spheroid that kicked and struggled in its gait, 
Appearing to return me hate for hate; 

(But I forgive it now as easily 
As any other boyhood enemy 
Whose pride has failed to get him anywhere). 

I wondered who it was the man thought ground— 
The one who held the wheel back or the one 
Who gave his life to keep it going round? 

I wondered if he really thought it fair 
For him to have the say when we were done. 

Such were the bitter thoughts to which I turned. 

Not for myself was I so much concerned. 

Oh no!— although, of course, I could have found 
A better way to pass the afternoon 
Than grinding discord out of a grindstone, 

And beating insects at their gritty tune. 

Nor was I for the man so much concerned. 

Once when the grindstone almost jumped its bearing 
It looked as if he might be badly thrown 
And wounded on his blade. So far from caring, 

I laughed inside, and only cranked the faster, 

(It ran as if it wasn’t greased but glued); 

I’d welcome any moderate disaster 
[ 233 ] 



That might be calculated to postpone 
What evidently nothing could conclude. 

The thing that made me more and more afraid 
Was that we’d ground it sharp and hadn’t known. 
And now were only wasting precious blade. 

And when he raised it dripping once and tried 
The creepy edge of it with wary touch, 

And viewed it over his glasses funny-eyed. 

Only disinterestedly to decide 
It needed a turn more, I could have cried 
Wasn’t there danger of a turn too much? 

Mightn’t we make it worse instead of better? 

I was for leaving something to the whetter. 

What if it wasn’t all it should be? I’d 
Be satisfied if he’d be satisfied. 


[ 234 ] 



PAUL’S WIFE 


To drive Paul out of any lumber camp 
All that was needed was to say to him, 

‘How is the wife, Paul?’— and he’d disappear. 
Some said it was because he had no wife. 

And hated to be twitted on the subject; 

Others because he’d come within a day 
Or so of having one, and then been jilted; 

Others because he’d had one once, a good one, 
Who’d run away with someone else and left him; 
And others still because he had one now 
He only had to be reminded of,— 

He was all duty to her in a minute: 

He had to run right off to look her up. 

As if to say, ‘That’s so, how is my wife? 

I hope she isn’t getting into mischief.’ 

No one was anxious to get rid of Paul. 

He’d been the hero of the mountain camps 
Ever since, just to show them, he had slipped 
The bark of a whole tamarack off whole, 

As clean as boys do oflF a willow twig 
To make a willow whistle on a Sunday 
In April by subsiding meadow brooks. 

They seemed to ask him just to see him go. 

How is the wife, Paul?’ and he always went. 

He never stopped to murder anyone 

Who asked the question. He just disappeared— 

Nobody knew in what direction. 

Although it wasn’t usually long 
Before they heard of him in some new camp. 
The same Paul at the same old feats of logging. 
The question everywhere was why should Paul 
[ 285 ] 



Object to being asked a civil question— 

A man you could say almost anything to 
Short of a fighting word. You have the answers. 
And there was one more not so fair to Paul: 
That Paul had married a wife not his equal. 

Paul was ashamed of her. To match a hero. 

She would have had to be a heroine; 

Instead of which she was some half-breed squaw. 
But if the story Murphy told was true, 

She wasn’t anything to be ashamed of. 

You know Paul could do wonders. Everyone’s 
Heard how he thrashed the horses on a load 
That wouldn’t budge until they simply stretched 
Their rawhide harness from the load to camp. 
Paul told the boss the load would be all right, 

‘The sun will bring your load in’— and it did— 

By shrinking the rawhide to natural length. 

That’s what is called a stretcher. But I guess 
The one about his jumping so’s to land 
With both his feet at once against the ceiling. 

And then land safely right side up again. 

Back on the floor, is fact or pretty near fact. 

Well, this is such a yam. Paul sawed his wife 
Out of a white-pine log. Murphy was there, 

And, as you might say, saw the lady bom. 

Paul worked at anything in lumbering. 

He’d been hard at it taking boards away 
For— I forget— the last ambitious sawyer 
To want to find out if he couldn’t pile 
The lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy. 
They’d sliced the first slab off a big butt log, 

And the sawyer had slammed the carriage back 
[ 236 ] 



To slam end on again against the saw teeth. 

To judge them by the way they caught themselves 
When they saw what had happened to the log, 
They must have had a guilty expectation 
Something was going to go with their slambanging. 
Something had left a broad black streak of grease 
On the new wood the whole length of the log 
Except, perhaps, a foot at either end. 

But when Paul put his finger in the grease, 

It wasn’t grease at all, but a long slot. 

The log was hollow. They were sawing pine. 

‘First time I ever saw a hollow pine. 

That comes of having Paul around the place. 

Take it to hell for me,’ the sawyer said. 

Everyone had to have a look at it, 

And tell Paul what he ought to do about it. 

(They treated it as his.) “You take a jack-knife, 

And spread the opening, and you’ve got a dug-out 
All dug to go a-fishing in.’ To Paul 
The hollow looked too sound and clean and empty 
Ever to have housed birds or beasts or bees. 

There was no entrance for them to get in by. 

It looked to him like some new kind of hollow 
He thought he’d better take his jack-knife to. 

So after work that evening he came back 
And let enough light into it by cutting 
To see if it was empty. He made out in there 
A slender length of pith, or was it pith? 

It might have been the skin a snake had cast 
And left stood up on end inside the tree 
The hundred years the tree must have been growing. 
More cutting and he had this in both hands, 

And, looking from it to the pond nearby, 

[ 237 ] 



Paul wondered how it would respond to water. 

Not a breeze stirred, but just the breath of air 
He made in walking slowly to the beach 
Blew it once off his hands and almost broke it. 

He laid it at the edge where it could drink. 

At the first drink it rustled and grew limp. 

At the next drink it grew invisible. 

Paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers, 

And thought it must have melted. It was gone. 

And then beyond the open water, dim with midges, 
Where the log drive lay pressed against the boom. 

It slowly rose a person, rose a girl, 

Her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet. 

Who, leaning on a log looked back at Paul. 

And that made Paul in turn look back 
To see if it was anyone behind him 
That she was looking at instead of him. 

Murphy had been there watching all the time, 

But from a shed where neither of them could see him. 
There was a moment of suspense in birth 
When the girl seemed too water-logged to five, 

Before she caught her first breath with a gasp 
And laughed. Then she climbed slowly to her feet. 
And walked off talking to herself or Paul 
Across the logs like backs of alligators, 

Paul taking after her around the pond. 

Next evening Murphy and some other fellows 
Got drunk, and tracked the pair up Catamount, 

From the bare top of which there is a view 
To other hills across a kettle valley. 

And there, well after dark, let Murphy tell it. 

They saw Paul and his creature keeping house. 

[ 238 ] 



It was the only glimpse that anyone 

Has had of Paul and her since Murphy saw them 

Falling in love across the twilight mill-pond. 

More than a mile across the wilderness 
They sat together halfway up a cliff 
In a small niche let into it, the girl 
Brightly, as if a star played on the place, 

Paul darkly, like her shadow. All the light 
Was from the girl herself, though, not from a star. 
As was apparent from what happened next. 

All those great ruffians put their throats together, 
And let out a loud yell, and threw a bottle, 

As a brute tribute of respect to beauty. 

Of course the bottle fell short by a mile. 

But the shout reached the girl and put her light out. 
She went out like a firefly, and that was all. 

So there were witnesses that Paul was married, 

And not to anyone to be ashamed of. 

Everyone had been wrong in judging Paul. 

Murphy told me Paul put on all those airs 
About his wife to keep her to himself. 

Paul was what’s called a terrible possessor. 

Owning a wife with him meant owning her. 

She wasn’t anybody else’s business. 

Either to praise her, or so much as name her, 

And he’d thank people not to think of her. 
Murphy’s idea was that a man like Paul 
Wouldn’t be spoken to about a wife 
In any way the world knew how to speak. 


[ 239 ] 



WILD GRAPES 


What tree may not the fig be gathered from? 

The grape may not be gathered from the birch? 

It’s all you know the grape, or know the birch. 

As a girl gathered from the birch myself 
Equally with my weight in grapes, one autumn, 

I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of. 

I was bom, I suppose, like anyone. 

And grew to be a little boyish girl 
My brother could not always leave at home. 

But that beginning was wiped out in fear 
The day I swung suspended with the grapes. 

And was come after like Eurydice 

And brought down safely from the upper regions; 

And the life I live now’s an extra life 
I can waste as I please on whom I please. 

So if you see me celebrate two birthdays. 

And give myself out as two different ages. 

One of them five years younger than I look— 

One day my brother led me to a glade 
Where a white birch he knew of stood alone. 

Wearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves, 

And heavy on her heavy hair behind, 

Against her neck, an ornament of grapes. 

Grapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last yea r. 
One bunch of them, and there began to be 
Bunches all round me growing in white birdies. 

The way they grew round Leif the Lucky’s German; 
Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though. 

As the moon used to seem when I was younger, 

And only freely to be had for climbing. 

[ 240 ] 



My brother did the climbing; and at first 
Threw me down grapes to miss and scatter 
And have to hunt fcr in sweet fern and hardhack; 
Which gave him some time to himself to eat, 

But not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed. 

So then, to make me wholly self-supporting. 

He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth 
And put it in my hands to pick my own grapes. 
'Here, take a tree-top. I’ll get down another. 

Hold on with all your might when I let go.’ 

I said I had the tree. It wasn’t true. 

The opposite was true. The tree had me. 

The minute it was left with me alone 
It caught me up as if I were the fish 
And it the fishpole. So I was translated 
To loud cries from my brother of 'Let go! 

Don’t you know anything, you girl? Let go!’ 

But I, with something of the baby grip 
Acquired ancestrally in just such trees 
When wilder mothers than our wildest now 
Hung babies out on branches by the hands 
To dry or wash or tan, I don’t know which, 

(You’ll have to ask an evolutionist)— 

I held on uncomplainingly for life. 

My brother tried to make me laugh to help me. 
“What are you doing up there in those grapes? 
Don’t be afraid. A few of them won’t hurt you. 

I mean, they won’t pick you if you don’t them.’ 
Much danger of my picking anything! 

By that time I was pretty well reduced 
To a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang. 

‘Now you know how it feels,’ my brother said, 

To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them, 
[ 241 ] 



That when it thinks it has escaped the fox 
By growing where it shouldn’t— on a birch. 

Where a fox wouldn’t think to look for it— 

And if he looked and found it, couldn’t reach it— 

Just then come you and I to gather it. 

Only you have the advantage of the grapes 
In one way: you have one more stem to cling by. 

And promise more resistance to the picker.’ 

One by one I lost off my hat and shoes, 

And still I clung. I let my head fall back, 

And shut my eyes against the sun, my ears 
Against my brother’s nonsense; ‘Drop,’ he said, 

‘I’ll catch you in my arms. It isn’t far.’ 

(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.) 

‘Drop or I’ll shake the tree and shake you down.’ 

Grim silence on my part as I sank lower, 

My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo 
strings. 

Why, if she isn’t serious about it! 

Hold tight awhile till I think what to do. 

I’ll bend the tree down and let you down by it.’ 

I don’t know much about the letting down; 

But once I felt ground with my stocking feet 
And the world came revolving back to me, 

I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers. 

Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off. 
My brother said: ‘Don’t you weigh anything? 

Try to weigh something next time, so you won’t 
Be run off with by birch trees into space.’ 

It wasn’t my not weighing anything 
So much as my not knowing any thin g— 

[ 242 ] 



My brother had been nearer right before. 

I had not taken the first step in knowledge; 

I had not learned to let go with the hands, 

As still I have not learned to with the heart, 
And have no wish to with the heart— nor need, 
That I can see. The mind— is not the heart. 

I may yet live, as I know others live, 

To wish in vain to let go with the mind— 

Of cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells me 
That I need learn to let go with the heart. 


[ 243 ] 



PLACE FOR A THIRD 


Nothing to say to all those marriages! 

She had made three herself to three of his. 

The score was even for them, three to three. 

But come to die she found she cared so much: 

She thought of children in a burial row; 

Three children in a burial row were sad. 

One man’s three women in a burial row 
Somehow made her impatient with the man. 

And so she said to Laban, ‘You have done 
A good deal right; don’t do the last thing wrong. 
Don’t make me he with those two other women.’ 

Laban said. No, he would not make her lie 
With anyone but that she had a mind to. 

If that was how she felt, of course, he said. 

She went her way. But Laban having caught 
This glimpse of lingering person in Eliza, 

And anxious to make all he could of it 
With something he remembered in himself. 

Tried to think how he could exceed his promise. 

And give good measure to the dead, though thankless. 
If that was how she felt, he kept repeating. 

His first thought under pressure was a grave 
In a new boughten grave plot by herself. 

Under he didn’t care how great a stone: 

He’d sell a yoke of steers to pay for it. 

And weren’t there special cemetery flowers, 

That, once grief sets to growing, grief may rest; 

The flowers will go on with grief awhile, 

And no one seem neglecting or neglected? 

A prudent grief will not despise such aids. 

[ 244 ] 



He thought of evergreen and everlasting. 

And then he had a thought worth many of these. 
Somewhere must be the grave of the young boy 
Who married her for playmate more than helpmate, 
And sometimes laughed at what it was between them. 
How would she like to sleep her last with him? 
Where was his grave? Did Laban know his name? 

He found the grave a town or two away. 

The headstone cut with John, Beloved Husband, 
Beside it room reserved, the say a sister’s, 

A never-married sister’s of that husband, 

Whether Eliza would be welcome there. 

The dead was bound to silence: ask the sister. 

So Laban saw the sister, and, saying nothing 
Of where Eliza wanted not to lie. 

And who had thought to lay her with her first love. 
Begged simply for the grave. The sister’s face 
Fell all in wrinkles of responsibility. 

She wanted to do right. She’d have to think. 

Laban was old and poor, yet seemed to care; 

And she was old and poor— but she cared, too. 

They sat. She cast one dull, old look at him, 

Then turned him out to go on other errands 
She said he might attend to in the village. 

While she made up her mind how much she cared— 
And how much Laban cared— and why he cared, 

(She made shrewd eyes to see where he came in.) 
She’d looked Eliza up her second time, 

A widow at her second husband’s grave. 

And offered her a home to rest awhile 
Before she went the poor man’s widow’s way. 
Housekeeping for the next man out of wedlock. 

[ 245 ] 



She and Eliza had been friends through all. 

Who was she to judge marriage in a world 
Whose Bible’s so confused in marriage counsel? 

The sister had not come across this Laban; 

A decent product of life’s ironing-out; 

She must not keep him waiting. Time would press 
Between the death day and the funeral day. 

So when she saw him coming in the street 
She hurried her decision to be ready 
To meet him with his answer at the door. 

Laban had known about what it would be 
From the way she had set her poor old mouth, 

To do, as she had put it, what was right. 

She gave it through the screen door closed between them: 
‘No, not with John. There wouldn’t be no sense. 

Eliza’s had too many other men.’ 

Laban was forced to fall back on his plan 
To buy Eliza a plot to he alone in : 

Which gives him for himself a choice of lots 
When his time comes to die and settle down. 


[ 246 ] 



TWO WITCHES 


i 

THE WITCH OF COOS 

I stayed the night for shelter at a farm 
Behind the mountain, with a mother and son, 

Two old-believers. They did all the talking. 

mother. Folks think a witch who has familiar spirits 
She could call up to pass a winter evening, 

But won’t, should be burned at the stake or something. 
Summoning spirits isn’t ‘Button, button, 

Who’s got the button,’ I would have them know. 

son. Mother can make a common table rear 
And kick with two legs like an army mule. 

mother. And when I’ve done it, what good have I doner 

Rather than tip a table for you, let me 

Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me. 

He said the dead had souls, but when I asked him 
How could that be— I thought the dead were souls. 

He broke my trance. Don’t that make you suspicious 
That there’s something the dead are keeping back? 

Yes, there’s something the dead are keeping back. 

son. You wouldn’t want to tell him what we have 
Up attic, mother? 

mother. Bones— a skeleton. 

son. But the headboard of mother’s bed is pushed 
Against the attic door: the door is nailed. 

[ 247 ] 



It’s harmless. Mother hears it in the night 
Halting perplexed behind the barrier 
Of door and headboard. Where it wants to get 
Is back into the cellar where it came from. 

mother. We’ll never let them, will we, son! We’ll never! 

son. It left the cellar forty years ago 
And carried itself like a pile of dishes 
Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen. 

Another from the kitchen to the bedroom. 

Another from the bedroom to the attic, 

Right past both father and mother, and neither stopped it. 
Father had gone upstairs; mother was downstairs. 

I was a baby: I don’t know where I was. 

mother. The only fault my husband found with me— 

I went to sleep before I went to bed. 

Especially in winter when the bed 

Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow. 

The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs 
Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me, 

But left an open door to cool the room off 
So as to sort of turn me out of it. 

I was just coming to myself enough 
To wonder where the cold was coming from, 

When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom 
And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar 
The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on 
When there was water in the cellar in spring 
Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then someone 
Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step. 

The way a man with one leg and a crutch, 

[ 248 ] 



Or a little child, comes up. It wasn’t Toffile: 

It wasn’t anyone who could be there. 

The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked 
And swollen tight and buried under snow. 

The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust 
And swollen tight and buried under snow. 

It was the bones. I knew them— and good reason. 
My first impulse was to get to the knob 
And hold the door. But the bones didn’t try 
The door; they halted helpless on the landing. 
Waiting for things to happen in their favor. 

The faintest restless rustling ran all through them. 
I never could have done the thing I did 
If the wish hadn’t been too strong in me 
To see how they were mounted for this walk. 

I had a vision of them put together 
Not like a man, but like a chandelier. 

So suddenly I flung the door wide on him. 

A moment he stood balancing with emotion. 

And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire 
Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth. 
Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.) 

Then he came at me with one hand outstretched, 
The way he did in life once; but this time 
I struck the hand off brittle on the floor, 

And fell back from him on the floor myself. 

The finger-pieces slid in all directions. 

(Where did I see one of those pieces lately? 

Hand me my button-box— it must be there.) 

I sat up on the floor and shouted, “Toffile, 

It’s coming up to you.’ It had its choice 
Of the door to the cellar or the hall. 

It took the hall door for the novelty, 

[ 249 ] 



And set off briskly for so slow a thing, 

Still going every which way in the joints, though. 
So that it looked like lightning or a scribble, 

From the slap I had just now given its hand. 

I listened till it almost climbed the stairs 
From the hall to the only finished bedroom, 

Before I got up to do anything; 

Then ran and shouted, ‘Shut the bedroom door, 
Toffile, for my sake!’ ‘Company?’ he said, 

‘Don’t make me get up; I’m too warm in bed.’ 

So lying forward weakly on the handrail 
I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light 
(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own 
I could see nothing. ‘Toffile, I don’t see it. 

It’s with us in the room though. It’s the bones.’ 
‘What bones?’ ‘The cellar bones— out of the grave/ 
That made him throw his bare legs out of bed 
And sit up by me and take hold of me. 

I wanted to put out the light and see 
If I could see it, or else mow the room. 

With our arms at the level of our knees. 

And bring the chalk-pile down. ‘I’ll tell you what— 
It’s looking for another door to try. 

The uncommonly deep snow has made him think 
Of his old song, The Wild Colonial Boy, 

He always used to sing along the tote road. 

He’s after an open door to get outdoors. 

Let’s trap him with an open door up attic.’ 

Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough, 

Almost the moment he was given an opening. 

The steps began to climb the attic stairs. 

I heard them. Toffile didn’t seem to hear them. 
‘Quick!’ I slammed to the door and held the knob. 

[ 250 ] 



Toffile, get nails.’ I made him nail the door shut 
And push the headboard of the bed against it. 

Then we asked was there anything 
Up attic that we’d ever want again. 

The attic was less to us than the cellar. 

If the bones liked the attic, let them have it. 

Let them stay in the attic. When they sometimes 
Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed 
Behind the door and headboard of the bed, 

Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers, 

With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter, 

That’s what I sit up in the dark to say— 

To no one any more since Toffile died. 

Let them stay in the attic since they went there. 

I promised Toffile to be cruel to them 
For helping them be cruel once to him. 

son. We think they had a grave down in the cellar. 

mother. We know they had a grave down in the cellar. 

son. We never could find out whose bones they were. 

mother. Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for once. 
They were a man’s his father killed for me. 

I mean a man he killed instead of me. 

The least I could do was to help dig their grave. 

We were about it one night in the cellar. 

Son knows the story: but ’twas not for him 
To tell the truth, suppose the time had come. 

Son looks surprised to see me end a lie 
We’d kept all these years between ourselves 
So as to have it ready for outsiders. 

[ 251 ] 



But tonight I don’t care enough to lie— 

I don’t remember why I ever cared. 

Toffile, if he were here, I don’t believe 
Could tell you why he ever cared himself. . . . 

She hadn’t found the finger-bone she wanted 
Am ong the buttons poured out in her lap. 

I verified the name next morning: Toffile. 

The rural letter box said Toffile Lajway. 


ii 

THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON 

Now that they’ve got it settled whose I be. 

I’m going to tell them something they won’t like: 
They’ve got it settled wrong, and I can prove it. 
Flattered I must be to have two towns fighting 
To make a present of me to each other. 

They don’t dispose me, either one of them, 

To spare them any trouble. Double trouble’s 
Always the witch’s motto anyway. 

I’ll double theirs for both of them— you watch me. 
They’ll find they’ve got the whole thing to do over, 
That is, if facts is what they want to go by. 

They set a lot (now don’t they?) by a record 
Of Arthur Amy’s having once been up 
For Hog Reeve in March Meeting here in Warren. 
I could have told them any time this twelvemonth 
The Arthur Amy I was married to 
Couldn’t have been the one they say was up 
In Warren at March Meeting for the reason 
He wa n’t but fifteen at the time they say. 

[ 252 ] 



The Arthur Amy I was married to 
Voted the only times he ever voted, 

Which wasn’t many, in the town of Wentworth. 

One of the times was when ’twas in the warrant 

To see if the town wanted to take over 

The tote road to our clearing where we lived. 

I’ll tell you who’d remember— Heman Lapish. 

Their Arthur Amy was the father of mine. 

So now they’ve dragged it through the law courts once 
I guess they’d better drag it through again. 

Wentworth and Warren’s both good towns to live in. 
Only I happen to prefer to live 
In Wentworth from now on; and when all’s said, 
Right’s right, and the temptation to do right 
When I can hurt someone by doing it 
Has always been too much for me, it has. 

I know of some folks that’d be set up 
At having in their town a noted witch: 

But most would have to think of the expense 
That even I would be. They ought to know 
That as a witch I’d often milk a bat 
And that’d be enough to last for days. 

It’d make my position stronger, think, 

If I was to consent to give some sign 
To make it surer that I was a witch? 

It wa’n’t no sign, I s’pose, when Mallice Huse 
Said that I took him out in his old age 
And rode all over everything on him 
Until I’d had him worn to skin and bones. 

And if I’d left him hitched unblanketed 
In front of one Town Hall, I’d left him hitched 
In front of every one in Grafton County. 

Some cried shame on me not to blanket him, 

[ 253 ] 



The poor old man. It would have been all right 
If someone hadn’t said to gnaw the posts 
He stood beside and leave his trade mark on them, 
So they could recognize them. Not a post 
That they could hear tell of was scarified. 

They made him keep on gnawing till he whined. 
Then that same smarty someone said to look— 
He’d bet Huse was a cribber and had gnawed 
The crib he slept in— and as sure’s you’re bom 
They found he’d gnawed the four posts of his bed, 
All four of them to splinters. What did that prove? 
Not that he hadn’t gnawed the hitching posts 
He said he had besides. Because a horse 
Gnaws in the stable ain’t no proof to me 
He don’t gnaw trees and posts and fences too. 

But everybody took it for a proof. 

I was a strapping girl of twenty then. 

The smarty someone who spoiled everything 
Was Arthur Amy. You know who he was. 

That was the way he started courting me. 

He never said much after we were married, 

But I mistrusted he was none too proud 
Of having interfered in the Huse business. 

I guess he found he got more out of me 
By having me a witch. Or something happened 
To turn him round. He got to saying things 
To undo what he’d done and make it right, 

Like, 'No, she ain’t come back from kiting yet. 

Last night was one of her nights out. She’s kiting. 
She thinks when the wind makes a night of it 
She might as well herself.’ But he liked best 
To let on he was plagued to death with me: 

If anyone had seen me coming home 

[ 254 ] 



Over the ridgepole, ’stride of a broomstick. 

As often as he had in the tail of the night. 

He guessed they’d know what he had to put up with. 

Well, I showed Arthur Amy signs enough 

Off from the house as far as we could keep 

And from barn smells you can’t wash out of plowed ground 

With all the rain and snow of seven years; 

And I don’t mean just skulls of Rogers’ Rangers 
On Moosilauke, but woman signs to man, 

Only bewitched so I would last him longer. 

Up where the trees grow short, the mosses tall, 

I made him gather me wet snow berries 
On slippery rocks beside a waterfall. 

I made him do it for me in the dark. 

And he liked everything I made him do. 

I hope if he is where he sees me now 
He’s so far off he can’t see what I’ve come to. 

You can come down from everything to nothing. 

All is, if I’d a-known when I was young 
And full of it, that this would be the end. 

It doesn’t seem as if I’d had the courage 
To make so free and kick up in folks’ faces. 

I might have, but it doesn’t seem as if. 


[ 255 ] 



AN EMPTY THREAT 


I stay; 

But it isn’t as if 

There wasn’t always Hudson’s Bay 
And the fur trade, 

A small skiff 
And a paddle blade. 

I can just see my tent pegged. 

And me on the floor, 

Crosslegged, 

And a trapper looking in at the door 
With furs to sell. 

His name’s Joe, 

Alias John, 

And between what he doesn’t know 
And won’t tell 

About where Henry Hudson’s gone, 
I can’t say he’s much help; 

But we get on. 

The seal yelp 
On an ice cake. 

It’s not men by some mistake? 

No, 

There’s not a soul 
For a wind-break 
Between me and the North Pole— 

Except always John-Joe, 

My French Indian Esquimaux, 

[ 256 ] 



And he’s off setting traps, 

In one himself perhaps. 

Give a head shake 
Over so much bay 
Thrown away 
In snow and mist 
That doesn’t exist, 

I was going to say, 

For God, man or beast’s sake, 

Yet does perhaps for all three. 

Don’t ask Joe 
What it is to him. 

It’s sometimes dim 
What it is to me. 

Unless it be 

It’s die old captain’s dark fate 
Who failed to find or force a strait 
In its two-thousand-mile coast; 

And his crew left him where he failed, 
And nothing came of all he sailed. 

It’s to say, ‘You and I’ 

To such a ghost, 

“You and I 
Off here 

With the dead race of the Great Auk! ! 
And, ‘Better defeat almost, 

If seen clear. 

Than life’s victories of doubt 
That need endless talk talk 
To make them out.’ 

[ 257 ] 



A FOUNTAIN, A BOTTLE, A DONKEY’S EARS 
AND SOME BOOKS 


Old Davis owned a solid mica mountain 
In Dalton that would some day make his fortune. 
There’d been some Boston people out to see it: 

And experts said that deep down in the mountain 
The mica sheets were big as plate glass windows. 

He’d like to take me there and show it to me. 

Til tell you what you show me. You remember 
You said you knew the place where once, on Kinsman, 
The early Mormons made a settlement 
And built a stone baptismal font outdoors— 

But Smith, or someone, called them off the mountain 
To go West to a worse fight with the desert. 

You said you’d seen the stone baptismal font. 

Well, take me there.’ 


‘Some day I will.’ 


‘Today.’ 

Huh, that old bathtub, what is that to see? 

Let’s talk about it.’ 


‘Let’s go see the place.’ 

‘To shut you up I’ll tell you what I’ll do: 

I’ll find that fountain if it takes all summer. 
And both of our united strengths, to do it.’ 

‘You’ve lost it, then?’ 


[ 258 ] 



‘Not so but I can find it. 

No doubt it’s grown up some to woods around it. 
The mountain may have shifted since I saw it 
In eighty-five.’ 


‘As long ago as that?’ 

‘If I remember rightly, it had sprung 
A leak and emptied then. And forty years 
Can do a good deal to bad masonry. 

You won’t see any Mormon swimming in it. 
But you have said it, and we’re off to find it. 
Old as I am. I’m going to let myself 
Be dragged by you all over everywhere—’ 

‘I thought you were a guide.’ 


‘I am a guide, 

And that’s why I can’t decently refuse you.’ 

We made a day of it out of the world. 
Ascending to descend to reascend. 

The old man seriously took his bearings. 

And spoke his doubts in every open place. 

We came out on a look-off where we faced 
A cliff, and on the cliff a bottle painted, 

Or stained by vegetation from above, 

A likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist. 

‘Well, if I haven’t brought you to the fountain, 
At least I’ve brought you to the famous Bottle.’ 

T won’t accept the substitute. It’s empty.’ 

[ 259 ] 



‘So’s everything.’ 


1 want my fountain.’ 

1 guess you’d find the fountain just as empty. 

And anyway this tells me where I am.’ 

‘Hadn’t you long suspected where you were?’ 

“You mean miles from that Mormon settlement? 
Look here, you treat your guide with due respect 
If you don’t want to spend the night outdoors. 

I vow we must be near the place from where 
The two converging slides, the avalanches. 

On Marshall, look like donkey’s ears. 

We may as well see that and save the day.’ 

‘Don’t donkey’s ears suggest we shake our own?’ 

‘For God’s sake, aren’t you fond of viewing nature? 
You don’t like nature. All you like is books. 

What signify a donkey’s ears and bottle. 

However natural? Give you your books! 

Well then, right here is where I show you books. 
Come straight down off this mountain j'ust as fast 
As we can fall and keep a-bouncing on our feet. 

It’s hell for knees unless done hell-for-leather.’ 

*Be ready,’ I thought, ‘for almost anything.’ 

We struck a road I didn’t recognize, 

But welcomed for the chance to lave my shoes 
In dust once more. We followed this a mife 

[ 260 ] 



Perhaps, to where it ended at a house 
I didn’t know was there. It was the kind 
To bring me to for broad-board paneling. 

I never saw so good a house deserted. 

‘Excuse me if I ask you in a window 
That happens to be broken,’ Davis said. 

‘The outside doors as yet have held against us. 

I want to introduce you to the people 
Who used to live here. They were Robinsons. 

You must have heard of Clara Robinson, 

The poetess who wrote the book of verses 
And had it published. It was all about 
The posies on her inner window sill. 

And the birds on her outer window sill, 

And how she tended both, or had them tended: 
She never tended anything herself. 

She was “shut in” for life. She lived her whole 
Life long in bed, and wrote her things in bed. 

I’ll show you how she had her sills extended 
To entertain the birds and hold the flowers. 

Our business first’s up attic with her books.’ 

We trod uncomfortably on crunching glass 
Through a house stripped of everything 
Except, it seemed, the poetess’s poems. 

Books, I should say!— if books are what is needed. 
A whole edition in a packing-case, 

That, overflowing like a horn of plenty, 

Or like the poetess’s heart of love, 

Had spilled them near the window toward the light 
Where driven rain had wet and swollen them. 
Enough to stock a village library— 

[ 261 ] 



Unfortunately all of one kind, though. 

They had been brought home from some publisher 
And taken thus into the family. 

Boys and bad hunters had known what to do 
With stone and lead to unprotected glass: 

Shatter it inward on the unswept floors. 

How had the tender verse escaped their outrage? 
By being invisible for what it was, 

Or else by some remoteness that defied them 
To find out what to do to hurt a poem. 

Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book, 

To send it sailing out the attic window 
Till it caught wind, and, opening out its covers. 
Tried to improve on sailing like a tile 
By flying like a bird (silent in flight, 

But all the burden of its body song), 

Only to tumble like a stricken bird, 

And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved. 

Books were not thrown irreverently about. 

They simply lay where someone now and then. 
Having tried one, had dropped it at his feet 
And left it lying where it fell rejected. 

Here were all those the poetess’s life 
Had been too short to sell or give away. 

‘Take one,’ Old Davis bade me graciously. 

*Why not take two or three?’ 


‘Take all you want. 

Good-looking books like that.’ He picked one fresh 
In virgin wrapper from deep in the box, 

And stroked it with a horny-handed kindness. 

[ 262 ] 



He read in one and I read m another, 

Both either looking for or finding something. 

The attic wasps went missing by like bullets. 

I was soon satisfied for the time being. 

All the way home I kept remembering 
The small book in my pocket. It was there. 

The poetess had sighed, I knew, in heaven 
At having eased her heart of one more copy— 
Legitimately. My demand upon her, 

Though slight, was a demand. She felt the tug. 
In time she would be rid of all her books. 


[ 263 ] 



I WILL SING YOU ONE-O 


It was long I lay 
Awake that night 
Wishing the tower 
Would name the hour 
And tell me whether 
To call it day 
(Though not yet light) 

And give up sleep. 

The snow fell deep 
With the hiss of spray; 

Two winds would meet. 
One down one street. 

One down another, 

And fight in a smother 
Of dust and feather. 

I could not say, 

But feared the cold 
Had checked the pace 
Of the tower clock 
By tying together 
Its hands of gold 
Before its face. 

Then came one knock! 

A note unruffled 
Of earthlv weather. 

Though strange and muffled 
The tower said, ‘One!’ 

And then a steeple. 

They spoke to themselves 
And such few people 
[ 264 ] 



As winds might rouse 
From sleeping warm 
(But not unhouse). 

They left the storm 
That struck en masse 
My window glass 
Like a beaded fur. 

In that grave One 
They spoke of the sun 
And moon and stars, 
Saturn and Mars 
And Jupiter. 

Still more unfettered, 
They left the named 
And spoke of the lettered, 
The sigmas and taus 
Of constellations. 

They filled their throats 
With the furthest bodies 
To which man sends his 
Speculation, 

Beyond which God is; 

The cosmic motes 
Of yawning lenses. 

Their solemn peals 
Were not their own: 

They spoke for the clock 
With whose vast wheels 
Theirs interlock. 

In that grave word 
Uttered alone 
The utmost star 
Trembled and stirred, 
[ 265 ] 



Though set so far 
Its whirling frenzies 
Appear like standing 
In one self station. 

It has not ranged, 

And save for the wonder 
Of once expanding 
To be a nova, 

It has not changed 
To the eye of man 
On planets over 
Around and under 
It in creation 
Since man began 
To drag down man 
And nation nation. 


[ 266 ] 



FRAGMENTARY BLUE 


Why make so much of fragmentary blue 
In here and there a bird, or butterfly, 

Or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye, 

When heaven presents in sheets the solid hue? 

Since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet)— 
Though some savants make earth include the sky; 
And blue so far above us comes so high, 

It only gives our wish for blue a whet. 


[ 267 ] 



FIRE AND ICE 


Some say the world will end in 
Some say in ice. 

From what I’ve tasted of desire 
I hold with those who favor fire. 
But if it had to perish twice, 

I think I know enough of hate 
To say that for destruction ice 
Is also great 
And would suffice. 


[ 268 ] 



IN A DISUSED GRAVEYARD 


The living come with grassy tread 
To read the gravestones on the hill; 
The graveyard draws the living still, 
But never any more the dead. 

The verses in it say and say: 

"The ones who living come today 
To read the stones and go away 
Tomorrow dead will come to stay.’ 

So sure of death the marbles rhyme, 
Yet can’t help marking all the time 
How no one dead will seem to come. 
What is it men are shrinking from? 

It would be easy to be clever 
And tell the stones : Men hate to die 
And have stopped dying now forever. 
I think they would believe the He. 


[ 269 ] 



DUST OF SNOW 


The way a crow 
Shook down on me 
The dust of snow 
From a hemlock tree 

Has given my heart 
A change of mood 
And saved some part 
Of a day I had rued. 


[ 270 ] 



TO E. T. 


I slumbered with your poems on my breast 
Spread open as I dropped them half-read through 
Like dove wings on a figure on a tomb 
To see, if in a dream they brought of you, 

I might not have the chance I missed in life 
Through some delay, and call you to your face 
First soldier, and then poet, and then both. 

Who died a soldier-poet of your race. 

I meant, you meant, that nothing should remain 
Unsaid between us, brother, and this remained— 

And one thing more that was not then to say: 

The Victory for what it lost and gained. 

You went to meet the shell’s embrace of fire 
On Vimy Ridge; and when you fell that day 
The war seemed over more for you than me, 

But now for me than you— the other way. 

How over, though, for even me who knew 
The foe thrust back unsafe beyond the Rhine, 

If I was not to speak of it to you 

And see you pleased once more with words of mine? 


[ 271 ] 



NOTHING GOLD CAN STAY 


Nature’s first green is gold, 
Her hardest hue to hold. 
Her early leafs a flower; 
But only so an hour. 

Then leaf subsides to leaf. 
So Eden sank to grief, 

So dawn goes down to day. 
Nothing gold can stay. 


[ 272 ] 



THE RUNAWAY 


Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall, 
We stopped by a mountain pasture to say, Whose colt?’ 
A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall, 

The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head 
And snorted at us. And then he had to bolt. 

We heard the miniature thunder where he fled, 

And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and gray, 
Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes. 

‘I think the little fellow’s afraid of the snow. 

He isn’t winter-broken. It isn’t play 

With the little fellow at all. He’s running away. 

I doubt if even his mother could tell him, “Sakes, 

It’s only weather.” He’d think she didn’t know! 

Where is his mother? He can’t be out alone.’ 

And now he comes again with clatter of stone. 

And mounts the wall again with whited eyes 
And all his tail that isn’t hair up straight. 

He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies. 

Whoever it is that leaves him out so late. 

When other creatures have gone to stall and bin, 
Ought to be told to come and take him in.’ 


[ 273 ] 



THE AIM WAS SONG 


Before man came to blow it right 
The wind once blew itself untaught, 
And did its loudest day and night 
In any rough place where it caught. 

Man came to tell it what was wrong: 

It hadn’t found the place to blow; 

It blew too hard— the aim was song. 

And listen— how it ought to go! 

He took a little in his mouth. 

And held it long enough for north 
To be converted into south, 

And then by measure blew it forth. 

By measure. It was word and note, 

The wind the wind had meant to be— 
A little through the lips and throat. 

The aim was song— the wind could see. 


[ 274 ] 



STOPPING BY WOODS ON A 
SNOWY EVENING 


Whose woods these are I think I know. 
His house is in the village though; 

He will not see me stopping here 
To watch his woods fill up with snow. 

My little horse must think it queer 
To stop without a farmhouse near 
Between the woods and frozen lake 
The darkest evening of the year. 

He gives his harness bells a shake 
To ask if there is some mistake. 

The only other sound’s the sweep 
Of easy wind and downy flake. 

The woods are lovely, dark and deep. 
But I have promises to keep, 

And miles to go before I sleep, 

And miles to go before I sleep. 


FOR ONCE, THEN, SOMETHING 


Others taunt me with having knelt at well-curbs 
Always wrong to the light, so never seeing 
Deeper down in the well than where the water 
Gives me back in a shining surface picture 
Me myself in the summer heaven godlike 
Looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs. 

Once, when trying with chin against a well-curb, 

I discerned, as I thought, beyond the picture, 

Through the picture, a something white, uncertain, 
Something more of the depths— and then I lost it. 
Water came to rebuke the too clear water. 

One drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple 
Shook whatever it was lay there at bottom. 

Blurred it, blotted it out. What was that whiteness? 
Truth? A pebble of quartz? For once, then, something. 


[ 276 ] 



BLUE-BUTTERFLY DAY 


It is blue-butterfly day here in spring, 

And with these sky-flakes down in flurry on flurry 
There is more unmixed color on the wing 
Than flowers will show for days unless they hurry. 

But these are flowers that fly and all but sing: 

And now from having ridden out desire 
They lie closed over in the wind and cling 
Where wheels have freshly sliced the April mire. 


[ 277 ] 



THE ONSET 


Always the same, when on a fated night 
At last the gathered snow lets down as white 
As may be in dark woods, and with a song 
It shall not make again all winter long 
Of hissing on the yet uncovered ground, 

I almost stumble looking up and round, 

As one who overtaken by the end 
Gives up his errand, and lets death descend 
Upon him where he is, with nothing done 
To evil, no important triumph won. 

More than if life had never been begun. 

Yet all the precedent is on my side: 

I know that winter death has never tried 
The earth but it has failed: the snow may heap 
In long storms an undrifted four feet deep 
As measured against maple, birch, and oak. 

It cannot check the peeper’s silver croak; 

And I shall see the snow all go down hill 

In water of a slender April rill 

That flashes tail through last year’s withered brake 

And dead weeds, like a disappearing snake. 

Nothing will be left white but here a birch, 

And there a clump of houses with a church. 


[ 278 ] 



TO EARTHWARD 


Love at the lips was touch 
As sweet as I could bear; 

And once that seemed too much; 

I lived on air 

That crossed me from sweet things 
The flow of— was it musk 
From hidden grapevine springs 
Down hill at dusk? 

I had the swirl and ache 
From sprays of honeysuckle 
That when they’re gathered shake 
Dew on the knuckle. 

I craved strong sweets, but those 
Seemed strong when I was young; 
The petal of the rose 
It was that stung. 

Now no joy but lacks salt 
That is not dashed with pain 
And weariness and fault; 

I crave the stain 

Of tears, the aftermark 
Of almost too much love, 

The sweet of bitter bark 
And burning clove. 

When stiff and sore and scarred 
I take away my hand 
[ 279 ] 



From leaning on it hard 
In grass and sand, 

The hurt is not enough: 

I long for weight and strength 
To feel the earth as rough 
To all my length. 


[ 280 ] 



GOOD-BY AND KEEP COLD 


This saying good-by on the edge of the dark 
And the cold to an orchard so young in the bark 
Reminds me of all that can happen to harm 
An orchard away at the end of the farm 
All winter, cut off by a hill from the house. 

I don’t want it girdled by rabbit and mouse, 

I don’t want it dreamily nibbled for browse 
By deer, and I don’t want it budded by grouse. 

(If certain it wouldn’t be idle to call 

I’d summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall 

And warn them away with a stick for a gun.) 

I don’t want it stirred by the heat of the sun. 

(We made it secure against being, I hope, 

By setting it out on a northerly slope.) 

No orchard’s the worse for the wintriest storm; 

But one thing about it, it mustn’t get warm. 

‘How often already you’ve had to be told, 

Keep cold, young orchard. Good-by and keep cold. 
Dread fifty above more than fifty below.’ 

I have to be gone for a season or so. 

My business awhile is with different trees. 

Less carefully nurtured, less fruitful than these. 
And such as is done to their wood with an ax— 
Maples and birches and tamaracks. 

I wish I could promise to lie in the night 
And think of an orchard’s arboreal plight 
When slowly (and nobody comes with a light) 

Its heart sinks lower under the sod. 

But something has to be left to God. 


[ 281 ] 



TWO LOOK AT TWO 


Love and forgetting might have carried them 

A little further up the mountamside 

With night so near, but not much further up. 

They must have halted soon in any case 

With thoughts of the path back, how rough it was 

With rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness; 

"When they were halted by a tumbled wall 
With barbed-wire binding. They stood facing this. 
Spending what onward impulse they still had 
In one last look the way they must not go, 

On up the failing path, where, if a stone 
Or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself; 

No footstep moved it. ‘This is all,’ they sighed, 
‘Good-night to woods/ But not so, there was more. 

A doe from round a spruce stood looking at them 
Across the wall, as near the wall as they. 

She saw them in their field, they her in hers. 

The difficulty of seeing what stood still. 

Like some up-ended boulder split in two. 

Was in her clouded eyes: they saw no fear there. 

She seemed to think that two thus they were safe. 
Then, as if they were something that, though strange, 
She could not trouble her mind with too long, 

She sighed and passed unscared along the wall. 

‘This, then, is all. What more is there to ask?’ 

But no, not yet. A snort to bid them wait. 

A buck from round the spruce stood looking at them 
Across the wall as near the wall as they. 

This was an antlered buck of lusty nostril, 

Not the same doe come back into her place. 

He viewed them quizzically with jerks of head, 

[ 282 ] 



As if to ask, “Why don’t you make some motion? 

Or give some sign of life? Because you can’t 
I doubt if you’re as living as you look.’ 

Thus till he had them almost feeling dared 
To stretch a proffering hand— and a spell-breaking. 
Then he too passed unscared along the wall. 

Two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from. 
T his must be all ’ It was all. Still they stood, 

A great wave from it going over them. 

As if the earth in one unlooked-for favor 

Had made them certain earth returned their love.

NOT TO KEEP 


They sent him back to her. The letter came 
Saying . . And she could have him. And before 

She could be sure there was no hidden ill 
Under the formal writing, he was there. 

Living. They gave him back to her alive— 

How else? They are not known to send the dead— 
And not disfigured visibly. His face? 

His hands? She had to look, to look and ask, 
‘What is it, dear?’ And she had given all 
And still she had all —they had— they the lucky! 
Wasn’t she glad now? Everything seemed won, 
And all the rest for them permissible ease. 

She had to ask, ‘What was it, dear?’ 


‘Enough, 

Yet not enough. A bullet through and through, 
High in the breast. Nothing but what good care 
And medicine and rest, and you a week, 

Can cure me of to go again ’ The same 
Grim giving to do over for them both. 

She dared no more than ask him with her eyes 
How was it with him for a second trial. 

And with his eyes he asked her not to ask. 

They had given him back to her, but not to keep.

A BROOK IN THE CITY 


The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square 
With the new city street it has to wear 
A number in. But what about the brook 
That held the house as in an elbow-crook? 

I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength 
And impulse, having dipped a finger length 
And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed 
A flower to try its currents where they crossed. 

The meadow grass could be cemented down 
From growing under pavements of a town, 

The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame. 

Is water wood to serve a brook the same? 

How else dispose of an immortal force 

No longer needed? Staunch it at its source 

With cmder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown 

Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone 

In fetid darkness still to live and run— 

And all for nothing it had ever done 
Except forget to go in fear perhaps. 

No one would know except for ancient maps 
That such a brook ran water. But I wonder 
If from its being kept forever under 
The thoughts may not have risen that so keep 
This new-built city from both work and sleep. 


[ 285 ] 



THE KITCHEN CHIMNEY 


Builder, in building the little house, 

In every way you may please yourself; 

But please please me in the kitchen chimney: 
Don’t build me a chimney upon a shelf. 

However far you must go for bricks. 

Whatever they cost a-piece or a pound, 

Buy me enough for a full-length chimney, 

And build the chimney clear from the ground. 

It’s not that I’m greatly afraid of fire. 

But I never heard of a house that throve 
(And I know of one that didn’t thrive) 

Where the chimney started above the stove. 

And I dread the ominous stain of tar 
That there always is on the papered walls, 

And the smell of fire drowned in rain 

That there always is when the chimney’s false. 

A shelf s for a clock or vase or picture, 

But I don’t see why it should have to bear 
A chimney that only would serve to remind me 
Of castles I used to build in air. 


[ 286 ] 



LOOKING FOR A SUNSET BIRD 
IN WINTER 

The west was getting out of gold, 

The breath of air had died of cold. 
When shoeing home across the white, 
I thought I saw a bird alight 

In summer when I passed the place 
I had to stop and lift my face; 

A bird with an angelic gift 
Was singing in it sweet and swift. 

No bird was singing in it now. 

A single leaf was on a bough, 

And that was all there was to see 
In going twice around the tree. 

From my advantage on a hill 
I judged that such a crystal chill 
Was only addmg frost to snow 
As gilt to gold that wouldn’t show. 

A brush had left a crooked stroke 
Of what was either cloud or smoke 
From north to south across the blue; 

A piercing little star was through. 


[ 287 ] 



A BOUNDLESS MOMENT 


He halted in the wind, and— what was that 
Far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost? 

He stood there hanging March against his thought. 
And yet too ready to believe the most. 

‘Oh, that’s the Paradise-in-bloom,’ I said; 

And truly it was fair enough for flowers 
Had we but in us to assume in March 
Such white luxuriance of May for ours. 

We stood a moment so in a strange world, 

Myself as one his own pretense deceives. 

And then I said the truth (and we moved on). 

A young beech clinging to its last year’s leaves. 


[ 288 ] 



EVENING IN A SUGAR ORCHARD 


From where I lingeied in a lull in March 
Outside the sugar-house one night for choice, 

I called the fireman with a careful voice 
And bade him leave the pan and stoke the arch: 

‘O fireman, give the fire another stoke, 

And send more sparks up chimney with the smoke.’ 

I thought a few might tangle, as they did. 

Among bare maple boughs, and in the rare 
Hill atmosphere not cease to glow, 

And so be added to the moon up there. 

The moon, though slight, was moon enough to show 
On every tree a bucket with a lid, 

And on black ground a bear-skin rug of snow. 

The sparks made no attempt to be the moon 
They were content to figure in the trees 
As Leo, Orion, and the Pleiades. 

And that was what the boughs were full of soon. 


[ 289 ] 



GATHERING LEAVES 


Spades take up leaves 
No better than spoons. 
And bags full of leaves 
Are light as balloons. 

I make a great noise 
Of rustling all day 
Like rabbit and deer 
Running away. 

But the mountains I raise 
Elude my embrace. 
Flowing over my arms 
And into my face. 

I may load and unload 
Again and again 
Till I fill the whole shed. 
And what have I then? 

Next to nothing for weight. 
And since they grew duller 
From contact with earth, 
Next to nothing for color. 

Next to nothing for use. 

But a crop is a crop. 

And who’s to say where 
The harvest shall stop? 


[ 290 ] 



THE VALLEY’S SINGING DAY 


The sound of the closing outside door was all. 

You made no sound in the grass with your footfall, 
As far as you went from the door, which was not far, 
But you had awakened under the morning star 
The first song-bird that awakened all the lest. 

He could have slept but a moment more at best. 
Already determined dawn began to lay 
In place across a cloud the slender ray 
For prying beneath and forcing the lids of sight. 
And loosing the pent-up music of over-night. 

But dawn was not to begm their pearly-pearly’ 

(By which they mean the ram is pearls so early, 
Before it changes to diamonds in the sun), 

Neither was song that day to be self-begun. 

You had begun it, and if there needed proof— 

I was asleep still under the dripping roof, 

My window curtain hung over the sill to wet; 

But I should awake to confirm your story yet, 

I should be willing to say and help you say 
That once you had opened the valley’s singing day. 


[ 291 ] 



MISGIVING 


All crying, "We will go with you, O Wrndl’ 

The foliage follow him, leaf and stem, 

But a sleep oppresses them as they go, 

And they end by bidding him stay with them. 

Since ever they flung abroad in spring 

The leaves had promised themselves this flight, 

Who now would fain seek sheltering wall, 

Or thicket, or hollow place for the night. 

And now they answer his summoning blast 
With an ever vaguer and vaguer stir. 

Or at utmost a little reluctant whirl 

That drops them no further than where they were. 

I only hope that when I am free 
As they are free to go in quest 
Of the knowledge beyond the bounds of life 
It may not seem better to me to rest. 


[ 292 ] 



A HILLSIDE THAW 


To think to know the country and not know 
The hillside on the day the sun lets go 
Ten million silver hzards out of snowl 
As often as I’ve seen it done before 
I can’t pretend to tell the way it’s done. 

It looks as if some magic of the sun 
Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor 
And the light breaking on them made them run. 
But if I thought to stop the wet stampede. 

And caught one silver lizard by the tail, 

And put my foot on one without avail, 

And threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed 
In front of twenty others’ wriggling speed,— 

In the confusion of them all aglitter, 

And birds that joined in the excited fun 
By doubling and redoubling song and twitter, 

I have no doubt I’d end by holding none. 

It takes the moon for this. The sun’s a wizard 
By all I tell, but so s the moon a witch. 

From the high west she makes a gentle cast 
And suddenly, without a jerk or twitch, 

She has her spell on every single lizard. 

I fancied when I looked at six o’clock 
The swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast. 

The moon was waiting for her chill effect 
I looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock 
In every lifelike posture of the swarm, 
Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect. 
Across each other and side by side they lay. 

The spell that so could hold them as they were 

[ 293 ] 



Was wrought through trees without a breath of storm 
To make a leaf, if there had been one, stir. 

It was the moon’s: she held them until day, 

One lizard at the end of every ray 

The drought of my attempting such a stayl 


[ 294 ] 



PLOWMEN 


A plow, they sav, to plow the snow. 
They cannot mean to plant it, no— 
Unless m bitterness to mock 
At having cultivated rock. 



ON A TREE FALLEN ACROSS THE ROAD 
(to hear us talk) 


The tree the tempest with a crash of wood 
Throws down in front of us is not to bar 
Our passage to our journey’s end for good. 

But just to ask us who we think we are 

Insisting always on our own way so. 

She likes to halt us in our runner tracks, 

And make us get down in a foot of snow 
Debating what to do without an ax 

And yet she knows obstruction is in vain' 

We will not be put off the final goal 
We have it hidden in us to attain, 

Not though we have to seize earth by the pole 

And, tired of aimless circling in one place, 

Steer straight off after something into space. 


[ 296 ] 



OUR SINGING STRENGTH 


It snowed in spring on earth so diy and warm 
The flakes could find no landing place to form. 

Hordes spent themselves to make it wet and cold. 

And still they failed of any lasting hold. 

They made no white impression on the black. 

They disappeared as if earth sent them back. 

Not till from separate flakes they changed at night 
To almost strips and tapes of ragged white 
Did grass and garden ground confess it snowed, 

And all go back to winter but the road 

Next day the scene was piled and puffed and dead. 

The grass lay flattened under one great tread. 

Borne down until the end almost took root. 

The rangey bough anticipated fruit 

With snowballs cupped in every opening bud. 

The road alone maintained itself in mud. 

Whatever its secret was of greater heat 
From inward fires or brush of passing feet. 

In spring more mortal singers than belong 
To any one place cover us with song. 

Thrush, bluebird, blackbird, sparrow, and robin throng. 
Some to go further north to Hudson’s Bay, 

Some that have come too far north back away, 

Really a very few to build and stay. 

Now was seen how these liked belated snow. 

The fields had nowhere left for them to go; 

They’d soon exhausted all there was in flying; 

The trees they’d had enough of with once trying 
And setting off their heavy powder load. 

They could find nothing open but the road. 

[ 297 ] 



So there they let their hves be narrowed in 
By thousands the bad weather made akin. 

The road became a channel running flocks 
Of glossy birds like ripples over rocks. 

I drove them under foot in bits of flight 
That kept the ground, almost disputing right 
Of way with me from apathy of wing, 

A talking twitter all they had to sing. 

A few I must have dnven to despair 

Made quick asides, but having done in air 

A whir among white branches great and small 

As in some too much carven marble hall 

Where one false wing beat would have brought down all, 

Came tamely back in front of me, the Drover, 

To suffer the same driven nightmare over. 

One such storm in a lifetime couldn’t teach them 
That back behind pursuit it couldn’t reach them. 

None flew behind me to be left alone. 

Well, something for a snowstorm to have shown 
The country’s singing strength thus brought together. 

That though repressed and moody with the weather 
Was none the less there ready to be freed 
And sing the wildflowers up from root and seed. 


[ 298 ] 



THE LOCKLESS DOOR 


It went many years, 

But at last came a knock, 
And I thought of the door 
With no lock to lock. 

I blew out the light, 

I tip-toed the floor, 

And raised both hands 
In prayer to the door. 

But the knock came again 
My window was wide, 

I climbed on the sill 
And descended outside. 

Back over the sill 
I bade a ‘Come in’ 

To whatever the knock 
At the door may have been. 

So at a knock 
I emptied my cage 
To hide in the world 
And alter with age. 


[ 299 ] 



THE NEED OF BEING VERSED IN 
COUNTRY THINGS 


The house had gone to bring again 
To the midnight sky a sunset glow. 

Now the chimney was all of the house that stood, 
Like a pistil after the petals go. 

The bam opposed across the way. 

That would have joined the house in flame 
Had it been the will of the wind, was left 
To bear forsaken the place’s name. 

No more it opened with all one end 
For teams that came by the stony road 
To drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs 
And brush the mow with the summer load. 

The birds that came to it through the air 
At broken windows flew out and in. 

Their murmur more like the sigh we sigh 
From too much dwelling on what has been. 

Yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf, 

And the aged elm, though touched with fire; 

And the dry pump flung up an awkward arm; 

And the fence post carried a strand of wire. 

For them there was really nothing sad. 

But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept, 
One had to be versed in country things 
Not to believe the phoebes wept. 


[ 300 ] 



WEST-RUNNING 

BROOK 




SPRING POOLS 


These pools that, though m forests, still reflect 
The total sky almost without defect, 

And like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver, 
Will like the flowers beside them soon be gone, 
And yet not out by any brook or rivei. 

But up by roots to bring dark foliage on 

The trees that have it in their pent-up buds 
To darken nature and be summei woods— 

Let them think twice before they use then powers 
To blot out and drink up and sweep away 
These flowery waters and these watery flowers 
From snow that melted only yesterday. 



THE FREEDOM OF THE MOON 


I’ve tried the new moon tilted m the air 
Above a hazy tree-and-farmhouse cluster 
As you might try a jewel m your hair 
I’ve tried it fine with little breadth of luster. 
Alone, or in one ornament combining 
With one first-water star almost as shining 

I put it shining anywhere I please 
By walking slowly on some evening later, 

I’ve pulled it from a crate of crooked trees, 

And brought it over glossy water, greater, 

And dropped it in, and seen the image wallow, 
The color run, all sorts of wonder follow. 


[ 304 ] 



THE ROSE FAMILY 


The rose is a rose, 

And was always a rose. 

But the theory now goes 
That the apple’s a rose, 

And the pear is, and so's 
The plum, I suppose. 

The dear only knows 
What will next prove a rose. 
You, of course, are a rose— 
But were always a rose. 



FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN 


Here come real stars to fill the upper skies. 
And heie on earth come emulating flies. 
That though they never equal stars m size, 
(And they were never really stars at heart) 
Achieve at times a very star-like start. 
Only, of course, they cant sustain the part 


[ 306 ] 



ATMOSPHERE 

INSCRIPTION FOR A GARDEN WALL 

Winds blow the open grassy places bleak, 
But where this old wall burns a sunny cheek. 
They eddy over it too toppling weak 
To blow the earth or anything self-clear. 
Moisture and color and odor thicken here. 
The hours of daylight gather atmosphere. 



DEVOTION 


The heart can think of no devotion 
Greater than being shore to the ocean— 
Holding the curve of one position. 
Counting an endless repetition. 


[ 308 ] 



ON GOING UNNOTICED 


As vain to raise a voice as a sigh 
In the tumult of free leaves on high 
What are you in the shadow of trees 
Engaged up there with the light and breeze? 

Less than the coral-root you know 
That is content with the daylight low. 

And has no leaves at all of its own, 

Whose spotted flowers hang meanly down. 

You grasp the bark by a nagged pleat, 

And look up small from the forest’s feet. 

The only leaf it drops goes wide, 

Your name not written on either side. 

You linger your little hour and are gone. 

And still the woods sweep leafily on. 

Not even missing the coral-root flower 



THE COCOON 


As far as I can see this autumn haze 

That spreadmg in the evening air both ways 

Makes the new moon look anything but new. 

And pours the elm-tree meadow full of blue. 

Is all the smoke from one poor house alone 
With but one chimney it can call its own, 

So close it will not light an early light, 

Keeping its life so close and out of sight 
No one for hours has set a foot outdoors 
So much as to take care of evening chores. 

The inmates may be lonely women-folk 
I want to tell them that with all this smoke 
They prudently are spinning their cocoon 
And anchoring it to an earth and moon 
From which no winter gale can hope to blow it,— 
Spinning their own cocoon did they but know it. 


[ 310 ] 



A PASSING GLIMPSE 


To Ridgely Torrence 
On Last Looking into His ‘Hespendes’ 

I often see flowers from a passing car 
That are gone before I can tell what they are 

I want to get out of the tram and go back 
To see what they were beside the track 

I name all the flowers I am sure they weren’t. 
Not fireweed loving where woods have burnt— 

Not bluebells gracing a tunnel mouth— 

Not lupine living on sand and drouth 

Was something brushed across my mind 
That no one on earth will ever find? 

Heaven gives its glimpses only to those 
Not m position to look too close. 



A PECK OF GOLD 


Dust always blowing about the town. 
Except when sea-fog laid it down. 
And I was one of the children told 
Some of the blowing dust was gold. 

All the dust the wind blew high 
Appeared like gold in the sunset sky, 
But I was one of the children told 
Some of the dust was really gold. 

Such was life in the Golden Gate. 
Gold dusted all we drank and ate. 
And I was one of the children told, 
“We all must eat our peck of gold.’ 


[ 312 ] 



ACCEPTANCE 


When the spent sun thxows up its rays on cloud 
And goes down burning into the gulf below. 

No voice m nature is heard to cry aloud 
At what has happened. Birds, at least, must know 1 
It is the change to darkness in the sky 
Murmuring something quiet in her breast, 

One bird begins to close a faded eye, * 

Or overtaken too far from his nest, , 

Hurrying low above the grove, some waif 
Swoops just in time to his remembered tree. 

At most he thinks or twitters softly, ‘Safe!/ 

Now let the night be dark for all of me. 

Let the night be too dark for me to see 
Into the future. Let what will be, be/ 



ONCE BY THE PACIFIC 


The shattered water made a misty din. 

Great waves looked over others coming in. 
And thought of doing something to the shore 
That water never did to land before. 

The clouds were low and hairy in the skies, 
Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes. 
You could not tell, and yet it looked as if 
The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff. 
The cliff in being backed by contment; 

It looked as if a night of dark intent 
Was coming, and not only a night, an age. 
Someone had better be prepared for rage. 
There would be more than ocean-water broken 
Before God’s last Put out the Light was spoken. 


[ 314 ] 



LODGED 


The ram to the wind said, 

‘You push and I’ll pelt ’ 

They so smote the garden bed 
That the flowers actually knelt. 
And lay lodged— though not dead. 
I know how the flowers felt. 



A MINOR BIRD 


I have wished a bird would fly away. 

And not sing by my house all day; 

Have clapped my hands at him from the door 
When it seemed as if I could bear no more. 

The fault must partly have been in me. 

The bird was not to blame for his key. 

And of course there must be something wrong 
In wanting to silence any song. 


[ 316 ] 



BEREFT 


Where had I heard this wind before 
Change like this to a deeper roai? 

What would it take my standing there for, 
Holding open a restive door, 

Looking down hill to a frothy shore? 
Summer was past and day was past 
Somber clouds in the west were massed. 
Out in the porch’s sagging floor. 

Leaves got up in a coil and hissed, 

Blindly struck at my knee and missed. 
Something sinister m the tone 
Told me my secret must be known: 

Word I was in the house alone 
Somehow must have gotten abroad. 

Word I was in my life alone, 

Word I had no one left but God. 



TREE AT MY WINDOW 


Tree at my window, window tiee, 

My sash is lowered when night comes on, 

But let there never be curtain drawn 
Between you and me 

Vague dream-head lifted out of the ground, 
And thing next most diffuse to cloud. 

Not all your light tongues talking aloud 
Could be profound. 

But, tree, I have seen you taken and tossed, 
And if you have seen me when I slept, 

You have seen me when I was taken and swept 
And all but lost 

That day she put our heads together. 

Fate had her imagination about her. 

Your head so much concerned with outer, 

Mine with inner, weather. 


[ 318 ] 



THE PEACEFUL SHEPHERD 


If heaven were to do again, 

And on the pasture bars, 

I leaned to line the figures m 
Between the dotted stars, 

I should be tempted to forget, 

I fear, the Crown of Rule, 

The Scales of Trade, the Cross of Faith, 
As hardly worth renewal. 

For these have governed in our lives, 
And see how men have warred 
The Cross, the Crown, the Scales may all 
As well have been the Sword. 



THE THATCH 


Out alone in the wmtei rain. 

Intent on giving and taking pam. 

But never was I far out of sight 
Of a certain upper-window hght. 

The light was what it was all about. 

I would not go m till the light went out, 

It would not go out till I came m. 

Well, we should see which one would win, 

We should see which one would be first to yield 
The world was a black invisible field. 

The rain by rights was snow for cold. 

The wind was another layer of mold 

But the strangest thing, in the thick old thatch, 

Where summer birds had been given hatch, 

Had fed m chorus, and lived to fledge. 

Some still were living in hermitage. 

And as I passed along the eaves. 

So low I brushed the straw with my sleeves, 

I flushed birds out of hole after hole, 

Into the darkness. It grieved my soul, 

It started a grief within a grief, 

To think their case was beyond relief— 

They could not go flying about m search 
Of their nest again, nor find a perch, 

They must brood where they fell in mulch and mire, 
Trusting feathers and inward fire 
Till daylight made it safe for a flyer. 

My greater grief was by so much reduced 
As I thought of them without nest or roost. 

That was how that grief started to melt. 

They tell me the cottage where we dwelt, 

[ 320 ] 



Its wind-torn thatch goes now unmended; 
Its life of hundreds of years has ended 
By letting the rain I knew outdoors 
In on to the upper chamber floors. 



A WINTER EDEN 


A winter garden in an alder swamp, 

Where conies now come out to sun and romp, 

As near a paradise as it can be 

And not melt snow or start a dormant tree. 

It lifts existence on a plane of snow 
One level higher than the earth below. 

One level nearer heaven overhead, 

And last year’s berries shinmg scarlet red. 

It lifts a gaunt luxuriating beast 
Where he can stietch and hold his highest feast 
On some wild apple tree’s young tender bark, 
What well may prove the year’s high girdle mark. 

So near to paradise all pairing ends: 

Here loveless birds now flock as winter friends, 
Content with bud-inspecting. They presume 
To say which buds are leaf and which are bloom. 

A feather-hammer gives a double knock 
This Eden day is done at two o’clock. 

An hour of winter day might seem too short 
To make it worth life’s while to wake and sport. 


[ 322 ] 



THE FLOOD 


Blood has been harder to dam back than water. 

Just when we think we have it impounded safe 
Behind new barner walls (and let it chafe'), 

It breaks away in some new kind of slaughter. 

We choose to say it is let loose by the devil. 

But power of blood itself releases blood 
It goes by might of being such a flood 
Held high at so unnatural a level. 

It will have outlet, brave and not so brave. 
Weapons of war and implements of peace 
Are but the pomts at which it finds release. 

And now it is once more the tidal wave 

That when it has swept by leaves summits stained. 

Oh, blood will out. It cannot be contained. 



ACQUAINTED WITH THE NIGHT 


I have been one acquainted with the night. 

I have walked out in ram— and back in rain. 

I have outwalked the furthest city light 

I have looked down the saddest city lane. 

I have passed by the watchman on his beat 
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain. 

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet 
When far away an interrupted cry 
Came over houses from another street, 

But not to call me back or say good-by; 

And further still at an unearthly height. 

One luminary clock against the sky 

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. 
I have been one acquainted with the night. 


[ 324 ] 



THE LOVELY SHALL BE CHOOSERS 


The Voice said, ‘Hurl her down!’ 

The Voices, ‘How far down?’ 

‘Seven levels of the world.’ 

‘How much time have we?’ 

‘Take twenty years. 

She would refuse love safe with wealth and honor! 
The lovely shall be choosers, shall they? 

Then let them choose!’ 

‘Then we shall let her choose?’ 

‘Yes, let her choose. 

Take up the task beyond her choosing.’ 

Invisible hands crowded on her shoulder 
In readiness to weigh upon her. 

But she stood straight still, 

In broad round ear-rings, gold and jet with pearls 
And broad round suchlike brooch. 

Her cheeks high colored, 

Proud and the pride of friends. 

The Voice asked, ‘You can let her choose?’ 

‘Yes, we can let her and still triumph.’ 

‘Do it by joys, and leave her always blameless. 

Be her first joy her weddmg, 

[ 325 ] 



That though a wedding, 

Is yet— well something they know, he and she. 

And after that her next joy 

That though she grieves, her gnef is secret. 

Those friends know nothing of her grief to make it shameful. 
Her third joy that though now they cannot help but know, 
They move in pleasure too far off 
To think much or much care. 

Give her a child at either knee for fourth joy 
To tell once and once only, for them never to forget. 

How once she walked in brightness, 

And make them see it m the winter firelight. 

But give her friends for then she dare not tell 
For their foregone incredulousness. 

And be her next joy this: 

Her never having deigned to tell them 
Make her among the humblest even 
Seem to them less than they are. 

Hopeless of being known for what she has been, 

Failing of being loved for what she is, 

Give her the comfort for her sixth of knowing 
She fails from strangeness to a way of life 
She came to from too high too late to learn. 

Then send some one with eyes to see 
And wonder at her where she is. 

And words to wonder in her hearing how she came there. 
But without time to linger for her story. 

Be her last joy her heart’s going out to this one 
So that she almost speaks. 

You know them— seven in all.’ 

‘Trust us,’ the Voices said.

WEST-RUNNING BROOK 


‘Fred, where is north?’ 


‘North? North is there, my love. 

The brook runs west.’ 


‘West-running Biook then call it.’ 
(West-running Brook men call it to this day ) 

“What does it thmk it’s doing running west 
When all the other country brooks flow east 
To reach the ocean? It must be the brook 
Can trust itself to go by contraries 
The way I can with you— and you with me— 

Because we’re— we’re— I don’t know what we are. 

What are we?’ 


‘Young or new?’ 


‘We must be something. 
We’ve said we two. Let’s change that to we three. 

As you and I are married to each other, 

We’ll both be married to the brook. We’ll build 
Our bridge across it, and the bridge shall be 
Our arm thrown over it asleep beside it. 

Look, look, it’s wavmg to us with a wave 
To let us know it hears me.’ 


‘Why, my dear, 

That wave’s been standing off this jut of shore—’ 
(The black stream, catching on a sunken rock, 
Flung backward on itself in one white wave, 
And the white water rode the black forever, 

[ 327 ] 



Not gaining but not losing, like a bird 
White featheis fiom the struggle of whose bieast 
Flecked the dark stream and flecked the darker pool 
Below the point, and were at last driven wrinkled 
In a white scarf against the far shore alders ) 

‘That wave’s been standing off this jut of shore 
Ever since riveis, I was going to say, 

Were made m heaven. It wasn’t waved to us.’ 

‘It wasn’t, yet it was. If not to you 
It was to me— in an annunciation.’ 

‘Oh, if you take it off to lady-land, 

As’t were the country of the Amazons 
We men must see you to the confines of 
And leave you there, ourselves forbid to enter,— 

It is your brook' I have no more to say.’ 

‘Yes, you have, too. Go on. You thought of something. 

‘Speaking of contraries, see how the brook 
In that white wave runs counter to itself. 

It is from that in water we were from 

Long, long before we were from any creature. 

Here we, in our impatience of the steps, 

Get back to the beginning of beginnings, 

The stream of everything that runs away. 

Some say existence like a Pirouot 
And Pirouette, forever in one place, 

Stands still and dances, but it runs away. 

It seriously, sadly, runs away 

To fill the abyss’ void with emptiness. 

It flows beside us in this water brook; 

[ 328 ] 



But it flows over us. It flows between us 
To separate us for a panic moment. 

It flows between us, over us, and with us. 

And it is time, strength, tone, light, life, and love— 
And even substance lapsing unsubstantial, 

The universal cataract of death 

That spends to nothingness— and unresisted. 

Save by some strange resistance in itself. 

Not just a swerving, but a throwing back. 

As if regret were in it and were sacred. 

It has this throwing backward on itself 
So that the fall of most of it is always 
Raising a little, sending up a little 
Our life runs down in sending up the clock. 

The brook runs down m sendmg up our life. 

The sun runs down in sending up the brook. 

And there is something sending up the sun. 

It is this backward motion toward the source. 
Against the stream, that most we see ourselves in. 
The tribute of the current to the source. 

It is from this in nature we are from. 

It is most us.’ 


'Today will be the day 

You said so.’ 


'No, today will be the day 
You said the brook was called West-running Brook.’ 

‘Today will be the day of what we both said.’ 


[ 329 ] 



SAND DUNES 


Sea waves are green and wet. 

But up from where they die. 

Rise others vaster yet, 

And those are brown and dry. 

They are the sea made land 
To come at the fisher town. 

And bury in solid sand 
The men she could not drown. 

She may know cove and cape. 
But she does not know mankind 
If by any change of shape, 

She hopes to cut off mind. 

Men left her a ship to sink: 

They can leave her a hut as well; 
And be but more free to think 
For the one more cast-off shell. 


[ 830 ] 



CANIS MAJOR 

The great Overdog 
That heavenly beast 
With a star in one eye. 

Gives a leap in the east. 

He dances upright 
All the way to the west 
And never once drops 
On his foiefeet to rest. 

I’m a poor underdog, 

But tonight I will bark 
With the great Overdog 
That romps through the dark. 


[ 331 ] 



A SOLDIER 


He is that fallen lance that lies as hurled, 

That lies unhfted now, come dew, come rust, 

But still lies pointed as it plowed the dust. 

If we who sight along it round the world, 

See nothing worthy to have been its mark, 

It is because like men we look too near, 
Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere. 

Our missiles always make too short an arc. 

They fall, they rip the grass, they intersect 
The curve of earth, and striking, break their own; 
They make us cringe for metal-point on stone. 
But this we know, the obstacle that checked 
And tripped the body, shot the spirit on 
Further than target ever showed or shone. 


f 332] 



IMMIGRANTS 


No ship of all that undei sail or steam 
Have gathered people to us more and more 
But Pilgrim-manned the Mayflower in a dream 
Has been her anxious convoy in to shore. 


[ 333 ] 



HANNIBAL 


Was there ever a cause too lost, 

Ever a cause that was lost too long, 

Or that showed with the lapse of time too vain 
For the generous tears of youth and song? 


[ 334 ] 



THE FLOWER BOAT 


The fisherman’s swapping a yam for a yam 
Under the hand of the village barber. 

And here in the angle of house and bam 
His deep-sea dory has found a harbor. 

At anchor she rides the sunny sod 
As full to the gunnel of flowers growing 
As ever she turned her home with cod 
From George’s bank when winds were blowing. 

And I judge from that Elysian freight 
That all they ask is rougher weather, 

And dory and master will sail by fate 
To seek for the Happy Isles together. 


[S35J 



THE TIMES TABLE 


More than halfway up the pass 
Was a spring with a broken drinking glass. 
And whether the farmer drank or not 
His mare was sure to observe the spot 
By cramping the wheel on a water-bar, 
Turning her forehead with a star. 

And straining her ribs for a monster sigh, 
To which the farmer would make reply, 

‘A sigh for every so many breath, 

And for every so many sigh a death. 

That’s what I always tell my wife 
Is the multiplication table of life.’ 

The saying may be ever so true; 

But it’s just the kind of a thing that you 
Nor I, nor nobody else may say. 

Unless our purpose is doing harm. 

And then I know of no better way 
To close a road, abandon a farm, 

Reduce the births of the human race, 

And brmg back nature in people’s place. 


[ 336 ] 



THE INVESTMENT 


Over back where they speak of life as staying 
('You couldn’t call it living, for it ain’t’). 

There was an old, old house renewed with paint, 
And in it a piano loudly playing. 

Out in the plowed ground in the cold a digger, 
Among unearthed potatoes standing still. 

Was counting winter dinners, one a hill. 

With half an ear to the piano’s vigor. 

All that piano and new paint back there. 

Was it some money suddenly come into? 

Or some extravagance young love had been to? 
Or old love on an impulse not to care— 

Not to sink under being man and wife. 

But get some color and music out of life? 


[ 337 ] 



THE LAST MOWING 


There’s a place called Far-away Meadow 
We never shall mow in again, 

Or such is the talk at the farmhouse: 

The meadow is finished with men. 

Then now is the chance for the flowers 
That can’t stand mowers and plowers. 

It must be now, though, in season 
Before the not mowing brings trees on. 
Before trees, seeing the openmg, 

March mto a shadowy claim. 

The trees are all I’m afraid of, 

That flowers can’t bloom in the shade of; 
It’s no more men I’m afraid of; 

The meadow is done with the tame. 

The place for the moment is ours 
For you, oh tumultuous flowers. 

To go to waste and go wild m. 

All shapes and colors of flowers, 

I needn’t call you by name. 


[ 338 ] 



THE BIRTHPLACE 


Here furtbei up the mountain slope 
Than there was ever any hope, 

My father built, enclosed a spimg. 

Strung chains of wall round every thing, 
Subdued the growth of earth to grass, 

And brought our various lives to pass. 

A dozen girls and boys we were. 

The mountain seemed to like the stir. 

And made of us a little while— 

With always something in her smile. 
Today she wouldn’t know our name 
(No girl’s, of course, has stayed the same. 
The mountain pushed us off her knees. 
And now her lap is full of trees. 


[ 339 ] 



THE DOOR IN THE DARK 


In going from room to room in the dark, 

I reached out blindly to save my face, 
But neglected, however lightly, to lace 
My fingers and close my arms in an arc. 

A slim door got in past my guard. 

And hit me a blow in the head so hard 
I had my native simile jarred. 

So people and things don’t pair any more 
With what they used to pair with before. 


[ 340 ] 



DUST IN THE EYES 


If, as they say, some dust thrown m mv eyes 
Will keep my talk from getting overwise. 

I’m not the one for putting off the proof. 

Let it be overwhelming, off a roof 
And round a corner, blizzard snow for dust, 
And blmd me to a standstill if it must. 


[ 341 ] 



SITTING BY A BUSH IN BROAD 
SUNLIGHT 


When I spread out my hand here today, 

I catch no more than a ray 

To feel of between thumb and fingers. 

No lasting effect of it lingers 

There was one time and only the one 
When dust really took in the sun; 

And from that one intake of fire 
All creatures still warmly suspire. 

And if men have watched a long time 
And never seen sun-smitten shme 
Again come to life and crawl off. 

We must not be too ready to scoff. 

God once declared he was true 
And then took the veil and withdrew. 

And remember how final a hush 
Then descended of old on the bush. 

God once spoke to people by name. 

The sun once imparted its flame. 

One impulse persists as our breath, 

The other persists as our faith. 


[ 342 ] 



THE ARMFUL 


For every parcel I stoop down to seize, 

I lose some other off my arms and knees. 

And the whole pile is shppmg, bottles, buns, 
Extremes too hard to comprehend at once. 
Yet nothing I should care to leave behind 
With all I have to hold with, hand and mind 
And heart, if need be, I will do my best 
To keep their building balanced at my breast. 
I crouch down to prevent them as they fall, 
Then sit down in the middle of them all. 

I had to drop the armful in the road 
And try to stack them m a better load. 


[ 343 ] 



WHAT FIFTY SAID 


When I was young my teachers were the old. 

I gave up fire for form till I was cold 
I suffered like a metal being cast. 

I went to school to age to leam the past. 

Now I am old my teachers are the young. 

What can’t be molded must be cracked and sprung. 
I strain at lessons fit to start a suture. 

I go to school to youth to learn the future. 


[ 344 ] 



RIDERS 


The surest thing there is is we are riders. 

And though none too successful at it, guiders. 
Through everything presented, land and tide 
And now the very air, of what we nde. 

What is this talked-of mystery of birth 
But being mounted bareback on the earth? 
We can just see the infant up astride, 

His small fist buried in the bushy hide. 

There is our wildest mount— a headless horse. 
But though it runs unbridled off its course, 
And all our blandishments would seem defied, 
We have ideas yet that we haven’t tried. 


[ 345 ] 



ON LOOKING UP BY CHANCE AT 
THE CONSTELLATIONS 


You’ll wait a long, long tune for anything much 
To happen m heaven beyond the floats of cloud 
And the Northern Lights that run like tingling nerves. 
The sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch. 
Nor strike out fire from each other, nor crash out loud. 
The planets seem to interfere in their curves. 

But nothing ever happens, no harm is done 
We may as well go patiently on with our life, 

And look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun 
For the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane. 

It is true the longest drouth will end in ram. 

The longest peace m China will end in strife. 

Still it wouldn’t reward the watcher to stay awake 
In hopes of seemg the calm of heaven break 
On his particular time and personal sight. 

That calm seems certainly safe to last tonight. 


[ 346 ] 



THE BEAR 


The bear puts both arms around the tree above her 
And draws it down as if it weie a lover 
And its choke cherries lips to kiss good-by. 

Then lets it snap back upright m the sky. 

Her next step rocks a boulder on the wall 
(She’s making her cross-country in the fall). 

Her great weight creaks the barbed-wire in its staples 
As she flings over and off down through the maples, 
Leaving on one wire tooth a lock of hair. 

Such is the uncaged progress of the bear. 

The world has room to make a bear feel free, 

The universe seems cramped to you and me. 

Man acts more like the poor bear m a cage 
That all day fights a nervous inward rage. 

His mood rejecting all his mind suggests. 

He paces back and forth and never rests 
The toe-nail click and shuffle of his feet. 

The telescope at one end of his beat. 

And at the other end the microscope. 

Two in struments of nearly equal hope. 

And in conjunction giving quite a spread. 

Or if he rests from scientific tread, 

’Tis only to sit back and sway his head 
Through ninety odd degrees of arc, it seems. 

Between two metaphysical extremes. 

He sits back on his fundamental butt 
With lifted snout and eyes (if any) shut, 

(He almost looks religious but he’s not), 

And back and forth he sways from cheek to cheek. 

At one extreme agreeing with one Greek, 

At the other agreeing with another Greek 

[ 347 ] 



Which may be thought, but only so to speak. 
A baggy figure, equally pathetic 
When sedentary and when peripatetic. 


[S48] 



THE EGG AND THE MACHINE 


He gave the solid rail a hateful kick. 

From far away there came an answering tick 
And then another tick He knew the code 
His hate had roused an engme up the road. 

He wished when he had had the track alone 
He had attacked it with a club or stone 
And bent some rail wide open like a switch 
So as to wreck the engine in the ditch. 

Too late though, now, he had himself to thank. 
Its click was rising to a nearer clank. 

Here it came breasting like a horse m skirts. 

(He stood well back for fear of scalding squirts ) 
Then for a moment all there was was size 
Confusion and a roar that drowned the cries 
He raised against the gods in the machine. 

Then once again the sandbank lay serene. 

The travelers eye picked up a turtle trail, 
Between the dotted feet a streak of tail, 

And followed it to where he made out vague 
But certain signs of buried turtle’s egg, 

And probing with one finger not too rough. 

He found suspicious sand, and sure enough, 
The pocket of a little turtle mine. 

If there was one egg in it there were nine. 
Torpedo-like, with shell of gritty leather 
All packed in sand to wait the trump together. 
•You’d better not disturb me any more,’ 

He told the distance, ‘I am armed for war. 

The next machine that has the power to pass 
Will get this plasm in its goggle glass.' 


[ 349 ] 




A 

FURTHER 

RANGE 




TAKEN DOUBLY 




A LONE STRIKER 


The swinging mill bell changed its rate 
To tolling like the count of fate, 

And though at that the tardy ran, 

One failed to make the closing gate. 
There was a law of God or man 
That on the one who came too late 
The gate for half an hour be locked. 

His time be lost, his pittance docked. 

He stood rebuked and unemployed. 

The straining mill began to shake. 

The mill, though many, many eyed, 

Had eyes inscrutably opaque, 

So that he couldn’t look inside 
To see if some forlorn machine 
Was standing idle for his sake. 

(He couldn’t hope its heart would break.) 

And yet he thought he saw the scene: 
The air was full of dust of wool. 

A thousand yams were under pull, 

But pull so slow, with such a twist, 

All day from spool to lesser spool, 

It seldom overtaxed their strength; 

They safely grew in slender length. 

And if one broke by any chance. 

The spinner saw it at a glance 
The spinner still was there to spin. 

That’s where the human still came in. 
Her deft hand showed with finger rings 
Among the harp-like spread of strings. 
She caught the pieces end to end 
[ 355 ] 



And, with a touch that never missed, 

Not so much tied as made them blend. 
Mans ingenuity was good. 

He saw it plainly where he stood, 

Yet found it easy to resist. 

He knew another place, a wood. 

And in it, tall as trees, were cliffs; 

And if he stood on one of these, 

’Twould be among the tops of trees, 

Their upper branches round him wreathing, 
Their breathing mingled with his breathing. 
If— if he stood! Enough of ifs! 

He knew a path that wanted walking; 

He knew a spring that wanted drinking, 

A thought that wanted further thinking; 

A love that wanted re-renewing. 

Nor was this just a way of talking 
To save him the expense of doing. 

With him it boded action, deed. 

The factory was very fine; 

He wished it all the modern speed. 

Yet, after all, ’twas not divine. 

That is to say, ’twas not a church. 

He never would assume that he’d 
Be any institution’s need. 

But he said then and still would say 
If there should ever come a day 
When industry seemed like to die 
Because he left it in the lurch. 

Or even merely seemed to pine 
For want of his approval, why, 

Come get him— they knew where to search. 
[ 356 ] 



TWO TRAMPS IN MUD TIME 


Out of the mud two strangers came 
And caught me splitting wood m the yard. 

And one of them put me off my aim 
By hailing cheerily ‘Hit them hard!’ 

I knew pretty well why he dropped behind 
And let the other go on a way. 

I knew pretty well what he had in mind: 

He wanted to take my job for pay. 

Good blocks of oak it was I split, 

As large around as the chopping block; 

And every piece I squarely hit 
Fell splinterless as a cloven rock. 

The blows that a life of self-control 
Spares to strike for the common good 
That day, giving a loose to my soul, 

I spent on the unimportant wood. 

The sun was warm but the wind was chill. 

You know how it is with an April day 
When the sun is out and the wind is still, 

You’re one month on in the middle of May. 

But if you so much as dare to speak, 

A cloud comes over the sunlit arch, 

A wind comes off a frozen peak, 

And you’re two months back in the middle of March. 

A bluebird comes tenderly up to alight 
And turns to the wind to unruffle a plume 
His song so pitched as not to excite 
A single flower as yet to bloom. 

[ 357 ] 



It is snowing a flake: and he half knew 
Winter was only playing possum. 

Except in color he isn’t blue, 

But he V'ouldn’t advise a thing to blossom. 

The water for which we may have to look 
In summertime with a witching-wand. 

In every wheelrut’s now a brook. 

In every print of a hoof a pond. 

Be glad of water, but don’t forget 
The lurking frost in the earth beneath 
That will steal forth after the sun is set 
And show on the water its crystal teeth. 

The time when most I loved my task 
These two must make me love it more 
By coming with what they came to ask. 

You’d think I never had felt before 
The weight of an ax-head poised aloft, 

The grip on earth of outspread feet. 

The life of muscles rocking soft 
And smooth and moist in vernal heat. 

Out of the woods two hulking tramps 
(From sleeping God knows where last night, 
But not long since in the lumber camps) 

They thought all chopping was theirs of right 
Men of the woods and lumberjacks, 

They judged me by their appropriate tool. 
Except as a fellow handled an ax, 

They had no way of knowing a fool. 

Nothing on either side was said. 

They knew they had but to stay their stay 
And all their logic would fill my head: 

[ 358 ] 



As that I had no right to play 

With what was another man’s work for gain. 

My nght might be love but theirs was need. 

And where the two exist m twain 

Theirs was the better right— agieed. 

But yield who will to their separation, 

My object in living is to unite 
My avocation and my vocation 
As my two eyes make one in sight. 

Only where love and need are one. 

And the work is play for mortal stakes, 

Is the deed ever really done 
For Heaven and the future’s sakes. 


[ 359 ] 



THE WHITE-TAILED HORNET 


The white-tailed hornet lives in a balloon 
That floats against the ceiling of the woodshed. 
The exit he comes out at hke a bullet 
Is like the pupil of a pointed gun. 

And having power to change his aim in flight. 
He comes out more unerring than a bullet. 
Verse could be written on the certainty 
With which he penetrates my best defense 
Of whirling hands and arms about the head 
To stab me m the sneeze-nerve of a nostril. 

Such is the instinct of it I allow. 

Yet how about the msect certainty 

That in the neighborhood of home and children 

Is such an execrable judge of motives 

As not to recognize in me the exception 

I like to think I am in everything— 

One who would never hang above a bookcase 
His Japanese crepe-paper globe for trophy? 

He stung me first and stung me afterward. 

He rolled me off the field head over heels. 

And would not hsten to my explanations. 

That's when I went as visitor to his house. 

As visitor at my house he is better. 

Hawking for flies about the kitchen door, 

In at one door perhaps and out another, 

Trust him then not to put you in the wrong. 

He won’t misunderstand your freest movements. 
Let him light on your skin unless you mind 
So many prickly grappling feet at once. 

He’s after the domesticated fly 

[ 360 ] 



To feed his thumping grubs as big as he is. 

Here he is at his best, but even here— 

I watched him where he swooped, he pounced, he struck; 
But what he found he had was just a nailhead. 

He struck a second time. Another nailhead. 

‘Those are just nailheads. Those are fastened down.’ 

Then disconcerted and not unannoyed, 

He stooped and struck a httle huckleberry 
The way a player curls around a football. 

Wrong shape, wrong color, and wrong scent,’ I said. 

The huckleberry rolled him on his head. 

At last it was a fly. He shot and missed. 

And the fly circled round him in derision. 

But for the fly he might have made me think 
He had been at his poetry, comparing 
N ailhe ad with fly and fly with huckleberry: 

How like a fly, how very like a fly. 

But the real fly he missed would never do 
The missed fly made me dangerously skeptic. 

Won’t this whole instinct matter bear revision? 

Won’t almost any theory bear revision? 

To err is human, not to, animal 

Or so we pay the comphment to instinct. 

Only too liberal of our compliment 
That really takes away instead of gives. 

Our worship, humor, conscientiousness 
Went long since to the dogs under the table. 

And served us right for having instituted 
Downward comparisons. As long on earth 
As our comparisons were stoutly upward 
With gods and angels, we were men at least, 

But little lower than the gods and angels. 

[ 361 ] 



But once comparisons were yielded downward, 
Once we began to see our images 
Reflected in the mud and even dust, 

’Twas disillusion upon disillusion. 

We were lost piecemeal to the animals, 

Like people thrown out to delay the wolves. 
Nothing but fallibility was left us. 

And this day’s work made even that seem doubtful 


[ 362 ] 



A BLUE RIBBON AT AMESBURY 


Such a fine pullet ought to go 
All coiffured to a winter show. 

And be exhibited, and win. 

The answer is this one has been— 

And come with all her honois home 
Her golden leg, her coral comb, 

Her fluff of plumage, white as chalk. 
Her style, were all the fancy’s talk. 

It seems as if you must have heard. 
She scored an almost perfect bird. 

In her we make ourselves acquainted 
With one a Sewell might have painted 

Here common with the flock again, 

At home in her abiding pen, 

She Imgers feedmg at the trough. 

The last to let night drive her off. 

The one who gave her ankle-band. 
Her keeper, empty pail in hand. 

He hngers too, averse to slight 
His chores for all the wintry night. 

He leans against the dusty wall, 
Immured almost beyond recall, 

A depth past many swinging doors 
And many litter-muffled floors. 

He meditates the breeder’s art. 

He has a half a mind to start, 

[ 363 ] 



With her for Mother Eve, a race 
That shall all living things displace. 

Tis ritual with her to lay 
The full six days, then rest a day; 

At which rate bariing broodiness 
She well may score an egg-success. 

The gatherer can always tell 

Her well-turned egg’s brown sturdy shell, 

As safe a vehicle of seed 

As is vouchsafed to feathered breed. 

No human specter at the feast 
Can scant or hurry her the least. 

She takes her time to take her fill. 

She whets a sleepy sated bill. 

She gropes across the pen alone 
To peck herself a precious stone. 

She waters at the patent fount. 

And so to roost, the last to mount. 

The roost is her extent of flight. 

Yet once she rises to the height. 

She shoulders with a wing so strong 
She makes the whole flock move along. 

The night is setting in to blow. 

It scours the windowpane with snow. 

But barely gets from them or her 
For comment a complacent chirr. 

The lowly pen is yet a hold 
Against the dark and wind and cold 
To give a prospect to a plan 
And warrant prudence in a man.

A DRUMLIN WOODCHUCK 


One thing has a shelving bank. 
Another a rotting plank, 

To give it cozier skies 

And make up for its lack of size. 

My own strategic retreat 
Is where two rocks almost meet. 
And still more secure and snug, 

A two-door burrow I dug. 

With those in mind at my back 
I can sit forth exposed to attack 
As one who shrewdly pretends 
That he and the world are friends. 

All we who prefer to live 
Have a little whistle we give. 

And flash, at the least alarm 
We dive down under the farm. 

We allow some time for guile 
And don’t come out for a while 
Either to eat or drink. 

We take occasion to think. 

And if after the hunt goes past 
And the double-barreled blast 
(Like war and pestilence 
And the loss of common sense). 

If I can with confidence say 
That still for another day, 

[ 365 ] 



Or even another year, 

I will be there for you, my dear. 

It will be because, though small 
As measured against the All, 

I have been so instinctively thorough 
About my crevice and burrow.

THE GOLD HESPERIDEE 


Square Matthew Hale s young grafted apple tree 
Began to blossom at the age of five, 

And after having entertained the bee, 

And cast its flowers and all the stems but three, 

It set itself to keep those three alive; 

And downy wax the three began to thrive. 

They had just given themselves a little twist 
And turned from looking up and being kissed 
To looking down and yet not being sad. 

When came Square Hale with Let’s see what we had 
And two was all he counted (one he missed\ 

But two for a beginning wasn’t bad. 

His little Matthew, also five years old, 

Was led mto the presence of the tree 
And raised among the leaves and duly told, 

We mustn’t touch them yet, but see and seel 
And what was green would by and by be gold. 

Their name was called the Gold Hespendee. 

As regularly as he went to feed the pig 
Or milk the cow, he visited the fruit. 

The dew of night and morning on his boot. 

Dearer to him than any barnyard brute, 

Each swung in danger on its slender twig, 

A bubble on a pipe-stem growing big. 

Long since they swung as three instead of two— 
One more, he thought, to take him safely through. 
Three made it certain nothing Fate could do 
With codlin moth or rusty parasite 
Would keep him now from proving with a bite 
That the name Gold Hesperidee was right. 

[ 367 ] 



And so he brought them to the verge of frost. 

But one day when the foliage all went swish 
With autumn and the fruit was rudely tossed, 

He thought no special goodness could be lost 
If he fulfilled at last his summer wish. 

And saw them picked unbruised and in a dish. 

Where they could ripen safely to the eating. 

But when he came to look, no apples there 
Under, or on the tree, or anywhere, 

And the hght-natured tree seemed not to care! 

’Twas Sunday and Square Hale was dressed for meeting 
The final summons into church was beating. 

Just as he was without an uttered sound 
At those who’d done him such a wrong as that. 

Square Matthew Hale took off his Sunday hat 
And ceremoniously laid it on the ground, 

And leaping on it with a solemn bound, 

Danced slowly on it till he trod it flat. 

Then suddenly he saw the thing he did, 

And looked around to see if he was seen. 

This was the sin that Ahaz was forbid 
(The meaning of the passage had been hid): 

To look upon the tree when it was green 
And worship apples. What else could it mean? 

God saw him dancing in the orchard path. 

But mercifully kept the passing crowd 
From witnessing the fault of one so proud. 

And so the story wasn’t told m Gath; 

In gratitude for which Square Matthew vowed 
To walk a graver man restrained in wrath. 

[ 368 ] 



IN TIME OF CLOUDBURST 


Let the downpour roil and toil! 

The worst it can do to me 
Is carry some garden soil 
A little nearer the sea. 

’Tis the world-old way of the rain 
When it comes to a mountain farm 
To exact for a present gain 
A little of future harm. 

And the harm is none too sure, 

For when all that was rotted rich 
Shall be in the end scoured poor. 

When my garden has gone down (iitch. 

Some force has but to apply, 

And summits shall be immersed. 

The bottom of seas raised dry— 

The slope of the earth reversed. 

Then all I need do is run 
To the other end of the slope, 

And on tracts laid new to the sun, 
Begm all over to hope. 

Some worn old tool of my own 
Will be turned up by the plow, 

The wood of it changed to stone, 

But as ready to wield as now. 

May my application so close 
To so endless a repetition 
Not make me tired and morose 
And resentful of man’s condition. 

[ 369 ] 



A ROADSIDE STAND 


The little old house was out with a little new shed 
In front at the edge of the road where the traffic sped, 

A roadside stand that too pathetically plead, 

It would not be fair to say for a dole of bread. 

But for some of the money, the cash, whose flow supports 
The flower of cities from sinking and withering faint. 

The pohshed traffic passed with a mind ahead, 

Or if ever aside a moment, then out of sorts 
At having the landscape marred with the artless paint 
Of signs that with N turned wrong and S turned wrong 
Offered for sale wild berries in wooden quarts, 

Or crook-necked golden squash with silver warts, 

Or beauty rest in a beautiful mountain scene. 

You have the money, but if you want to be mean, 

Why keep your money (this crossly), and go along. 

The hurt to the scenery wouldn’t be my complaint 
So much as the trusting sorrow of what is unsaid: 

Here far from the city we make our roadside stand 
And ask for some city money to feel in hand 
To try if it will not make our being expand. 

And give us the life of the moving pictures’ promise 
That the party in power is said to be keeping from us. 

It is in the news that all these pitiful kin 

Are to be bought out and mercifully gathered in 

To live in villages next to the theater and store 

Where they won’t have to think for themselves any more; 

While greedy good-doers, beneficent beasts of prey. 

Swarm over their lives enforcing benefits 

That are calculated to soothe them out of their wits, 


[ 370 ] 



And by teaching them how to sleep the sleep all day, 
Destioy their sleeping at night the ancient way. 

Sometimes I feel myself I can hardly bear 
The thought of so much childish longing in vam, 

The sadness that lurks near the open window there. 

That waits all day in almost open piayer 

For the squeal of brakes, the sound of a stopping car, 

Of all the thousand selfish cars that pass, 

Just one to inquire what a farmer’s puces are. 

And one did stop, but only to plow up grass 
In using the yard to back and turn around, 

And another to ask the way to where it was bound, 

And another to ask could they sell it a gallon of gas 
They couldn’t (this crossly) : they had none, didn’t it see? 

No, m country money, the country scale of gain, 

The requisite lift of spirit has never been found, 

Or so the voice of the country seems to complam. 

I can’t help owning the great rehef it would be 
To put these people at one stroke out of their pain. 

And then next day as I come back mto the sane, 

I wonder how I should like you to come to me 
And offer to put me gently out of my pain. 



DEPARTMENTAL 


An ant on the tablecloth 
Ran into a dormant moth 
Of many times his size 
He showed not the least surprise. 
His business wasn’t with such. 

He gave it scarcely a touch, 

And was off on his duty run. 

Yet if he encountered one 
Of the hive’s enquiry squad 
Whose work is to find out God 
And the nature of time and space. 
He would put him onto the case. 
Ants are a curious race; 

One crossmg with hurried tread 
The body of one of their dead 
Isn’t given a moment’s arrest— 
Seems not even impressed. 

But he no doubt reports to any 
With whom he crosses antennae, 
And they no doubt report 
To the higher up at court. 

Then word goes forth in Formic: 
‘Death’s come to Jerry McCormic, 
Our selfless forager Jerry. 

Will the special Janizary 
Whose office it is to bury 
The dead of the commissary 
Go bring him home to his people. 
Lay him in state on a sepal. 

Wrap him for shroud in a petal. 
Embalm him with ichor of nettle. 
[ 372 ] 



This is the word of your Queen ’ 
And presently on the scene 
Appears a solemn mortician, 

And taking formal position 
With feelers calmly atwiddle, 
Seizes the dead by the middle, 
And heavmg him high in air, 
Carries him out of there. 

No one stands round to stare. 

It is nobody else’s affair. 

It couldn’t be called ungentle. 

But how thoroughly departmental. 


[ 373 ] 



THE OLD BARN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FOGS 


Where’s this barn’s house? It never had a house, 

Or joined with sheds in ring-around a dooryard 
The hunter scuffling leaves goes by at dusk, 

The gun reversed that he went out with shouldered. 
The harvest moon and then the hunter’s moon 
Well, the moon after that came one at last 
To close this outpost barn and close the season. 

The fur-thing, muff-thing, rocking in and out 
Across the threshold in the twilight fled him. 

He took the props down used for propping open, 

And set them up again for propping shut, 

The wide-spread double doors two stories high. 

The advantage-disadvantage of these doors 

Was that tramp taking sanctuary there 

Must leave them unlocked to betray his presence. 

They could be locked but from the outside only. 

There is a fellow on the ocean now 
Or down a mine or at the mill (I met him) 

Who slept there in a mow of meadow hay 
One night (he told me). And the bam he meant 
Was the one I meant. Our details agreed. 

We said Well twice to what we had in common, 

The old barn at the bottom of the fogs. 

Its only windows were the crevices 
All up and down it. So that waking there 
Next morning to the light of day was more 
Like waking in a cage of silver bars. 

Its locks were props— and that reminded him. 

Trust him to have his bitter politics 

Against his unacquaintances the rich 

Who sleep in houses of their own, though mortgaged. 

[ 374 ] 



Conservatives, they don’t know what to save. 
Consider what they treasure undei glass. 

Yet leave such lovely shafts outdoois to perish. 
Would someone only act in time we yet 
Might see them on a rack like famous oars. 

Their label Prop-locks, only specimens 
In chestnut now become a precious wood 
As relic of a vanished race of trees— 

When these go there will be none to replace them. 
Yes, right I was the locks were props outside; 

And it had almost given him troubled dreams 
To think that though he could not lock himself in. 
The cheapest tramp that came along that way 
Could mischievously lock him in to stay. 



ON THE HEART’S BEGINNING TO CLOUD 
THE MIND 


Something I saw or thought I saw 
In the desert at midnight in Utah, 

Looking out of my lower berth 
At moonlit sky and moonlit earth. 

The sky had here and there a star; 

The earth had a single light afar, 

A flickering, human pathetic light. 

That was maintained against the night. 

It seemed to me, by the people there. 

With a God-forsaken brute despair. 

It would flutter and fall in half an hour 
Like the last petal off a flower. 

But my heart was beginning to cloud my mind. 

I knew a tale of a better kind. 

That far light flickers because of trees. 

The people can bum it as long as they please: 
And when their interests in it end, 

They can leave it to someone else to tend. 

Come back that way a summer hence, 

I should find it no more no less intense. 

I pass, but scarcely pass no doubt, 

When one will say, 'Let us put it out.’ 

The other without demur agrees. 

They can keep it burning as long as they please, 
They can put it out whenever they please. 

One looks out last from the darkened room 
At the shiny desert with spots of gloom 
That might be people and are but cedar, 

Have no purpose, have no leader, 

Have never made the first move to assemble, 

[ 376 ] 



And so are nothing to make her tremble. 
She can think of places that are not thus 
Without indulging a ‘Not for us!’ 

Life is not so sinister-grave. 

Matter of fact has made them brave. 

He is husband, she is wife. 

She fears not him, they fear not life. 

They know where another light has been 
And more than one to theirs akin, 

But earlier out for bed tomght, 

So lost on me in my surface flight. 

This I saw when waking late. 

Going by at a railroad rate, 

Looking through wreaths of engme smoke 
Far into the lives of other folk. 


[ 377 ] 



THE FIGURE IN THE DOORWAY 


The grade surmounted, we were riding high 
Through level mountains nothing to the eye 
But scrub oak, scrub oak and the lack of earth 
That kept the oaks from getting any girth. 

But as through the monotony we ran, 

We came to where there was a living man. 

His great gaunt figure filled his cabin door. 

And had he fallen inward on the floor. 

He must have measured to the further wall. 

But we who passed were not to see him fall. 

The miles and miles he lived from anywhere 
Were evidently somethmg he could bear. 

He stood unshaken, and if grim and gaunt, 

It was not necessarily from want. 

He had the oaks for heating and for light. 

He had a hen, he had a pig in sight. 

He had a well, he had the rain to catch. 

He had a ten-by-twenty garden patch. 

Nor did he lack for common entertainment. 

That I assume was what our passing train meant 
He could look at us in our diner eating, 

And if so moved uncurl a hand in greeting. 


[ 378 ] 



AT WOODWARD’S GARDENS 


A boy, presuming on his intellect, 

Once showed two little monkeys in a cage 
A burning-glass they could not understand 
And never could be made to undei stand 
Words are no good, to say it was a lens 
For gathering solar rays would not have helped 
But let him show them how the weapon worked. 
He made the sun a pin-point on the nose 
Of first one, then the other till it brought 
A look of puzzled dimness to their eyes 
That blinking could not seem to blink away. 

They stood arms laced together at the bars. 

And exchanged troubled glances over life. 

One put a thoughtful hand up to his nose 
As if reminded— or as if perhaps 
Within a million years of an idea. 

He got his purple little knuckles stung. 

The already known had once more been confirmed 
By psychological experiment. 

And that were all the finding to announce 
Had the boy not presumed too close and long. 
There was a sudden flash of arm, a snatch. 

And th i glass was the monkeys’, not the boy’s. 
Precipitately they retired back cage 
And instituted an investigation 
On their part, though without the needed insight. 
They bit the glass and listened for the flavor. 

They broke the handle and the binding off it. 

Then none the wiser, frankly gave it up, 

And having hid it in their bedding straw 
Against the day of prisoners’ ennui, 

[ 379 ] 



Came dryly forward to the bars again 
To answer for themselves: Who said it mattered 
What monkeys did or didn’t understand? 

They might not understand a burning-glass. 
They might not understand the sun itself. 

It’s knowing what to do with things that counts.

A RECORD STRIDE 


In a Vermont bedroom closet 

With a door of two broad boards 

And for back wall a crumbling old chimney 

(And that’s what their toes are towards), 

I have a pair of shoes standing. 

Old rivals of sagging leather, 

Who once kept surpassing each other. 

But now live even together. 

They listen for me in the bedroom 
To ask me a thing or two 
About who is too old to go walking 
With too much stress on the who. 

I wet one last year at Montauk 
For a hat I had to save. 

The other I wet at the Cliff House 
In an extra-vagant wave. 

Two entirely different grandchildren 
Got me into my double adventure. 

But when they grow up and can read this 
I hope they won’t take it for censure. 

I touch my tongue to the shoes now 
And unless my sense is at fault, 

On one I can taste Atlantic, 

On the other Pacific, salt. 

One foot in each great ocean 
Is a record stride or stretch. 

The authentic shoes it was made in 
I should sell for what they would fetch. 
[ 381 ] 



But instead I proudly devote them 
To my museum and muse; 

So the thick-skins needn’t act thin-skinned 
About being past-active shoes. 

And I ask all to try to forgive me 
For being as over-elated 
As if I had measured the country 
And got the United States stated.

TAKEN SINGLY 




LOST IN HEAVEN 


The clouds, the source of rain, one stormy night 
Offered an opening to the source of dew, 

Which I accepted with impatient sight, 

Looking for my old skymarks in the blue. 

But stars were scarce m that part of the sky. 

And no two were of the same constellation— 

No one was bright enough to identify. 

So ’twas with not ungrateful consternation, 

Seeing myself well lost once more, I sighed, 
‘Where, where in Heaven am I? But don’t tell mel 
Oh, opening clouds, by opening on me wide. 

Let’s let my heavenly lostness overwhelm me.’ 


[ 385 ] 



DESERT PLACES 


Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast 
In a field I looked into going past, 

And the ground almost covered smooth in snow, 
But a few weeds and stubble showing last. 

The woods around it have it— it is theirs. 

All animals are smothered m their lairs. 

I am too absent-spirited to count; 

The loneliness includes me unawares. 

And lonely as it is that loneliness 
Will be more lonely ere it will be less— 

A blanker whiteness of benighted snow 
With no expression, nothing to express. 

They cannot scare me with their empty spaces 
Between stars— on stars where no human race is. 

I have it in me so much nearer home 
To scare myself with my own desert places. 


[ 386 ] 



LEAVES COMPARED WITH FLOWERS 


A tree’s leaves may be ever so good, 

So may its bark, so may its wood. 

But unless you put the right thing to its root 
It never will show much flower or fruit. 

But I may be one who does not care 
Ever to have tree bloom or bear. 

Leaves for smooth and bark for rough, 
Leaves and bark may be tree enough. 

Some giant trees have bloom so small 
They might as well have none at all. 

Late in life I have come on fern 
Now lichens are due to have their turn. 

I bade men tell me which in brief. 

Which is fairer, flower or leaf. 

They did not have the wit to say, 

Leaves by night and flowers by day. 

Leaves and bark, leaves and bark, 

To lean against and hear in the dark. 

Petals I may have once pursued. 

Leaves are all my darker mood. 


[ 387 ] 



A LEAF TREADER 


I have been treading on leaves all day until I am autumn 
tired. 

God knows all the color and form of leaves I have trodden 
on and mired. 

Perhaps I have put forth too much strength and been too 
fierce from fear. 

I have safely trodden underfoot the leaves of another year. 

All summer long they were overhead, more lifted up than I. 

To come to their final place in earth they had to pass me by. 

All summer long I thought I heard them threatening under 
their breath. 

And when they came it seemed with a will to carry me with 
them to death. 

They spoke to the fugitive in my heart as if it were leaf to 
leaf. 

They tapped at my eyelids and touched my lips with an in- 
vitation to gnef. 

But it was no reason I had to go because they had to go. 

Now up my knee to keep on top of another year of snow. 


[ 388 ] 



ON TAKING FROM THE TOP TO BROADEN 
THE BASE 


Roll stones down on our head! 
You squat old pyramid. 

Your last good avalanche 
Was long since slid 

Your top has sunk too low. 

Your base has spread too wide. 
For you to roll one stone 
Down if you tried. 

But even at the word 
A pebble hit the roof. 

Another shot through glass 
Demanding proof. 

Before their panic hands 
Were fighting for the latch. 

The mud came in one cold 
Unleavened batch. 

And none was left to prate 
Of an old mountain’s case 
That still took from its top 
To broaden its base. 


[ 389 ] 



THEY WERE WELCOME TO THEIR BELIEF 


Grief may have thought it was gnef 
Care may have thought it was care 
They were welcome to their belief, 
The ovenmportant pair. 

No, it took all the snows that clung 
To the low roof over his bed. 
Beginning when he was young, 

To induce the one snow on his head. 

But whenever the roof came white 
The head in the dark below 
Was a shade less the color of night 
A shade more the color of snow 

Grief may have thought it was grief. 
Care may have thought it was care. 
But neither one was the thief 
Of his raven color of hair. 


[ 390 ] 



THE STRONG ARE SAYING NOTHING 


The soil now gets a lumphng soft and damp, 

And small regard to the future of any weed. 

The final flat of the hoe’s approval stamp 
Is reserved for the bed of a few selected seed. 

There is seldom more than a man to a harrowed piece 
Men work alone, their lots plowed far apart. 

One stringing a chain of seed in an open crease, 

And another stumbling after a halting cart. 

To the fresh and black of the squares of early mold 
The leafless bloom of a plum is fresh and white, 
Though there’s more than a doubt if the weather is not 
too cold 

For the bees to come and serve its beauty aright 

Wmd goes from farm to farm in wave on wave. 

But carries no cry of what is hoped to be. 

There may be little or much beyond the grave. 

But the strong are saying nothing until they see. 


[ 391 ] 



THE MASTER SPEED 


No speed of wind or water rushing by 

But you have speed far greater You can climb 

Back up a stream of radiance to the sky, 

And back through history up the stream of time. 
And you were given this swiftness, not for haste 
Nor chiefly that you may go where you will. 

But in the rush of everything to waste, 

That you may have the power of standing still — 
Off any still or moving thing you say. 

Two such as you with such a master speed 
Cannot be parted nor be swept away 
From one another once you are agreed 
That life is only life forevermore 
Together wing to wing and oar to oar. 


[ 392 ] 



MOON COMPASSES 


I stole forth dimly in the dripping pause 
Between two downpours to see what there was. 
And a masked moon had spread down compass rays 
To a cone mountain in the midnight haze, 

As if the final estimate were hers, 

And as it measured in her calipers. 

The mountain stood exalted in its place. 

So love will take between the hands a face. . . . 



NEITHER OUT FAR NOR IN DEEP 


The people along the sand 
All turn and look one way. 

They turn their back on the land. 
They look at the sea all day. 

As long as it takes to pass 
A ship keeps raising its hull, 

The wetter ground like glass 
Reflects a standing gull. 

The land may vary more, 

But wherever the truth may be— 
The water comes ashore. 

And the people look at the sea. 

They cannot look out far. 

They cannot look in deep. 

But when was that ever a bar 
To any watch they keep? 


[ 394 ] 



VOICE WAYS 


Some things are never clear 
But the weather is clear tonight. 
Thanks to a clearmg rain. 

The mountains are brought up near, 
The stars are brought out bright. 
Your old sweet-cynical strain 
Would come in like you here 
‘So we won’t say nothing is clear. 5 


[ 395 ] 



DESIGN 


I found a dimpled spider, fat and white. 

On a white heal-all, holding up a moth 
Like a white piece of rigid satin cloth— 

Assorted characters of death and blight 
Mixed ready to begin the morning right. 

Like the ingredients of a witches’ broth— 

A snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth. 

And dead wings carried like a paper kite. 

What had that flower to do with being white, 
The wayside blue and innocent heal-all? 

What brought the kindred spider to that height, 
Then steered the white moth thither m the night? 
What but design of darkness to appall?— 

If design govern in a thing so small. 


[ 396 ] 



ON A BIRD SINGING IN ITS SLEEP 


A bird half wakened m the lunar noon 
Sang halfway through its httle inborn tune. 
Partly because it sang but once all night 
And that from no especial bush’s height; 
Partly because it sang vencriloquist 
And had the inspiration to desist 
Almost before the prick of hostile ears. 

It ventured less in peril than appears. 

It could not have come down to us so far 
Through the interstices of things ajar 
On the long bead chain of repeated birth 
To be a bird while we are men on earth 
If singing out of sleep and dream that way 
Had made it much more easily a prey. 


[ 397 ] 



AFTERFLAKES 


In the thick of a teeming snowfall 
I saw my shadow on snow. 

I turned and looked back up at the sky. 
Where we still look to ask the why 
Of everything below. 

If I shed such a darkness. 

If the reason was in me. 

That shadow of mme should show m form 
Against the shapeless shadow of storm, 
How swarthy I must be. 

I turned and looked back upward. 

The whole sky was blue; 

And the thick flakes floating at a pause 
Were but frost knots on an airy gauze, 
With the sun shining through. 


[ 398 ] 



CLEAR AND COLDER 


Wind the season-climate mixer 
In my Witches’ Weather Primer 
Says to make this Fall Elixir 
First you let the summer simmer. 
Using neither spoon nor skimmer. 

Till about the right consistence. 

(This like fate by stars is reckoned, 
None remaining in existence 
Under magnitude the second), 

Then take some left-over winter 
Far to north of the St. Lawrence 
Leaves to strip and branches splinter, 
Bring on wind. Bring rain in torrents— 
Colder than the season warrants. 

Dash it with some snow for powder. 

If this seems like witchcraft rather, 

If this seems a witches’ chowder 
(All my eye and Cotton Mather!), 

Wait and watch the liquor settle. 

I could stand whole dayfuls of it. 
Wind she brews a heady kettle. 
Human beings love it— love it. 

Gods above are not above it. 


[ 399 ] 



UNHARVESTED 


A scent of ripeness from over a wall. 

And come to leave the routine road 
And look for what had made me stall. 

There sure enough was an apple tree 
That had eased itself of its summer load. 

And of all but its trivial foliage free, 

Now breathed as light as a lady’s fan. 

For there there had been an apple fall 
As complete as the apple had given man 
The ground was one circle of solid red. 

May something go always unharvested! 

May much stay out of our stated plan. 

Apples or something forgotten and left, 

So smelling their sweetness would be no theft. 


[ 400 ] 



THERE ARE ROUGHLY ZONES 


We sit indoors and talk of the cold outside. 

And every gust that gathers strength and heaves 

Is a threat to the house. But the house has long been tried. 

We think of the tree. If it never again has leaves, 

We’ll know, we say, that this was the night it died. 

It is very far north, we admit, to have brought the peach. 
What comes over a man, is it soul or mind— 

That to no limits and bounds he can stay confined? 

You would say his ambition was to extend the reach 
Clear to the Arctic of every living land. 

Why is his nature forever so hard to teach 

That though there is no fixed line between wrong and right, 

There are roughly zones whose laws must be obeyed. 

There is nothing much we can do for the tree tomght. 

But we can’t help feeling more than a little betrayed 
That the northwest wind should rise to such a height 
Just when the cold went down so many below 
The tree has no leaves and may never have them again. 

We must wait till some months hence in the spring to know. 
But if it is destined never again to grow, 

It can blame this limitless trait in the hearts of men.

A TRIAL RUN 


I said to myself almost in prayer. 

It will start hair-raising currents of air 
When you give it the livid metal-sap. 

It will make a homicidal roar. 

It will shake its cast stone reef of floor. 

It will gather speed till your nerves prepare 
To hear it wreck in a thunder-clap. 

But stand your ground 
As they say in war. 

It is cotter-pinned, it is bedded true. 
Everything its parts can do 
Has been thought out and accounted for. 
Your least touch sets it going round. 

And when to stop it rests with you. 


[ 402 ] 



NOT QUITE SOCIAL 


Some of you will be glad I did what I did. 

And the rest won’t want to punish me too severely 
For finding a thing to do that though not forbid 
Yet wasn’t enjoined and wasn’t expected clearly. 

To punish me overcruelly wouldn’t be right 
For merely giving you once more gentle proof 
That the city’s hold on a man is no more tight 
Than when its walls rose higher than any roof. 

You may taunt me with not bemg able to flee the earth. 
You have me there, but loosely as I would be held. 

The way of understanding is partly mirth 
I would not be taken as ever having rebelled. 

And anyone is free to condemn me to death— 

If he leaves it to nature to carry out the sentence. 

I shall will to the common stock of air my breath 
And pay a death-tax of fairly polite repentance. 


[ 403 ] 



PROVIDE, PROVIDE 


The witch that came (the withered hag) 

To wash the steps with pail and rag. 

Was once the beauty Abishag, 

The picture pride of Hollywood. 

Too many fall from great and good 
For you to doubt the likelihood. 

Die early and avoid the fate. 

Or if predestined to die late, 

Make up your mind to die in state. 

Make the whole stock exchange your own! 
If need be occupy a throne. 

Where nobody can call you crone. 

Some have relied on what they knew; 

Others on being simply true. 

What worked for them might work for you. 

No memory of having starred 
Atones for later disregard, 

Or keeps the end from being hard. 

Better to go down dignified 

With boughten friendship at your side 

Than none at all. Provide, provide!

TEN MILLS 




TEN MILLS 


PRECAUTION 

I never dared be radical when young 

For fear it would make me conservative when old. 

THE SPAN OE LIFE 

The old dog barks backward without getting up. 

I can remember when he was a pup 

the weights’ biplane 

This biplane is the shape of human flight. 

Its name might better be First Motor Kite. 

Its makers’ name— Time cannot get that wrong, 
For it was writ in heaven doubly Wright. 

evil tendencies cancel 

Will the blight end the chestnut? 

The farmers rather guess not. 

It keeps smoldering at the roots 
And sending up new shoots 
Till another parasite 
Shall come to end the blight. 

pertinax 

Let chaos storml 

Let cloud shapes swarm! 

I wait for form. 


[ 407 ] 



WASPISH 


On glossy wires artistically bent, 

He draws himself up to his full extent. 
His natty wings with self-assurance perk. 
His stinging quarters menacingly work. 
Poor egotist, he has no way of knowing 
But he’s as good as anybody going. 

ONE GUESS 

He has dust m his eyes and a fan for a wing, 

A leg akimbo with which he can sing, 

And a mouthful of dye stuff instead of a sting. 

THE HARDSHIP OF ACCOUNTING 

Never ask of money spent 
Where the spender thinks it went. 
Nobody was ever meant 
To remember or invent 
What he did with every cent. 

NOT ALL THERE 

I turned to speak to God 
About the world’s despair; 

But to make bad matters worse 
I found God wasn’t there. 

God turned to speak to me 
(Don’t anybody laugh) 

God found I wasn’t there— 

At least not over half. 


[ 408 ] 



IN DIVES’ DIVE 


It is late at night and still I am losing, 
But still I am steady and unaccusmg. 

As long as the Declaration guards 
My right to be equal in number of cards. 

It is nothing to me who runs the Dive. 
Let’s have a look at another five. 


[ 409 ] 




THE OUTLANDS 




THE VINDICTIVES 


You like to hear about gold 
A king filled his prison room 
As full as the room could hold 
To the top of his reach on the wall 
With every known shape of the stuff. 

’Twas to buy himself off his doom. 

But it wasn’t ransom enough. 

His captors accepted it all, 

But didn’t let go of the king. 

They made him send out a call 
To his subjects to gather them more. 

And his subjects wrung all they could wring 
Out of temple and palace and store 
But when there seemed no more to bring, 

His captors convicted the king 
Of once having started a war, 

And strangled the wretch with a string. 

But really that gold was not half 

That a king might have hoped to compel— 

Not a half, not a third, not a tithe. 

The long had scarce ceased to writhe, 

When hate gave a terrible laugh. 

Like a manhole opened to Hell. 

If gold pleased the conqueror, well, 

That gold should be the one thing 
The conqueror henceforth should lack. 

They gave no more thought to the king. 

All joined in the game of hide-gold. 

They swore all the gold should go back 
Deep into the earth whence it came. 

[ 413 ] 



Their minds ran on cranny and crack. 
All joined in the maddening game. 
The tale is still boastmgly told 
Of many a treasuie by name 
That vanished into the black 
And put out its light for the foe. 

That self-sack and self-overthrow. 

That was the splendidest sack 
Since the forest Germans sacked Rome 
And took the gold candlesticks home. 

One Inca prince on the rack, 

And late in his last hour alive. 

Told them in what lake to dive 
To seek what they seemed so to want. 
They dived and nothmg was found 
He told them to dive till they drowned. 
The whole fierce conquering pack 
Hunted and tortured and raged. 

There were suns of story and vaunt 
They searched for into Brazil 
Their tongues hanging out unassuaged 

But the conquered grew meek and still. 
They slowly and silently aged. 

They kept them secrets and died. 
Maliciously satisfied. 

One knew of a burial hole 
In the floor of a tribal cave. 

Where under deep ash and charcoal 
And cracked bones, human and beast. 
The midden of feast upon feast, 

[ 414 ] 



Was coiled m its last resting grave 
The great tieasure wanted the most, 
The great thousand-linked gold chain. 
Each hnk of a hundredweight, 

That once between post and post 
(In-leaning under the strain). 

And looped ten tunes back and forth. 
Had served as a palace gate. 

Some said it had gone to the coast. 
Some over the mountains east. 

Some into the country north. 

On the backs of a single-file host. 
Commanded by one sun-priest. 

And raising a dust with a tram 
Of flashing links in the sun. 

No matter what some may say. 

(The saying is never done ) 

There bright in the filth it lay 
Untarnished by rust and decay. 

And be all plunderers curst. 

‘The best way to hate is the worst. 

’Tis to find what the hated need. 

Never mind of what actual worth. 

And wipe that out of the earth. 

Let them die of unsatisfied greed, 

Of unsatisfied love of display. 

Of unsatisfied love of the high, 
Unvulgar, unsoiled, and ideal. 

Let their trappings be taken away. 

Let them suffer starvation and die 
Of being brought down to the real.’ 


[ 415 ] 



THE BEARER OF EVIL TIDINGS 


The bearer of evil tidings, 

When he was halfway there, 

Remembered that evil tidings 
Were a dangerous thing to bear. 

So when he came to the parting 
Where one road led to the throne 
And one went off to the mountains 
And into the wild unknown, 

He took the one to the mountains. 

He ran through the Vale of Cashmere, 

He ran through the rhododendrons 
Till he came to the land of Pamir. 

And there in a precipice valley 
A girl of his age he met 
Took him home to her bower. 

Or he might be running yet. 

She taught him her tribe’s religion: 

How ages and ages smee 
A princess en route from China 
To marry a Persian prince 

Had been found with child; and her army 
Had come to a troubled halt. 

And though a god was the father 
And nobody else at fault. 

It had seemed discreet to remain there 
And neither go on nor back. 

So they stayed and declared a village 
There in the land of the Yak. 

[ 416 ] 



And the child that came of the princess 
Estabhshed a royal line, 

And his mandates were given heed to 
Because he was bom divme 

And that was why there were people 
On one Himalayan shelf; 

And the bearer of evil tidings 
Decided to stay there himself. 

At least he had this in common 
With the race he chose to adopt: 

They had both of them had their reasons 
For stopping where they had stopped. 

As for his evil tidings, 

Belshazzar s overthrow, 

Why hurry to tell Belshazzar 
What soon enough he would know? 


[ 417 ] 



IRIS BY NIGHT 


One misty evening, one another’s guide. 

We two were groping down a Malvern side 
The last wet fields and dripping hedges home. 
There came a moment of confusmg lights. 

Such as according to belief in Rome 
Were seen of old at Memphis on the heights 
Before the fragments of a former sun 
Could concentrate anew and rise as one. 

Light was a paste of pigment in our eyes 
And then there was a moon and then a scene 
So watery as to seem submarine, 

In which we two stood saturated, drownea. 

The clover-mingled rowan on the ground 
Had taken all the water it could as dew. 

And still the air was saturated too. 

Its airy pressure turned to water weight. 

Then a small rambow hke a trellis gate, 

A very small moon-made prismatic bow, 

Stood closely over us through which to go. 

And then we were vouchsafed the miracle 
That never yet to other two befell 
And I alone of us have lived to tell 
A wonder! Bow and rainbow as it bent, 

Instead of moving with us as we went, 

(To keep the pots of gold from being found) 

It lifted from its dewy pediment 

Its two mote-swimming many-colored ends. 

And gathered them together in a ring. 

And we stood in it softly circled round 
From all division time or foe can bring 
In a relation of elected friends.

BUILD SOIL 




BUILD SOIL— A POLITICAL PASTORAL 


Why, Tityrus! But you've forgotten me. 

I’m Meliboeus the potato man. 

The one you had the talk with, you remember, 
Here on this very campus years ago. 

Hard times have struck me and I’m on the move. 
I’ve had to give my interval farm up 
For interest, and I’ve bought a mountain farm 
For nothing down, all-out-doors of a place. 

All woods and pasture only fit for sheep. 

But sheep is what I’m going mto next. 

I’m done forever with potato crops 
At thirty cents a bushel. Give me sheep. 

I know wool’s down to seven cents a pound. 

But I don’t calculate to sell my wool. 

I didn’t my potatoes. I consumed them. 

I'll dress up in sheep’s clothing and eat sheep. 
The Muse takes care of you You live by writing 
Your poems on a farm and call that farming. 

Oh, I don’t blame you. I say take life easy. 

I should myself, only I don’t know how. 

But have some pity on us who have to work. 
Why don’t you use your talents as a writer 
To advertise our farms to city buyers, 

Or else write something to improve food prices. 
Get in a poem toward the next election. 

Oh, Meliboeus, I have half a mind 
To take a writing hand in politics. 

Before now poetry has taken notice 
Of wars, and what are wars but politics 
Transformed from chronic to acute and bloody? 
[ 421 ] 



I may be wrong, but, Tityrus, to me 
The times seem revolutionary bad. 

The question is whether they’ve reached a depth 
Of desperation that would warrant poetry’s 
Leaving love’s alternations, joy and grief. 

The weather’s alternations, summer and winter, 
Our age-long theme, for the uncertainty 
Of judging who is a contemporary liar— 

Who in particular, when all alike 

Get called as much in clashes of ambition. 

Life may be tragically bad, and I 
Make bold to sing it so, but do I dare 
Name names and tell you who by name is wicked? 
Whittier’s luck with Skipper Ireson awes me. 
Many men’s luck with Greatest Washington 
(Who sat for Stuart’s portrait, but who sat 
Equally for the nation’s Constitution). 

I prefer to smg safely in the realm 
Of types, composite and imagined people: 

To affirm there is such a thing as evil 
Personified, but ask to be excused 
From saying on a jury ‘Here’s the guilty.’ 

I doubt if you’re convinced the times are bad. 

I keep my eye on Congress, Meliboeus. 

They’re in the best position of us all 
To know if anything is very wrong 
I mean they could be trusted to give the alarm 
If earth were thought about to change its axis. 

Or a star coming to dilate the sun. 

As long as lightly all their live-long sessions, 

Like a yard full of school boys out at recess 

[ 422 ] 



Before their plays and games were organized. 

They yelling mix tag, hide-and-seek, hop-scotch, 

And leap frog in each other’s wav,— all’s v ell 
Let newspapers profess to fear the worst! 

Nothing’s portentous, I am reassured 

Is socialism needed, do you think? 

We have it now. For socialism is 
An element in any government. 

There’s no such thing as socialism pure— 

Except as an abstraction of the mmd. 

There’s only democratic socialism 
Monarchic socialism— oligarchic. 

The last bemg what they seem to have in Russia. 
You often get it most in monarchy. 

Least in democracy. In practice, pure, 

I don’t know what it would be No one knows 
I have no doubt like all the loves when 
Philosophized together mto one— 

One sickness of the body and the soul. 

Thank God our practice holds the loves apart 
Beyond embarrassing self-consciousness 
Where natural friends are met, where dogs are kept. 
Where women pray with priests. There is no love. 
There’s only love of men and women, love 
Of children, love of fnends, of men, of God, 

Divine love, human love, parental love, 

Roughly discriminated for the rough. 

Poetry, itself once more, is back in love. 

Pardon the analogy, my Meliboeus, 

For sweeping me away. Let’s see, where was I? 

[ 423 ] 



But don’t you think more should be socialized 
Than is? 


What should you mean by socialized? 

Made good for everyone— things like inventions— 
Made so we all should get the good of them— 

All, not just great exploiting businesses. 

We sometimes only get the bad of them. 

In your sense of the word ambition has 

Been socialized— the first propensity 

To be attempted. Greed may well come next. 

But the worst one of all to leave uncurbed, 
Unsoeialized, is ingenuity: 

Which for no sordid self-aggrandizement, 

For nothing but its own blind satisfaction 
(In this it is as much like hate as love) 

Works in the dark as much against as for us. 

Even while we talk some chemist at Columbia 
Is stealthily contriving wool from jute 
That when let loose upon the grazing world 
Will put ten thousand farmers out of sheep. 
Everyone asks for freedom for himself, 

The man free love, the business man free trade, 

The writer and talker free speech and free press. 
Political ambition has been taught, 

By being punished back, it is not free: 

It must at some point gracefully refrain. 

Greed has been taught a little abnegation 
And shall be more before we’re done with it. 

It is just fool enough to think itself 

Self-taught. But our brute snarling and lashing taught it. 

None shall be as ambitious as he can. 

[ 424 ] 



None should be as ingenious as he could, 

Not if I had my say. Bounds should be set 

To ingenuity for being so cruel 

In bringing change unheralded on the unready. 

I elect you to put the curb on it. 

Were I dictator, I’ll tell you what I’d do. 

What should you do? 


I’d let things take their course 
And then I’d claim the credit for the outcome. 

You’d make a sort of safety-first dictator. 

Don’t let the things I say against myself 
Betray you into taking sides against me, 

Or it might get you into trouble with me. 

I’m not afraid to prophesy the future, 

And be judged by the outcome, Meliboeus. 

Listen and I will take my dearest risk. 

We’re always too much out or too much in. 

At present from a cosmical dilation 

We’re so much out that the odds are against 

Our ever getting inside in again. 

But inside in is where we’ve got to get. 

My friends all know I’m interpersonal. 

But long before I’m interpersonal 
Away ’way down inside I’m personal. 

Just so before we’re international 
Were national and act as nationals. 

The colors are kept unmixed on the palette, 

Or better on dish plates all around the room, 

[ 425 ] 


So the effect when they are mixed on canvas 
May seem almost exclusively designed 
Some minds are so confounded intermental 
They remind me of pictuies on a palette: 

‘Look at what happened Surely some God pinxit. 
Come look at my significant mud pie.’ 

It’s hard to tell which is the worse abhorrence 
Whether it’s persons pied or nations pied. 

Don’t let me seem to say the exchange, the encounter. 
May not be the important thing at last. 

It well may be We meet— I don’t say when— 

But must bring to the meeting the maturest, 

The longest-saved-up, raciest, localest 
We have strength of reserve in us to bring. 

Tityrus, sometimes I’m perplexed myself 
To find the good of commerce. Why should I 
Have to sell you my apples and buy yours? 

It can’t be just to give the robber a cl mce 
To catch them and take toll of them m transit. 

Too mean a thought to get much comfort out of. 

I figure that like any bandying 
Of words or toys, it ministers to health. 

It very likely quickens and refines us. 

To market ’tis our destiny to go. 

But much as in the end we bring for sale there 
There is still more we never bring or should bring; 
More that should be kept back— the soil for instance 
In my opinion,— though we both know poets 
Who fall all over each other to bring soil 
And even subsoil and hardpan to market. 

To sell the hay off, let alone the soil, 

[ 426 ] 



Is an unpardonable sin in farming 
The moral is, make a late stait to maiket 
Let me preach to you, will you, Meliboeus? 

Preach on. I thought you were already preaching. 
But preach and see if I can tell the difference. 

Needless to say to you, my argument 
Is not to lure the city to the country. 

Let those possess the land and only those. 

Who love it with a love so strong and stupid 
That they may be abused and taken advantage of 
And made fun of by busmess, law, and art, 

They still hang on. That so much of the earth’s 
Unoccupied need not make us uneasy. 

We don’t pretend to complete occupancy. 

The world’s one globe, human society 
Another softer globe that slightly flattened 
Rests on the world, and clinging slowly rolls. 

We have our own round shape to keep unbroken. 
The world’s size has no more to do with us 
Than has the universe’s. We are balls. 

We are round from the same source of roundness. 
We are both round because the mind is round, 
Because all reasoning is in a circle. 

At least that’s why the universe is round 

If what you’re preaching is a line of conduct, 

Just what am I supposed to do about it? 

Reason in circles? 


No, refuse to be 

Seduced back to the land by any claim 
The land may seem to have on man to use it. 

[ 427 ] 



Let none assume to till the land but farmers. 

I only speak to you as one of them. 

You shall go to your run-out mountain farm, 

Poor castaway of commerce, and so live 
That none shall ever see you come to market- 
Not for a long long time. Plant, breed, produce, 

But what you raise or grow, why feed it out. 

Eat it or plow it under where it stands 
To build the soil. For what is more accursed 
Than an impoverished soil pale and metallic? 

What cries more to our kind for sympathy? 

I’ll make a compact with you, Meliboeus, 

To match you deed for deed and plan for plan. 
Friends crowd around me with their five-year plans 
That Soviet Russia has made fashionable. 

You come to me and 111 unfold to you 
A five-year plan I call so, not because 
It takes ten years or so to carry out, 

Rather because it took five years at least 
To think it out. Come close, let us conspire— 

In self-restraint, if in restraint of trade. 

You will go to your run-out mountain farm 
And do what I command you. I take care 
To command only what you meant to do 
Anyway. That is my style of dictator. 

Build soil. Turn the farm in upon itself 
Until it can contain itself no more. 

But sweating-full, drips wine and oil a little. 

I will go to my run-out social mind 
And be as unsocial with it as I can. 

The thought I have, and my first impulse is 
To take to market~I will turn it under. 

The thought from that thought-I will turn it under 

[428] 



And so on to the limit of my nature 
We are too much out, and if we won’t draw in 
We shall be driven m I was brought up 
A state-rights free-trade Democrat. What’s that? 
An inconsistency. The state shall be 
Laws to itself, it seems, and yet have no 
Control of what it sells or what it buys. 

Suppose someone comes near me who in rate 
Of speech and thinking is so much my better 
I am imposed on, silenced and discouraged. 

Do I submit to being supplied by him 
As the more economical producer, 

More wonderful, more beautiful producer? 

No. I unostentatiously move off 
Far enough for my thought-flow to resume. 
Thought product and food product are to me 
Nothing compared to the producing of them. 

I sent you once a song with the refrain: 

Let me be the one 
To do what is done— 

My share at least lest I be empty-idle. 

Keep off each other and keep each other off. 
You see the beauty of my proposal is 
It needn’t wait on general revolution. 

I bid you to a one-man revolution— 

The only revolution that is coming. 

Were too unseparate out among each other— 
With goods to sell and notions to impart. 

A youngster comes to me with half a quatrain 
To ask me if I think it worth the pains 
Of working out the rest, the other half. 

I am brought guaranteed young prattle poems 

[ 429 ] 



Made publicly m school, above suspicion 
Of plagiarism and help of cheating parents. 

We congregate embracing from distrust 
As much as love, and too close in to strike 
And be so very striking. Steal away 
The song says. Steal away and stay away. 

Don’t join too many gangs. Join few if any. 

Join the United States and join the family— 

But not much in between unless a college. 

Is it a bargain, Shepherd Mehboeus? 

Probably, but you’re far too fast and strong 
For my mind to keep working in your presence 
I can tell better after I get home. 

Better a month from now when cutting posts 
Or mending fence it all comes back to me 
What I was thinking when you interrupted 
My life-train logic. I agree with you 
Were too unseparate. And going home 
From company means coming to our senses. 


[430 J 



TO A THINKER 


The last step taken found your heft 
Decidedly upon the left. 

One more would throw you on the light. 
Another still— you see your plight 
You call this thinking, but it’s walking. 
Not even that, it’s only rocking, 

Or weaving like a stabled horse- 
From force to matter and back to force. 
From form to content and back to form, 
From norm to crazy and hack to norm, 
From bound to free and back to bound, 
From sound to sense and back to sound 
So back and forth. It almost scares 
A man the way things come in pairs. 

Just now you’re off democracy 
(With a polite regret to be), 

And leaning on dictatorship; 

But if you will accept the tip. 

In less than no time, tongue and pen. 
You’ll be a democrat again. 

A reasoner and good as such. 

Don’t let it bother you too much 
If it makes you look helpless please 
And a temptation to the tease. 

Suppose you’ve no direction in you, 

I don’t see but you must continue 
To use the gift you do possess, 

And sway with reason more or less. 

I own I never really warmed 
To the reformer or reformed. 


[ 431 ] 



And yet conversion has its place 
Not halfway down the scale of grace. 
So if you find you must repent 
From side to side in argument. 

At least don’t use your mind too hard, 
But trust my instinct— I’m a bard. 


[ 432 ] 



AFTERTHOUGHT 




A MISSIVE MISSILE 


Someone in ancient Mas d’Azil 
Once took a little pebble wheel 
And dotted it with red for me. 

And sent it to me years and years— 
A million years to be precise— 
Across the barrier of ice: 

Two round dots and a ripple streak. 
So vivid as to seem to speak. 

But what imperfectly appears 
Is whether the two dots were tears. 
Two teardrops, one for either eye, 
And the wave line a shaken sigh. 

But no, the color used is red 
Not tears but drops of blood instead. 
The line must be a jagged blade. 

The sender must have had to die. 
And wanted someone now to know 
His death was sacrificial-votive 
So almost clear and yet obscure. 

If only anyone were sure 
A motive then was still a motive. 

O you who bring this to my hand. 
You are no common messenger 
(Your badge of office is a spade). 

It grieves me to have had you stand 
So long for nothing. No reply— 

There is no answer, I’m afraid. 
Across the icy barrier 
For my obscure petitioner. 

Suppose his ghost is standing by 
Importunate to give the hint 
[ 435 ] 



And be successfully conveyed. 

How anyone can fail to see 
Where perfectly in form and tint 
The metaphor, the symbol lies! 

Why will I not analogize? 

(I do too much in some men’s eyes.) 

Oh, slow uncomprehending me. 

Enough to make a spirit moan 
Or rustle in a bush or tree. 

I have the ocher-written flint. 

The two dots and the ripple line. 

The meaning of it is unknown. 

Or else I fear entirely mine, 

All modem, nothing ancient in t. 
Unsatisfying to us each. 

Far as we aim our signs to reach. 

Far as we often make them reach, 

Across the soul-from-soul abyss, 

There is an aeon-limit set 

Beyond which they are doomed to miss. 

Two souls may be too widely met. 

That sad-with-distance river beach 
With mortal longing may beseech; 

It cannot speak as far as this. 



A 

WITNESS 

TREE 




BEECH 


Where my imaginary line 
Bends square in woods, an iron spme 
And pile of real rocks have been founded. 
And off this comer in the wild. 

Where these are driven in and piled. 

One tree, by bemg deeply wounded. 

Has been impressed as Witness Tree 
And made commit to memory 
My proof of bemg not unbounded. 

Thus truth’s established and borne out.

Though by a world of doubt surrounded

ONE OR TWO 




THE SILKEN TENT 


She is as in a field a silken tent 
At midday when a sunny summer breeze 
Has dried the dew and all its ropes relent. 

So that m guys it gently sways at ease, 

And its supporting central cedar pole, 

That is its pinnacle to heavenward 
And signifies the sureness of the soul, 

Seems to owe naught to any single cord, 

But strictly held by none, is loosely bound 
By countless silken ties of love and thought 
To everything on earth the compass round, 
And only by one's going slightly taut 
In the capriciousness of summer air 
Is of the slightest bondage made aware. 


[ 443 ] 



ALL REVELATION 


A head thrusts in as for the view, 

But where it is it thrusts in from 
Or what it is it thrusts into 
By that Cyb’laean avenue, 

And what can of its coming come, 

And whither it will be withdrawn, 

And what take hence or leave behind, 
These things the mind has pondered on 
A moment and still asking gone. 

Strange apparition of the mind! 

But the impervious geode 
Was entered, and its inner crust 
Of crystals with a ray cathode 
At every point and facet glowed 
In answer to the mental thrust. 

Eyes seeking the response of eyes 
Bring out the stars, bring out the flowers, 
Thus concentrating earth and skies 
So none need be afraid of size. 

All revelation has been ours. 


[ 444 ] 



HAPPINESS MAKES UP IN HEIGHT 
FOE WHAT IT LACKS IN LENGTH 


Oh, stormy stormy world, 

The days you were not swirled 
Around with mist and cloud. 

Or wrapped as in a shroud. 
And the sun’s brilliant ball 
Was not in part or all 
Obscured from mortal view— 
Were days so very few 
I can but wonder whence 
I get the lasting sense 
Of so much warmth and light. 
If my mistrust is right 
It may be altogether 
From one day’s perfect weather. 
When starting clear at dawn. 
The day swept clearly on 
To finish clear at eve. 

I verily believe 
My fair impression may 
Be all from that one day 
No shadow crossed but ours 
As through its blazing flowers 
We went from house to wood 
For change of solitude. 


[ 445 ] 



COME IN 


As I came to the edge of the woods. 

Thrush music— harkl 

Now if it was dusk outside. 

Inside it was dark. 

Too dark in the woods for a bird 
By sleight of wing 
To better its perch for the night. 
Though it still could sing. 

The last of the light of the sun 
That had died in the west 
Still lived for one song more 
In a thrush’s breast. 

Far in the pillared dark 
Thrush music went— 

Almost like a call to come in 
To the dark and lament. 

But no, I was out for stars: 

I would not come in. 

I meant not even if asked. 

And I hadn’t been. 


[ 446 ] 



I COULD GIVE ALL TO TIME 


To Time it never seems that he is brave 
To set himself against the peaks of snow 
To lay them level with the running wave. 

Nor is he overjoyed when they lie low, 

But only grave, contemplative and grave. 

What now is inland shall be ocean isle, 

Then eddies playing round a sunken reef 
Like the curl at the comer of a smile, 

And I could share Time’s lack of joy or grief 
At such a planetary change of style. 

I could give all to Time except— except 
What I myself have held. But why declare 
The things forbidden that while the Customs slept 
I have crossed to Safety with? For I am There, 
And what I would not part with I have kept 



CARPE DIEM 


Age saw two quiet children 
Go loving by at twilight. 

He knew not whether homeward, 

Or outward from the village, 

Or (chimes were ringing) churchward. 
He waited (they were strangers) 

Till they were out of hearing 
To bid them both be happy. 

‘Be happy, happy, happy. 

And seize the day of pleasure. 

The age-long theme is Age’s. 

’Twas Age imposed on poems 
Their gather-roses burden 
To warn against the danger 
That overtaken lovers 
From being overflooded 
With happiness should have it 
And yet not know they have it. 

But bid life seize the present? 

It lives less in the present 
Than in the future always, 

And less in both together 
Than in the past. The present 
Is too much for the senses, 

Too crowding, too confusing— 

Too present to imagine. 


[ 448 ] 



THE WIND AND THE RAIN 


i 

That far-off day the leaves m flight 
Were letting in the colder light 
A season-ending wind there blew 
That as it did the forest strew 
I leaned on with a singing trust 
And let it drive me deathward too. 

With breaking step I stabbed the dust. 

Yet did not much to shorten stride 
I sang of death— but had I known 
The many deaths one must have died 
Before he came to meet his own! 

Oh, should a child be left unwarned 
That any song in which he mourned 
Would be as if he prophesied? 

It were unworthy of the tongue 
To let the half of life alone 
And play the good without the ill 
And yet ’twould seem that what is sung 
In happy sadness by the young 
Fate has no choice but to fulfill. 

ii 

Flowers in the desert heat 
Contrive to bloom 

On melted mountain water led by flume 
To wet their feet. 

But something in it still is incomplete. 
Before I thought the wilted to exalt 
With water I would see them water-bowed. 


[ 449 ] 



I would pick up all ocean less its salt, 

And though it were as much as cloud could bear 
Would load it on to cloud. 

And rolling it inland on roller air. 

Would empty it unsparing on the flower 
That past its prime lost petals in the flood, 

(Who cares but for the future of the bud?) 

And all the more the mightier the shower 
Would run in under it to get my share. 

Tis not enough on roots and in the mouth, 

But give me water heavy on the head 
In all the passion of a broken drouth. 

And there is always more than should be said. 

As strong is rain without as wine within. 

As magical as sunlight on the skin. 

I have been one no dwelling could contain 
When there was rain; 

But I must forth at dusk, my time of day, 

To see to the unburdening of skies 
Rain was the tears adopted by my eyes 
That have none left to stay. 


[ 450 ] 



THE MOST OF IT 


He thought he kept the universe alone; 

For all the voice in answer he could wake 
Was but the mocking echo of his own 
From some tree-hidden cliff across the lake 
Some morning from the boulder-broken beach 
He would cry out on life, that what it wants 
Is not its own love back in copy speech. 

But counter-love, original response. 

And nothing ever came of what he cried 
Unless it was the embodiment that crashed 
In the cliff’s talus on the other side. 

And then in the far distant water splashed 
But after a time allowed for it to swim. 

Instead of proving human when it neared 
And someone else additional to him, 

As a great buck it powerfully appeared, 

Pushing the crumpled water up ahead, 

And landed pouring like a waterfall, 

And stumbled through the rocks with homy tread, 
And forced the underbrush— and that was all. 


[ 451 ] 



NEVER AGAIN WOULD BIRDS’ SONG 
BE THE SAME 


He would declare and could himself believe 
That the birds there in all the gaiden round 
From having heard the daylong voice of Eve 
Had added to their own an oversound, 

Her tone of meaning but without the words. 
Admittedly an eloquence so soft 
Could only have had an influence on birds 
When call or laughter carried it aloft. 

Be that as may be, she was in their song. 
Moreover her voice upon their voices crossed 
Had now persisted in the woods so long 
That probably it never would be lost. 

Never again would birds’ song be the same. 
And to do that to birds was why she came. 


[ 452 ] 



THE SUBVERTED FLOWER 


She drew back; he was calm: 

‘It is this that had the power 5 
And he lashed his open palm 
With the tender-headed flower. 
He smiled for her to smile, 

But she was either blind 
Or willfully unkind. 

He eyed her for a while 
For a woman and a puzzle. 

He flicked and flung the flower. 
And another sort of smile 
Caught up like finger tips 
The comers of his lips 
And cracked his ragged muzzle. 
She was standing to the waist 
In goldenrod and brake. 

Her shining hair displaced. 

He stretched her either arm 
As if she made it ache 
To clasp her— not to harm; 

As if he could not spare 
To touch her neck and hair. 

‘If this has come to us 
And not to me alone—’ 

So she thought she heard him say; 
Though with every word he spoke 
His lips were sucked and blown 
And die effort made him choke 
Like a tiger at a bone. 

She had to lean away. 

She dared not stir a foot, 

[ 453 ] 



Lest movement should provoke 
The demon of pursuit 
That slumbers in a brute. 

It was then her mother’s call 
From inside the garden wall 
Made her steal a look of fear 
To see if he could hear 
And would pounce to end it all 
Before her mother came. 

She looked and saw the shame: 

A hand hung like a paw. 

An arm worked like a saw 
As if to be persuasive. 

An ingratiating laugh 
That cut the snout in half. 

An eye become evasive. 

A girl could only see 
That a flower had marred a man. 
But what she could not see 
Was that the flower might be 
Other than base and fetid: 

That the flower had done but part. 
And what the flower began 
Her own too meager heart 
Had terribly completed. 

She looked and saw the worst. 

And the dog or what it was. 
Obeying bestial laws, 

A coward save at night, 

Turned from the place and ran. 

She heard him stumble first 
And use his hands in flight 
She heard him bark outright. 
[ 454 ] 



And oh, for one so young 
The bitter words she spit 
Like some tenacious bit 
That will not leave the tongue. 

She plucked her lips for it. 

And still the horror clung 
Her mother wiped the foam 
From her chin, picked up her comb 
And drew her backward home.

WILLFUL HOMING 


It is getting dark and time he drew to a house, 

But the blizzard blinds him to any house ahead. 

The storm gets down his neck in an icy souse 
That sucks his breath like a wicked cat in bed. 

The snow blows on him and off him, exerting force 
Downward to make him sit astride a drift, 

Imprint a saddle and calmly consider a course. 

He peers out shrewdly into the thick and swift. 

Since he means to come to a door he will come to a door, 
Although so compromised of aim and rate 
He may fumble wide of the knob a yard or more, 

And to those concerned he may seem a little late. 


[ 456 ] 



A CLOUD SHADOW 


A breeze discovered my open book 
And began to flutter the leaves to look 
For a poem there used to be on Spring 
I tried to tell her ‘There’s no such thing!’ 

For whom would a poem on Spring be by? 
The breeze disdained to make reply; 

And a cloud shadow crossed her face 
For fear I would make her miss the place. 


[ 457 ] 



THE QUEST OF THE PURPLE-FRINGED 


I felt the chill of the meadow underfoot, 

But the sun overhead. 

And snatches of verse and song of scenes like this 
I sung or said. 

I skn-ted the margin alders for miles and miles 
In a sweeping line. 

The day was the day by every flower that blooms, 

But I saw no sign. 

Yet further I went to be before the scythe. 

For the grass was high; 

Till I saw the path where the slender fox had come 
And gone panting by. 

Then at last and following him I found— 

In the very hour 

When the color flushed to the petals it must have been- 
The far-sought flower. 

There stood the purple spires with no breath of air 
Nor headlong bee 

To disturb their perfect poise the hvelong day 
’Neath the alder tree. 

I only knelt and putting the boughs aside 
Looked, or at most 

Counted them all to the buds in the copse’s depth 
That were pale as a ghost. 


[ 458 ] 



Then I arose and silently wandered home, 

And I for one 

Said that the fall might come and whnl of leaves, 
For summer was done.

THE DISCOVERY OF THE MADEIRAS 


A RHYME OF HACKLUYT 

A stolen lady was coming on board, 

But whether stolen from her wedded lord 
Or from her own self against her will 
Was not set forth in the lading bill. 

A stolen lady was all it said. 

She came down weakly and blindly led 
To the darkening windy village slip. 

She would not look at the fateful ship. 

Her lover to make the ordeal swift 
Had to give her the final lift 
And force her farewell step off shore. 

The way she clung to him the more 
Seemed to argue perhaps she went 
Not entirely without consent. 

But with no companion of womankind 
To leave the English law behind 
And sail for some vague Paphian bourn 
Began already to seem forlorn. 

It did more distance up and down. 

Their little stormy ship, than on. 

Now it took a fitful run, 

Now standing cracked its sail and spun, 
Now stood upon its bulging prow 
Till the pirate sailors made a vow 
Of where they would go on pilgrimage 
If God would spare them to die of age. 
When the clap of two converging waves 
Failed to crush their barrel staves, 

[ 460 ] 



Or the wind to snap their walking stick, 
They laughed as if they had turned a trick. 

This was no lady’s time of year. 

For long the lady would disappear, 

And might be rolling dead below 
For all the crew were let to know. 

But when the ocean’s worst had passed 
She was carried out beside the mast. 
Where all day long she lay and dozed. 

Or she and her lover would sit opposed 
And darkly drink each other’s eyes 
With famt head shakings, no more wise. 
The most he asked her eyes to grant 
Was that in what she does not want 
A woman wants to be overruled. 

Or was the instinct in him fooled? 

He knew not, neither of them knew. 

They could only say like any two, 

'You tell me and I’ll tell you.’ 

Sometimes with her permissive smile 
He left her to her thoughts awhile 
And went to lean against the rail, 

And let the captain tell him a tale. 

(He had to keep the captain’s favor.) 

The ship it seemed had been a slaver. 

And once they had shipped a captive pair 
Whose love was such they didn’t care 
Who took in them onlooker’s share. 

Well, when at length the fever struck 
That spoils the nigger-trader’s luck 
The man was among the first it took. 

[ 461 ] 



'Throw him over alive,’ they said, 

‘Before the thing has time to spread. 

You’ve got to keep the quarters clean.’ 

But the girl fought them and made a scene. 
She was a savage jungle cat 
It was easy to be angry at; 

Which put the thought into someone’s head 
Of the ocean bed for a marriage bed 
Some Tom said to Dick or Harry: 

‘Apparendy these two ought to marry. 

We get plenty funerals at sea. 

How for a change would a wedding be?— 

Or a combination of the two, 

How would a funeral-wedding do? 

It’s gone so far she’s probably caught 
Whatever it is the mgger’s got.’ 

They bound them naked so they faced 
With a length of cordage about the waist, 
Many lovers have been divorced 
By having what is free enforced 
But presence of love these had in death 
To kiss and drink each other’s breath 
Before they were hurled from the slaver’s deck. 
They added clasps about the neck 
And went embraced to the cold and dark 
To be their own marriage feast for the shark. 

When after talk with other men 
A man comes back to a woman again 
He tells her as much of blood and dirt 
As he thinks will do her not too much hurt. 
“What was the pirate captain’s chaff? 

He laughed but he did not make you laugh. 

[ 462 ] 



The jest seemed liis and the plaudits his. 

I heard him shout “What a thing it is!” 

Some standing jest between you men? 

Don’t tell me if you don’t want to then.’ 
Whereat in a moment of cioss unruth 
He thought, ‘AH right if ).ou want the truth!’ 
T don’t believe it! It isn’t true! 

It never happened! Did it, you?’ 

Seeing no help m wings or feet 
She withdrew back in self-retreat 
Till her heart almost ceased to beat. 

Her spirit faded as far away 
As the living ever go yet stay. 

And her thought was she had had her pay 

He said to the captain, ‘Give command, 

And bring us to the nearest land; 

And let us try an untossed place 
And see if it will help her case.’ 

They brought her to a nameless isle. 

And the ship lay in the bay for a while 
Waiting to see if she would mend; 

But sailed and left them in the end. 

Her lover saw them sail away. 

But dared not tell her all one day. 

For slowly even her sense of him 
And love itself were growing dim. 

He no more drew the smile he sought 
The story is she died of thought. 

And when her lover was left alone 
He stayed long enough to carve on stone 
The name of the lady with his own 
To be her only marriage lines. 

[ 463 ] 



And carved them round with a scioll of vines. 
Then he gouged a clumsy sailing trough 
From a fallen tree and pushing off 
Safely made the African shore, 

Where he fell a prisoner to the Moor. 

But the Moor strangely enough believed 
The tale of the voyage he had achieved, 

And sent him to the King to admire. 

He came at last to his native shire. 

The island he found was verified. 

And the bay where his stolen lady died 
Was named for him mstead of her. 

But so is history like to err. 

And soon it is neither here nor there 
Whether time’s rewards are fair or unfair. 


[ 464 ] 



TWO OR MORE 




THE GIFT OUTRIGHT 


The land was ours before we were the land’s. 
She was our land more than a hundred years 
Before we were her people. She was ours 
In Massachusetts, in Virginia, 

But we were England’s, still colonials. 
Possessing what we still were unpossessed by. 
Possessed by what we now no more possessed. 
Something we were withholding made us weak 
Until we found out that it was ourselves 
We were withholding from our land of living. 
And forthwith found salvation in surrender 
Such as we were we gave ourselves outright 
(The deed of gift was many deeds of war) 

To the land vaguely realizing westward, 

But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced. 

Such as she was, such as she would become. 


[ 467 ] 



TRIPLE BRONZE 


The Infinite’s being so wide 
Is the reason the Powers provide 
For inner defense my hide. 

For next defense outside 

I make myself this time 
Of wood or granite or lime 
A wall too hard for crime 
Either to breach or climb. 

Then a number of us agree 
On a national boundary. 

And that defense makes three 
Between too much and me. 


[ 468 ] 



OUR HOLD ON THE PLANET 


We asked for rain. It didn’t flash and roar. 

It didn’t lose its temper at our demand 
And blow a gale. It didn’t misunderstand 
And give us more than our spokesman bargained for, 
And just because we owned to a wish for ram, 

Send us a flood and bid us be damned and drown 
It gently threw us a glittering shower down. 

And when we had taken that into the roots of gram, 
It threw us another and then another still 
Till the spongy soil again was natal wet. 

We may doubt the just proportion of good to ill. 
There is much in nature against us. But we forget: 
Take nature altogether since time began, 

Including human nature, in peace and war. 

And it must be a little more in favor of man, 

Say a fraction of one per cent at the very least. 

Or our number living wouldn’t be steadily more, 

Our hold on the planet wouldn’t have so increased. 


[ 469 ] 



TO A YOUNG WRETCH 
(boethian) 

As gay for you to take your father’s ax 
As take his gun— rod— to go hunting— fishing. 

You nick my spruce until its fiber cracks, 

It gives up standmg straight and goes down swishing. 

You link an arm in its arm and you lean 

Across the light snow homeward smelling green. 

I could have bought you just as good a tree 
To frizzle resin in a candle flame. 

And what a saving ’twould have meant to me. 

But tree by charity is not the same 
As tree by enterprise and expedition. 

I must not spoil your Christmas with contrition. 

It is your Christmases against my woods. 

But even where thus opposing interests kill, 

They are to be thought of as opposing goods 
Oftener than as conflicting good and ill; 

Which makes the war god seem no special dunce 
For always fighting on both sides at once. 

And though in tinsel chain and popcorn rope. 

My tree a captive in your window bay 
Has lost its footing on my mountain slope 
And lost the stars of heaven, may, oh, may 
The symbol star it lifts against your ceiling 
Help me accept its fate with Christmas feeling. 


[ 470 ] 



THE LESSON FOR TODAY 


If this uncertain age in which we dwell 
Were really as dark as I hear sages tell, 

And I convinced that they were really sages, 

I should not curse myself with it to hell, 

But leaving not the chair I long have sat in, 

I should betake me back ten thousand pages 
To the world’s undebatably dark ages, 

And getting up my medieval Latin, 

Seek converse common cause and brotherhood 
(By all that’s liberal— I should, I should) 

With poets who could calmly take the fate 
Of being born at once too early and late, 

And for these reasons kept from bemg great. 

Yet singing but Dione in the wood 
And ver aspergit terrain floribus 
They slowly led old Latin verse to rhyme 
And to forget the ancient lengths of time. 

And so began the modern world for us. 

I’d say, O Master of the Palace School, 

You were not Charles’ nor anybody’s fool: 

Tell me as pedagogue to pedagogue, 

You did not know that smce King Charles did rule 
You had no chance but to be minor, did you? 
Your light was spent perhaps as in a fog 
That at once kept you burning low and hid you. 
The age may very well have been to blame 
For your not having won to Virgil’s fame. 

But no one ever heard you make the claim. 

You would not think you knew enough to judge 
The age when full upon you. That’s my point. 
[ 471 ] 



We have today and I could call their name 
Who know exactly what is out of joint 
To make their verse and their excuses lame. 
They’ve tried to grasp with too much social fact 
Too large a situation, You and I 
Would be afraid if we should comprehend 
And get outside of too much bad statistics 
Our muscles never could again contract: 

We never could recover human shape, 

But must live lives out mentally agape. 

Or die of philosophical distention. 

That’s how we feel— and we’re no special mystics. 

We can’t appraise the time in which we act. 

But for the folly of it, let’s pretend 
We know enough to know it for adverse. 

One more millennium’s about to end. 

Let’s celebrate the event, my distant friend, 

In publicly disputing which is worse, 

The present age or your age. You and I 
As schoolmen of repute should qualify 
To wage a fine scholastical contention 
As to whose age deserves the lower mark, 

Or should I say the higher one, for dark. 

I can just hear the way you make it go: 

There’s always something to be sorry for, 

A sordid peace or an outrageous war. 

Yes, yes, of course. We have the same convention. 
The groundwork of all faith is human woe. 

It was well worth preliminary mention. 

There’s nothing but injustice to be had, 

No choice is left a poet, you might add, 

But how to take the curse, tragic or comic. 

[ 472 ] 



It was well worth preliminary mention 
But let’s go on to where our cases part, 

If part they do. Let me propose a start 
(We re rivals in the badness of our case, 
Remember, and must keep a solemn face ) 

Space ails us modems: we are sick with space. 

Its contemplation makes us out as small 

As a brief epidemic of microbes 

That in a good glass may be seen to crawl 

The patina of this the least of globes 

But have we there the advantage after all? 

You were belittled into vilest worms 
God hardly tolerated with his feet. 

Which comes to the same thing in different terms 
We both are the belittled human race, 

One as compared with God and one with space. 
I had thought ours the more profound disgrace, 
But doubtless this was only my conceit. 

The cloister and the observatory saint 
Take comfort in about the same complaint. 

So science and religion really meet. 

I can just hear you call your Palace class: 
Come learn the Latin Eheu for alas. 

You may not want to use it and you may. 

O paladins, the lesson for today 
Is how to be unhappy yet polite. 

And at the summons Roland, Olivier, 

And every sheepish paladin and peer, 

Being already more than proved in fight, 

Sits down in school to try if he can write 
T.ike Horace in the true Horatian vein. 


[ 473 ] 



Yet like a Christian disciplined to bend 
His mind to thinking always of the end. 
Memento mon and obey the Lord 
Art and religion love the somber chord. 

Earth’s a hard place in which to save the soul. 
And could it be brought under state control. 

So automatically we all were saved, 

Its separateness from Heaven could be waived; 
It might as well at once be kingdom-come. 
(Perhaps it will be next millennium ) 

But these are universals, not confined 
To any one time, place, or human kind. 

We re either nothing or a God’s regret. 

As ever when philosophers are met, 

No matter where they stoutly mean to get. 

Nor what particulars they reason from, 

They are philosophers, and from old habit 
They end up m the universal Whole 
As unoriginal as any rabbit 

One age is like another for the soul. 

I’m telling you. You haven’t said a thing. 

Unless I put it in your mouth to say. 

I’m having the whole argument my way— 

But in your favor— please to tell your King- 
In having granted you all ages shine 
With equal darkness, yours as dark as mine. 

I’m liberal. You, you aristocrat, 

Won’t know exactly what I mean by that. 

I mean so altruistically moral 
I never take my own side in a quarrel. 


[ 474 ] 



I’d lay my hand on his hand on his staff, 

Lean back and have my confidential laugh. 

And tell lnm I had read his Epitaph 

It sent me to the graves the other day. 

The only other there was far away 
Across the landscape with a watering pot 
At his devotions in a special plot 
And he was there resuscitating flowers 
(Make no mistake about its being bones), 

But I was only there to read the stones 
To see what on the whole they had to say 
About how long a man may think to five, 

Which is becoming my concern of late. 

And very wide the choice they seemed to give, 
The ages ranging all the way from hours 
To months and years and many many years. 

One man had lived one hundred years and eight. 
But though we all may be inclined to wait 
And follow some development of state, 

Or see what comes of science and invention. 
There is a limit to our time extension. 

We all are doomed to broken-off careers, 

And so’s the nation, so’s the total race. 

The earth itself is liable to the fate 
Of meaninglessly bemg broken off. 

(And hence so many literary tears 
At which my inclination is to scoff.) 

I may have wept that any should have died 
Or missed their chance, or not have been their best, 
Or been then riches, fame, or love denied; 

On me as much as any is the jest. 


[ 475 ] 



I take my incompleteness with the rest. 

God bless himself can no one else be blessed. 


I hold your doctrine of Memento Mori. 
And were an epitaph to be my story 
I’d have a short one ready for my own. 

I would have written of me on my stone: 

I had a lover’s quarrel with the world.

TIME OUT 




TIME OUT 


It took that pause to make him realize 
The mountain he was climbmg had the slant 
As of a book held up before his eyes 
(And was a text albeit done in plant). 

Dwarf cornel, gold-thread, and maianthemum, 
He followingly fingered as he read, 

The flowers fading on the seed to come. 

But the thing was the slope it gave his head. 
The same for readmg as it was for thought. 

So different from the hard and level stare 
Of enemies defied and battles fought 
It was the obstinately gentle air 
That may be clamored at by cause and sect 
But it will have its moment to reflect.

TO A MOTH SEEN IN WINTER 


Here’s first a gloveless hand warm from my pocket, 

A perch and resting place ’twixt wood and wood. 
Bright-black-eyed silvery creature, brushed with brown, 
The wings not folded in repose, but spread. 

(Who would you be, I wonder, by those marks 
If I had moths to friend as I have flowers?) 

And now pray tell what lured you with false hope 

To make the venture of eternity 

And seek the love of kind in wintertime? 

But stay and hear me out. I surely think 
You make a labor of flight for one so airy, 

Spending yourself too much in self-support 
Nor will you find love either nor love you. 

And what I pity in you is something human. 

The old incurable untimeliness, 

Only begetter of all ills that are. 

But go. You are right. My pity cannot help. 

Go till you wet your pinions and are quenched. 

You must be made more simply wise than I 
To know the hand I stretch impulsively 
Across the gulf of well nigh everything 
May reach to you, but cannot touch your fate. 

I cannot touch your life, much less can save, 

Who am tasked to save my own a little while.

A CONSIDERABLE SPECK 
(microscopic) 

A speck that would have been beneath my sight 

On any but a paper sheet so white 

Set off across what I had written there. 

And I had idly poised my pen in air 
To stop it with a period of ink 
When something strange about it made me think. 
This was no dust speck by my breathing blown. 
But unmistakably a living mite 
With inclinations it could call its own. 

It paused as with suspicion of my pen, 

And then came racing wildly on again 
To where my manuscript was not yet dry; 

Then paused again and either drank or smelt— 
With loathing, for again it turned to fly. 

Plainly with an intelligence I dealt. 

It seemed too tiny to have room for feet, 

Yet must have had a set of them complete 
To express how much it didn’t want to die. 

It ran with terror and with cunning crept. 

It faltered: I could see it hesitate; 

Then in the middle of the open sheet 
Cower down in desperation to accept 
Whatever I accorded it of fate. 

I have none of the tenderer-than-thou 

Collectivistic regimenting love 

With which the modem world is being swept. 

But this poor microscopic item now! 

Since it was nothing I knew evil of 
I let it lie there till I hope it slept. 


[ 481 ] 



I have a mind myself and recognize 
Mind when I meet with it in any guise. 
No one can know how glad I am to find 
On any sheet the least display of mmd.

THE LOST FOLLOWER 


As I have known them passionate and fine 
The gold fc r which thev lea\ e the golden line 
Of lync is a golden light divine. 

Never the gold of darkness from a mine. 

The spirit plays us strange religious pranks 
To whatsoever god we owe the thanks. 

No one has ever failed the poet ranks 
To link a chain of money-metal banks 

The loss to song, the danger of defection 
Is always in the opposite direction. 

Some turn m sheer, in Shelleyan dejection 
To try if one more popular election 

Will give us by short cut the final stage 
That poetry with all its golden rage 
For beauty on the illuminated page 
Has failed to bring— I mean the Golden Age. 

And if this may not be (and nothing’s sure). 

At least to live ungolden with the poor, 
Enduring what the ungolden must endure. 

This has been poetry’s great anti-lure. 

The muse mourns one who went to his retreat 
Long smce in some abysmal city street. 

The bnde who shared the crust he broke to eat 
As grave as he about the world’s defeat. 


[ 483 ] 



With such it has proved dangerous as friend 
Even in a playful moment to contend 
That the millennium to which you bend 
In longing is not at a progress-end 

By grace of state-manipulated pelf. 

Or politics of Ghibelline or Guelph, 

But right beside you book-like on a shelf, 

Or even better god-like in yourself. 

He trusts my love too well to deign reply. 

But there is in the sadness of his eye, 
Something about a kingdom in the sky 
(As yet unbrought to earth) he means to try.

NOVEMBER 


We saw leaves go to glory. 

Then almost migratory 
Go part way down the lane. 
And then to end the story 
Get beaten down and pasted 
In one wild day of rain. 

We heard ‘ ’Tis over’ roaring 
A year of leaves was wasted. 
Oh, we make a boast of storing, 
Of saving and of keepmg, 

But only by ignoring 
The waste of moments sleeping, 
The waste of pleasure weepmg, 
By denymg and ignoring 
The waste of nations warring 
1938

THE RABBIT HUNTER 


Careless and still 
The hunter lurks 
With gun depressed. 
Facing alone 
The alder swamps 
Ghastly snow-white. 
And his hound works 
In the offing there 
Like one possessed, 
And yelps delight 
And sings and romps. 
Bringing him on 
The shadowy hare 
For him to rend 
And deal a death 
That he nor it 
(Nor I) have wit 
To comprehend. 


[ 486 ] 



A LOOSE MOUNTAIN 
(telescopic) 


Did you stay up last night (the Magi did) 

To see the star shower known as Leonid 
That once a year by hand or apparatus 
Is so mysteriously pelted at us ? 

It is but fiery puffs of dust and pebbles. 

No doubt directed at our heads as rebels 

In having taken artificial light 

Against the ancient sovereignty of night. 

A fusillade of blanks and empty flashes, 

It never reaches earth except as ashes 

Of which you feel no least touch on your face 

Nor find in dew the slightest cloudy trace. 

Nevertheless it constitutes a hint 

That the loose mountain lately seen to glint 

In sunlight near us in momentous swing 

Is something in a Balearic sling 

The heartless and enormous Outer Black 

Is still withholding in the Zodiac 

But from irresolution in his back 

About when best to have us m our orbit. 

So we won’t simply take it and absorb it. 


[ 487 ] 



IT IS ALMOST THE YEAR 
TWO THOUSAND 


To start the world of old 
We had one age of gold 
Not labored out of mines, 
And some say there are signs 
The second such has come. 
The true Millennium, 

The final golden glow 
To end it. And if so 
(And science ought to know) 
We well may raise our heads 
From weeding garden beds 
And annotating books 
To watch this end de luxe.

QUANTULA 




IN A POEM 


The sentencing goes blithely on its way, 
And takes the playfully objected rhyme 
As surely as it keeps the stroke and time 
In having its undeviable say.

ON OUR SYMPATHY WITH 
THE UNDER DOG 


First under up and then again down under. 
We watch a circus of revolving dogs 
No senator dares in to kick asunder 
Lest both should bite him in the toga-togs. 


[ 492 ] 



A QUESTION 


A voice said, Look me m the stars 
And tell me truly, men of earth, 

If all the soul-and-body scars 
Were not too much to pay for birth. 


[ 493 ] 



BOEOTIAN 


I love to toy with the Platonic notion 
That wisdom need not be of Athens Attic, 
But well may be Laconic, even Boeotian. 
At least I will not have it systematic. 


[ 494 ] 



THE SECRET SITS 


We dance round in a rmg and suppose, 
But the Secret sits m the middle and knows. 


[ 495 ] 



AN EQUALIZER 


It is as true as Caesar s name was Kaiser 
That no economist was ever wiser 
(Though prodigal himself and a despiser 
Of capital and calling thrift a miser). 

And when we get too far apart in wealth, 

’Twas his idea that for the public health, 

So that the poor wont have to steal by stealth, 
We now and then should take an equalizer. 


[ 496 ] 



A SEMI-REVOLUTION 


I advocate a semi-revolution. 

The trouble with a total revolution 
(Ask any leputable Rosicrucian) 

Is that it brings the same class up on top. 

Executives of skillful execution 

Will therefore plan to go halfway and stop. 

Yes, revolutions are the only salves, 

But they’re one thing that should be done by halves. 


[ 497 ] 



ASSURANCE 


The danger not an inch outside 
Behind the porthole’s slab of glass 
And double ring of fitted brass 
I trust feels properly defied.

AN ANSWER 


But Islands of the Blessed, bless you, son, 
I never came upon a blessed one.

OVER BACK 




TRESPASS 


No, I had set no prohibiting sign, 

And yes, my land was hardly fenced. 
Nevertheless the land was mine. 

I was being trespassed on and against. 

Whoever the surly freedom took 
Of such an unaccountable stay 
Busying by my woods and brook 
Gave me strangely restless day. 

He might be opening leaves of stone. 

The picture-book of the trilobite, 

For which the region round was known. 
And in which there was little pioperty right 

’Twas not the value I stood to lose 
In specimen crab m specimen rock. 

But his ignoring what was whose 
That made me look again at the clock. 

Then came his little acknowledgment. 

He asked for a drink at the kitchen door. 

An errand he may have had to invent, 

But it made my property mine once more. 


[ 503 ] 



A NATURE NOTE 


Four or five whippoorwills 

Have come down from their native ledge 

To the open country edge 

To give us a piece of their bills 

Two in June were a pair— 

You’d say sufficiently loud, 

But this was a family crowd, 

A full-fledged family affair. 

All out of time pell-mell! 

I wasn’t in on the joke 
Unless it was coming to folk 
To bid us a mock farewell. 

I took note of when it occurred. 

The twenty-third of September, 

Their latest that I remember, 

September the twenty-third. 


[ 504 ] 



OF THE STONES OF THE PLACE 


I farm a pasture where the boulders lie 
As touching as a basket full of eggs. 

And though they’re nothing anybody begs, 

I wonder if it wouldn’t signify 

For me to send you one out where you live 
In wind-soil to a depth of thirty feet, 

And every acre good enough to eat, 

As fine as flour put through a baker’s sieve. 

I’d ship a smooth one you could slap and chafe, 
And set up like a statue in your yard, 

An eohth palladium to guard 

The West and keep the old tradition safe. 

Carve nothing on it. You can simply say 
In self-defense to quizzical inquiry: 

‘The portrait of the soul of my gransir Ira. 

It came from where he came from anyway.’ 


[ 505 ] 



NOT OF SCHOOL AGE 


Around bend after bend. 

It was blown woods and no end. 

I came to but one house 
I made but the one friend. 

At the one house a child was out 
Who drew back at first m doubt. 

But spoke to me m a gale 
That blew so he had to shout. 

His cheek smeared with apple sand, 

A part apple in his hand, 

He pointed on up the road 
As one havmg war-command. 

A parent, his gentler one, 

Looked forth on her small son. 

And wondered with me there 
What now was being done. 

His accent was not good 
But I slowly understood. 

Something where I could go— 

He couldn’t but I could. 

He was too young to go. 

Not over four or so. 

Well, would I please go to school, 

And the big flag they had— you know 


[ 506 ] 



The big flag, the red— white— 
And blue flag, the gieat sight— 
He bet it was out today. 

And would I see if he was right? 


1932 


[ 507 ] 



A SERIOUS STEP LIGHTLY TAKEN 


Between two burrs on the map 
Was a hollow-headed snake. 

The burrs were hills, the snake was a stream. 
And the hollow head was a lake. 

And the dot in front of a name 
Was what should be a town. 

And there might be a house we could buy 
For only a dollar down. 

With two wheels low in the ditch 
We left our boiling car, 

And knocked at the door of a house we found. 
And there today we are. 

It is turning three hundred years 

On our cisatlantic shore 

For family after family name. 

We’ll make it three hundred more 

For our name farming here. 

Aloof yet not aloof. 

Enriching soil and increasing stock. 

Repairing fence and roof, 

A hundred thousand days 
Of front-page paper events, 

A half a dozen major wars. 

And forty-five presidents.

THE LITERATE FARMER AND THE 
PLANET VENUS 

A Dated Popular-Science Medley 
on a Mysterious Light Recently Observed in the 
Western Sky at Evening 

My unexpected knocking at the door 
Started chairs thundering on the kitchen floor. 
Knives and forks ringing on the supper plates. 
Voices conflicting like the candidates. 

A mighty fanner flung the house door wide. 

He and a lot of children came outside, 

And there on an equality we stood. 

That’s the time knocking at a door did good. 

1 stopped to compliment you on this star 
You get the beauty of from where you are. 

To see it so, the bright and only one 
In sunset light, you’d think it was the sun 
That hadn’t sunk the way it should have sunk. 

But right in heaven was slowly being shrunk 
So small as to be virtually gone, 

Yet there to watch the darkness commg on— 

Like someone dead permitted to exist 
Enough to see if he was greatly missed. 

I didn’t see the sun set. Did it set? 

Will anybody swear that isn’t it? 

And will you give me shelter for the night? 

If not, a glass of milk will be all right.’ 

‘Traveler, I’m glad you asked about that light. 
Your mind mistrusted there was something wrong, 
[ 509 ] 



And naturally you couldn't go along 
Without inquiring if 'twas serious 
'Twas providential you applied to us, 

Who weie just on the subject when you came. 
There is a star that's Senous by name 
And nature too, but this is not the same. 

This light's been going on for seveial years, 

Although at times we think it disappears 

You'll hear all sorts of things You'll meet with them 

Will tell you it's the star of Bethlehem 

Above some more religion in a manger 

But put that down to superstition, Stranger. 

What's a star doing big as a baseball? 

Between us two it’s not a star at all. 

It's a new patented electric light. 

Put up on trial by that Jerseyite 
So much is being now expected of, 

To give developments the final shove 
And turn us mto the next specie folks 
Are going to be, unless these monkey jokes 
Of the last fifty years are all a libel, 

And Darwm's proved mistaken, not the Bible. 

I s'pose you have your notions on the vexed 
Question of what we're turning mto next.' 

'As liberals we're willing to give place 
To any demonstrably better race, 

No matter what the color of its skm 
(But what a human race the white has been!) 

I heard a fellow in a public lecture 
On Pueblo Indians and their architecture 
Declare that if such Indians inherited 
The condemned world the legacy was merited. 
[ 510 ] 



So far as he, the speaker, was concerned 
He had his ticket bought, his passage earned, 
To take the Mayflower back wheie he belonged 
Before the Indian race was further wronged. 
But come, enhghtened as in talk you seem, 

You don’t believe that that first-water gleam 
Is not a star?’ 

‘Believe it? Why, I know it 
Its actions any cloudless night will show it. 
You’ll see it be allowed up just so high. 

Say about halfway up the western sky, 

And then get slowly, slowly pulled back down. 
You might not notice if you’ve lived m town. 

As I suspect you have. A town debars 
Much notice of what’s going on m stais. 

The idea is no doubt to make one job 
Of lightmg the whole night with one big blob 
Of electricity in bulk the way 
The sun sets the example in the day.’ 

‘Here come more stars to character the skies, 
And they in the estimation of the wise 
Are more divine than any bulb or arc, 

Because their purpose is to flash and spark. 

But not to take away the precious dark. 

We need the interruption of the night 
To ease attention off when overtight, 

To break our logic m too long a flight, 

And ask us if our premises are right.’ 

‘Sick talk, sick talk, sick sentimental talk! 

It doesn’t do you any good to walk. 

[ 511 ] 



I see what you are. can’t get you excited 
With hopes of getting mankind unbemghted. 
Some ignorance takes rank as innocence 
Have it for all of me and have it dense. 

The slave will never thank his manumitter; 
Which often makes the manumitter bitter.’ 

Tn short, you t hi nk that star a patent medicine 
Put up to cure the world by Mr. Edison ’ 

‘You said it— that’s exactly what it is. 

My son in Jersey says a friend of his 
Knows the old man and nobody’s so deep 
In incandescent lamps and ending sleep 
The old man argues science cheapened speed. 

A good cheap anti-dark is now the need. 

Give us a good cheap twenty-four-hour day. 

No part of which we’d have to waste, I say. 

And who knows where we can’t get! Wastmg time 
In sleep or slowness is the deadly crime. 

He gave up sleep himself some time ago. 

It puffs the face and brutalizes so. 

You take the ugliness all so much dread. 

Called getting out of the wrong side of bed 
That is the source perhaps of human hate, 

And well may be where wars originate. 

Get rid of that and there’d be left no great 
Of either murder or war in any land. 

You know how cunningly mankind is planned: 
We have one loving and one hating hand. 

The loving’s made to hold each other like, 

While with the hating other hand we strike. 


[ 512 ] 



The blow can be no stronger than the clutch, 

Or soon we’d bat each othei out of touch, 

And the fray wouldn’t last a single round. 

And still it’s bad enough to badly wound. 

And if our getting up to stait the day 
On the right side of bed would end the fray, 
We’d hail the remedy But it’s been tried 
And found, he says, a bed has no right side. 

The trouble is, with that receipt for love, 

A bed’s got no right side to get out of 
We can’t be trusted to the sleep we take, 

And simply must evolve to stay awake 
He thinks that chairs and tables will endure. 

But beds— in less than fifty years he’s sure 
There will be no such piece of furniture. 

He’s surely got it in for cots and beds. 

No need for us to rack our common heads 
About it, though. We haven’t got the mind. 

It best be left to great men of his kind 
Who have no other object than our good. 

There’s a lot yet that isn’t understood. 

Ain’t it a caution to us not to fix 

No limits to what rose in rubbing sticks 

On fire to scare away the pterodix 

When man first lived in caves along the creeks?’ 

‘Marvelous world in nineteen-twenty-six.’ 


[ 513 ] 




STEEPLE 

BUSH 




A YOUNG BIRCH 


The birch begins to crack its outer sheath 
Of baby green and show the white beneath. 

As whosoever likes the young and slight 
May well have noticed. Soon entirely white 
To double day and cut in half the daik 
It will stand forth, entirely white in bark. 

And nothing but the top a leafy green— 

The only native tree that dares to lean. 

Relying on its beauty, to the air. 

(Less brave perhaps than trusting are the fair.) 
And someone reminiscent will recall 
How once in cuttmg brush along the wall 
He spared it from the number of the slain, 

At first to be no bigger than a cane, 

And then no bigger than a fishing pole. 

But now at last so obvious a bole 

The most efficient help you ever hired 

Would know that it was there to be admired, 

And zeal would not be thanked that cut it down 
When you were reading books or out of town. 

It was a tiling of beauty and was sent 
To live its life out as an ornament. 


[ 517 ] 



SOMETHING FOR HOPE 


At the present rate it must come to pass 
And that right soon that the meadow sweet 
And steeple bush not good to eat 
Will have crowded out the edible grass 

Then all there is to do is wait 
For maple birch and spruce to push 
Through meadow sweet and steeple bush 
And crowd them out at a similar rate 

No plow among these rocks would pay. 

So busy yourself with other things 

While the trees put on their wooden rmgs 

And with long-sleeved branches hold their sway 

Then cut down the trees when lumbei grown, 
And there’s your pristine earth all freed 
From lovely blooming but wasteful weed 
And ready again for the grass to own. 

A cycle we’ll say of a hundred years 
Thus foresight does it and laissez faire, 

A virtue in which we all may share 
Unless a government mterferes 

Patience and looking away ahead, 

And leaving some things to take their course. 

Hope may not nourish a cow or horse, 

But spes aht agricolam ’tis said. 



ONE STEP BACKWARD TAKEN 


Not only sands and giavels 
Were once more on theii travels, 

But gulping muddy gallons 
Great bouldeis off their balance 
Bumped heads together dully 
And started down the gully. 

Whole capes caked off in slices. 

I felt my standpoint shaken 
In the universal cusis 
But with one step backward taken 
I saved myself from going. 

A world torn loose went by me. 

Then the rain stopped and the blowing 
And the sun came out to dry me. 


[ 519 ] 



DIRECTIVE 


Back out of all this now too much for us, 

Back m a tune made simple by the loss 
Of detail, burned, dissolved, and bioken off 
Like graveyard marble sculpture m the weather. 
There is a house that is no more a house 
L T pon a farm that is no more a farm 
And in a town that is no more a town. 

Hie road there, if you’ll let a guide direct you 
Who only has at heart your getting lost, 

May seem as if it should have been a quarry— 
Great monohthic knees the former town 
Long smce gave up pretense of keeping covered. 
And there’s a story in a book about it: 

Besides the wear of iron wagon wheels 
The ledges show lines ruled southeast northwest. 
The chisel work of an enormous Glacier 
That braced his feet against the Arctic Pole. 

You must not mind a certain coolness from him 
Still said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain, 
Nor need you mind the serial ordeal 
Of being watched from forty cellar holes 
As if by eye pairs out of forty firkins. 

As for the woods’ excitement over you 
That sends light rustle rushes to their leaves. 
Charge that to upstart inexperience 
Where were they all not twenty years ago? 

They think too much of having shaded out 
A few old pecker-fretted apple trees. 

Make yourself up a cheering song of how 
Someone’s road home from work this once was. 
Who may be just ahead of you on foot 

[ 520 ] 



Or creaking with a buggy load of gram 
The height of the adventure is the height 
Of country where two village cultures faded 
Into each other. Both of them aie lost 
And if you’ie lost enough to find yourself 
By now, pull in your ladder road behind you 
And put a sign up closed to all but me 
Then make yourself at home. The only field 
Now left’s no bigger than a harness gall. 

First there’s the children’s house of make believe, 
Some shattered dishes underneath a pine, 

The playthings in the playhouse of the children 
Weep for what little things could make them glad. 
Then for the house that is no more a house, 

But only a belilaced cellar hole, 

Now slowly closing like a dent in dough. 

This was no playhouse but a house m earnest. 

Your destination and your destiny’s 
A biook that was the water of the house. 

Cold as a spring as yet so near its source, 

Too lofty and original to rage. 

(We know the valley streams that when aroused 
Will leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.) 

I have kept hidden in the instep arch 
Of an old cedar at the waterside 
A bioken drinking goblet like the Grail 
Under a spell so the wrong ones can’t find it, 

So can’t get saved, as Samt Mark says they mustn’t. 
(I stole the goblet from the children’s playhouse.) 
Here are your waters and your watering place. 
Drink and be whole again beyond confusion. 


[ 521 ] 



TOO ANXIOUS FOR RIVERS 


Look down the long valley and there stands a mountain 
That someone has said is the end of the world. 

Then what of this liver that having arisen 
Must find where to pour itself into and empty? 

I never saw so much swift water run cloudless. 

Oh, I have been often too anxious for rivers 
To leave it to them to get out of their valleys. 

The truth is the river flows mto the canyon 
Of Ceasing to Question What Doesn’t Concern Us, 

As sooner or later we have to cease somewhere. 

No place to get lost like too far in the distance. 

It may be a mercy the dark closes round us 
So broodmgly soon in every direction. 

The world as we know is an elephant’s howdah. 

The elephant stands on the back of a turtle, 

The turtle m turn on a rock in the ocean. 

And how much longer a story has science 
Before she must put out the light on the children 
And tell them the rest of the story is dreammg? 

“You children may dream it and tell it tomorrow ’ 

Time was we were molten, time was we were vapor. 
What set us on fire and what set us revolving 
Lucretius the Epicurean might tell us 
’Twas something we knew all about to begin with 
And needn’t have fared into space like his master 
To find ’twas the effort, the essay of love. 


[ 522 ] 



AN UNSTAMPED LETTER IN OUR RURAL 
LETTER BOX 


Last night your watchdog barked all night 
So once you lose and lit the light. 

It wasn’t someone at your locks. 

No, m your ruial letter box 
I leave this note without a stamp 
To tell you it was just a tramp 
Who used your pasture for a camp. 

There pointed like the pip of spades 
The young spruce made a suite of glades 
So regular that m the dark 
The place was like a city park. 

There I elected to demur 
Beneath a low-slung juniper 
That like a blanket to my chin 
Kept some dew out and some heat in. 

Yet left me freely face to face 
All night with universal space. 

It may have been at two o’clock 
That under me a point of rock 
Developed in the grass and fern, 

And as I woke afraid to turn 
Or so much as uncross my feet. 

Lest having wasted precious heat 
I never should again be warmed, 

The largest firedrop ever formed 
From two stars’ having coalesced 
Went streaking molten down the west. 

And then your tramp astrologer 
From seeing tins undoubted stir 
In Heaven’s firm-set firmament, 

[ 523 ] 



Himself had the equivalent, 

Only within. Inside the brain 
Two memories that long had lam, 

Now quivered toward each other, lipped 
Together, and together shpped, 

And for a moment all was plain 
That men have thought about in vain. 
Please, my involuntary host, 

Forgive me if I seem to boast. 

’Tis possible you may have seen. 

Albeit through a rusty screen, 

The same sign Heaven showed your guest. 
Each knows his own discernment best. 

You have had your advantages. 

Things must have happened to you, yes. 
And have occurred to you no doubt. 

If not indeed from sleepmg out. 

Then from the work you went about 
In fanning well— or pretty well. 

And it is partly to compel 
Myself, in forma pauperis. 

To say as much I write you this. 


[ 524 ] 



TO AN ANCIENT 


Your claims to immoitality were two. 

The one you made, the other one you grew. 
Sorry to have no name for you but You 

We never knew exactly where to look. 

But found one in the delta of a brook, 

One in a cavern where you used to cook 

Commg on such an ancient human trace 
Seems as expressive of the human race 
As meeting someone living face to face. 

We date you by your depth in silt and dust 
Your probable brute nature is discussed. 

At which point we are totally nonplussed. 

You made the eolith, you grew the bone, 

The second more peculiarly your own. 

And likely to have been enough alone. 

You make me ask if I would go to time 
Would I gain anything by using rhyme? 

Or aren't the bones enough I live to lime? 


[ 525 ] 




FIVE NOCTURNES 




I THE NIGHT LIGHT 


She always had to bum a light 
Beside her attic bed at night 
It gave bad dreams and broken sleep. 
But helped the Lord her soul to keep 
Good gloom on her was thrown away. 
It is on me by night or day, 

Who have, as I suppose, ahead 
The darkest of it still to dread. 


[ 529 ] 



II. WERE I IN TROUBLE 


Where I could think of no thoioughfare. 

Away on the mountain up far too high, 

A blinding headlight shifted glare 

And began to bounce down a granite stair 

Like a star fresh fallen out of the sky 

And I away in my opposite wood 

Am touched by that umntimate light 

And made feel less alone than I rightly should, 

For traveler there could do me no good 

Were I in trouble with night tonight. 


[ 530 ] 



III. BRAVADO 


Have I not walked without an upwaid look 
Of caution under stars that very well 
Might not have missed me when they shot and felP 
It was a risk I had to take— and took. 


[ 531 ] 



IV. ON MAKING CERTAIN ANYTHING 
HAS HAPPENED 


I could be worse employed 
Than as watcher of the void 
Whose part should be to tell 
What star if any fell. 

Suppose some seed-pearl sun 
Should be the only one. 

Yet still I must report 
Some cluster one star short. 

I should justly hesitate 
To frighten church or state 
By announcing a star down 
From say the Cross or Crown. 

To make sure what star I missed 
I should have to check on my list 
Every star m sight. 

It might take me all night. 


[ 532 ] 



V. IN THE LONG NIGHT 


I would build my house of crystal 
With a solitary friend 
Where the cold cracks like a pistol 
And the needle stands on end. 

We would pour oil on the ingle 
And for want of books recite. 

We would crawl out filing single 
To observe the Northern Light. 

If Etookashoo and Couldlooktoo 
The Esquimaux should call. 

There would be fish raw and cooked too 
And enough drink oil for all. 

As one rankly warm insider 
To another I would say, 

We can rest assured on eider 
There will come another day. 


[ 533 ] 




A SPIRE AND BELFRY 




A MOOD APART 


Once down on my knees to growing plants 
I prodded the earth with a lazy tool 
In time with a medley of sotto chants, 

But becoming aware of some boys from school 
Who had stopped outside the fence to spy, 

I stopped my song and almost heart, 

For any eye is an evil eye 
That looks m on to a mood apart. 


[ 537 ] 



THE FEAR OF GOD 


If you should rise from Nowhere up to Somewhere, 
From being No one up to bemg Someone, 

Be sure to keep repeating to yourself 
You owe it to an arbitrary god 
Whose mercy to you rather than to others 
Won’t bear too critical examination 
Stay unassuming. If for lack of license 
To wear the uniform of who you are. 

You should be tempted to make up for it 
In a subordinating look or tone 
Beware of coming too much to the surface, 

And usmg for apparel what was meant 
To be the curtain of the inmost soul. 


[ 538 ] 



THE FEAR OF MAN 


As a girl no one gallantly attends 

Sets forth for home at midnight from a friend’s— 

She tries to make it in one catch of breath, 

And this is not because she thinks of death. 

The city seems mtopplmg from a height. 

But she can trust it not to fall tonight. 

(It will be taken down before it falls.) 

There scarcely is a light m all its walls 

Except beside a safe inside a bank 

(For which assurance Mammon is to thank). 

But there are httle street lights she should trust 
So jewel steady m the wind and dust. 

Her fear is being spoken by the rude 
And having her exposuie misconstrued. 

May I in my brief bolt across the scene 
Not be misunderstood in what I mean. 


[ 539 ] 



A STEEPLE ON THE HOUSE 


What if it should turn out eternity 
Was but the steeple on our house of hfe 
That made our house of life a house of worship? 
We do not go up theie to sleep at night. 

We do not go up there to live by day. 

Nor need we ever go up there to live. 

A spire and belfry coming on the roof 
Means that a soul is coming on the flesh. 


[ 540 ] 



INNATE HELIUM 


Religious faith is a most fillmg vapor. 

It swirls occluded m us under tight 
Compression to uplift us out of weight— 

As m those buoyant bird bones thm as paper. 
To give them still more buoyancy in flight. 
Some gas hke helium must be innate. 


[ 541 ] 



THE COURAGE TO BE NEW 


I hear the world reciting 
The mistakes of ancient men, 

The brutality and fighting 
They will never have again. 

Heartbroken and disabled 
In body and in mind 
They renew talk of the fabled 
Federation of Mankind. 

But they’re blessed with the acumen 
To suspect the human trait 
Was not the basest human 
That made them militate. 

They will tell you more as soon as 
You tell them what to do 
With their ever breaking newness 
And their courage to be new. 


[ 542 ] 



IOTA SUBSCRIPT 


Seek not in me the big I capital, 

Nor yet the little dotted in me seek. 

If I have in me any I at all, 

’Tis the iota subscript of the Greek. 

So small am I as an attention beggar. 
The letter you will find me subscript to 
Is neither alpha, eta, nor omega. 

But upsilon which is the Greek for you. 


[ 543 ] 




OUT AND AWAY 




THE MIDDLENESS OF THE ROAD 


The road at the top of the rise 
Seems to come to an end 
And take off into the skies. 

So at the distant bend 

It seems to go into a wood, 

The place of standing still 
As long the trees have stood. 

But say what Fancy will. 

The mineral drops that explode 
To drive my ton of car 
Are limited to the road 
They deal with near and far, 

But have almost nothing to do 
With the absolute flight and rest 
The universal blue 
And local green suggest. 


[ 547 ] 



ASTROMETAPHYSICAL 


Lord, I have loved your sky, 

Be it said against or for me. 

Have loved it clear and high, 

Or low and stormy; 

Till I have reeled and stumbled 
From looking up too much, 

And fallen and been humbled 
To wear a crutch. 

My love for every Heaven 
O’er which you, Lord, have lorded, 
From number One to Seven 
Should be rewarded. 

It may not give me hope 
That when I am translated 
My scalp will m the cope 
Be constellated. 

But if that seems to tend 
To my undue renown, 

At least it ought to send 
Me up, not down. 


[ 548 ] 



SKEPTIC 


Far star that tickles for me my sensitive plate 
And fries a couple of ebon atoms white, 

I don’t believe I believe a thing you state. 

I put no faith in the seemmg facts of light. 

I don’t believe I beheve you’re the last in space, 

I don’t beheve you’re anywhere near the last, 

I don’t beheve what makes you red in the face 
Is after explosion going away so fast. 

The universe may or may not be very immense. 

As a matter of fact there are times when I am apt 

To feel it close in tight against my sense 

Like a caul m which I was bom and still am wrapped. 


[ 549 ] 



TWO LEADING LIGHTS 


I never happened to contrast 

The two m the celestial cast 

Whose prominence has been so vast 

The Sun is satisfied with days 

He never has in any phase 

That I have heard of shone at night. 

And yet he is a power of light 
And could in one burst overwhelm 
And dayify the darkest realm 
By right of eminent domain. 

He has the greatness to refrain. 

The Moon for all her light and grace 
Has never learned to know her place. 
The notedest astronomers 
Have set the dark aside for hers. 

But there are many nights though clear 
She doesn’t bother to appear. 

Some lunatic or lunar whim 
Will bring her out diminished dim 
To set herself beside the Sun 
As Sheba came to Solomon. 

It may be charitably guessed 
Comparison is not her quest. 

Some rumor of his wishing ring 
That changes winter into spring 
Has brought her merely visiting. 

An irresponsible divinity 
Presuming on her femininity. 


[ 550 ] 



A ROGERS GROUP 


How young and unassuming 
They waited in the street, 

With babies in their arms 
And baggage at their feet. 

A trolley car they hailed 
Went by with clangmg gong 
Before they guessed the comer 
They waited on was wrong. 

And no one told them so 
By way of traveler s aid. 

No one was so far touched 
By the Rogers Group they made. 



ON BEING IDOLIZED 


Tlie wave sucks back and with the last of water 
It wraps a wisp of seaweed round my legs. 

And with the swift rush of its sandy dregs 
So undermines my barefoot stand I totter 
And did I not take steps would be tipped over 
Like the ideal of some mistaken lover. 


[ 552 ] 



A WISH TO COMPLY 


Did I see it go by, 

That Millikan mote? 
Well, I said that I did. 

I made a good try. 

But I’m no one to quote. 
If I have a defect 
It’s a wish to comply 
And see as I’m bid. 

I rather suspect 
All I saw was the lid 
Going over my eye. 

I honestly think 
All I saw was a wink. 


[ 553 ] 



A CLIFF DWELLING 


There sandy seems the golden sky 
And golden seems the sandy plain. 

No habitation meets the eye 
Unless in the horizon rim, 

Some halfway up the limestone wall. 
That spot of black is not a stain 
Or shadow, but a cavern hole. 

Where someone used to climb and crawl 
To rest from his besetting fears. 

I see the callus on his sole 
The disappearing last of him 
And of his race starvation slim. 

Oh, years ago— ten thousand years. 


[ 554 ] 



IT BIDS PRETTY FAIR 


The play seems out for an almost infinite run 

Don’t mind a little thing like the actois fighting 

The only thing I worry about is the sun 

Well be all right if nothing goes wrong with the lighting. 


[ 555 ] 



BEYOND WORDS 


That row of icicles along the gutter 
Feels like my armory of hate; 

And you, you . . . you, you utter . . 
You wait! 


[ 556 ] 



A CASE FOR JEFFERSON 


Harrison loves my country too, 

But wants it all made over new. 

He’s Freudian Viennese by night. 

By day he’s Marxian Muscovite. 

It isn’t because he’s Russian Jew. 

He’s Puritan Yankee through and through. 
He dotes on Saturday pork and beans. 

But his mind is hardly out of his teens 
With him the love of country means 
Blowing it all to smithereens 
And having it all made over new. 


[ 557 ] 



LUCRETIUS VERSUS 1’HE LAKE POETS 

‘Natuie I loved, and next to Natuie, Ait/ 

Dean, adult education may seem silly. 

What of it though? I got some willy-nilly 
The other evening at your college deanery. 

And giateful foi it (Let’s not be facetious!) 

For I thought Epicurus and Lucretius 
By Nature meant the Whole Goddam Machinery. 
But you say that in college nomenclature 
The only meaning possible for Nature 
In Landor’s quatrain would be Pietty Scenery. 
Which makes opposing it to Art absurd 
I grant you— if you’re sure about the woid. 

God bless the Dean and make his deanship plenary.

EDITORIALS 




HAEC FABULA DOCET 


A Blindman by the name of La Fontaine, 

Relying on himself and on his cane. 

Came tap-tap-tapping down the village street, 

The apogee of human blmd conceit. 

Now just ahead of him was seen to yawn 
A trench where water pipes were laying on. 

The Blindman might have found it with his ferrule, 

But someone over anxious at his peril 

Not only warned him with a loud command. 

But ran against him with a staying hand 
Enraged at what he could but thmk officious. 

The Blindman missed him with a blow so vicious 
He gave his own poor iliac a wrench 
And plunged himself head foremost in the trench: 
Where with a glee no less for being grim 
The workmen all turned to and buried him. 

Moral 

The moral is it hardly need be shown, 

All those who try to go it sole alone, 

Too proud to be beholden for rehef. 

Are absolutely sure to come to grief. 


[ 561 ] 



ETHEREALIZING 


A theory if you hold it hard enough 
And long enough gets rated as a creed: 

Such as that flesh is something we can slough 
So that the mind can be entirely freed 
Then when the arms and legs have atrophied, 
And brain is all that’s left of mortal stuff, 

We can lie on the beach with the seaweed 
And take our daily tide baths smooth and rough. 
There once we lay as blobs of jellyfish 
At evolution’s opposite extreme. 

But now as blobs of brain we’ll he and dream. 
With only one vestigial creature wish. 

Oh, may the tide be soon enough at high 
To keep our abstract verse from being dry. 


[ 562 ] 



WHY WAIT FOR SCIENCE 


Sarcastic Science she would like to know, 

In her complacent ministry of fear. 

How we propose to get away from here 
When she has made things so we have to go 
Or be wiped out Will she be asked to show 
Us how by rocket we may hope to steer 
To some star off there say a half light-year 
Through temperature of absolute zer6? 
Why wait for Science to supply the how 
When any amateur can tell it now? 

The way to go away should be the same 
As fifty million years ago we came— 

If anyone lemembers how that was. 

I have a theory, but it hardly does. 


[ 563 ] 



ANY SIZE WE PLEASE 


No one was looking at his lonely case. 

So like a half-mad outpost sentinel. 

Indulging an absurd dramatic spell. 

Albeit not without some shame of face, 

He stretched his arms out to the dark of space 
And held them absolutely parallel 
In infini te appeal. Then saying, ‘Hell’ 

He drew them in for warmth of self-embrace. 

He thought if he could have his space all curved 
Wrapped in around itself and self-befriended. 
His science needn’t get him so unnerved. 

He had been too all out, too much extended. 

He slapped his breast to verify his purse 
And hugged himself for all his universe.

AN IMPORTER 


Mrs Someone’s been to Asia. 

What she brought back would amaze 
Bamboos, ivories, jades, and lacquers, 
Devd-scanng firecrackers, 

Recipes for tea with butter. 

Sacred rigmaroles to mutter, 
Subterfuge for saving faces, 

A developed taste in vases, 

Arguments too stale to mention 
’Gainst American invention, 

Most of all the mass production 
Destined to prove our destruction. 
What are telephones, skyscrapers. 
Safety razors, Sunday papers. 

But the silliest evasion 

Of the truths we owe an Asian? 

But the best of her exhibit 
Was a prayer machine from Tibet 
That by brook power in the garden 
Kept repeating Pardon, pardon; 

And as picturesque machinery 
Beat a sundial in the scenery— 

The most primitive of engines 
Mass producing with a vengeance. 
Teach those Asians mass production? 
Teach your grandmother egg suction.

THE PLANNERS 


If anything should put an end to This, 

I’m think ing the unborn would never miss 

What they had never had of vital bliss 

No burst of nuclear phenomenon 

That put an end to what was going on 

Could make much difference to the dead and gone. 

Only a few of those even in whose day 

It happened would have very much to say. 

And anyone might ask them who were they. 

Who would they be? The guild of social planners 
With the intention blazoned on their banners 
Of get tin g one more chance to change our manners? 
These anyway might think it was important 
That human history should not be shortened. 


[ 566 ] 



NO HOLY WARS FOR THEM 


States strong enough to do good are but few. 
Their number would seem hmited to three. 
Good is a thmg that they the great can do. 
But puny httle states can only be. 

And bemg good for these means standing by 
To watch a war m nominal alliance. 

And when it’s over watch the world’s supply 
Get parceled out among the winning giants. 
God, have you taken cognizance of this? 
And what on this is your divine position? 
That nations hke the Cuban and the Swiss 
Can never hope to wage a Global Mission. 
No Holy Wars for them The most the small 
Can ever give us is a nuisance brawl. 


[ 567 ] 



BURSTING RAPTURE 


I went to the physician to complain, 

The time had been when anyone could turn 
To farming for a simple way to earn, 

But now ’twas there as elsewhere, any g ain 
Was made by getting science on the brain. 
There was so much more every day to learn, 
The discipline of farming was so stem, 

It seemed as if I couldn’t stand the strain. 

But the physician’s answer was ‘There, there. 
What you complam of all the nations share. 
Their effort is a mounting ecstasy 
That when it gets too exquisite to bear 
Will find relief in one burst. You shall see 
That’s what a certain bomb was sent to be.’ 


[ 568 ] 



U. S. 1946 KING’S X 


Having invented a new Holocaust, 

And been the first with it to win a war, 

How they make haste to cry with fingers crossed. 
King's X— no fairs to use it any more! 


[ 569 ] 



THE INGENUITIES OF DEBT 


These I assume were words so deeply meant 
They cut themselves m stone for permanent 
Like trouble m the brow above the eyes. 

‘Take Care to Sell Your Horse before He Dies 
The Art of Life Is Passing Losses on.’ 

The city saying it was Ctesiphon, 

Which may a little while by war and trade 
Have kept from being caught with the decayed. 
Infirm, worn-out, and broken on its hands, 

But judging by what little of it stands, 

Not even the ingenuities of debt 
Could save it from its losses being met 
Sand has been thrusting in the square of door 
Across the tessellation of the floor, 

And only rests, a serpent on its chin. 

Content with contemplating, taking in, 

Till it can muster breath inside a hall 
To rear against the inscription on the wall. 


[ 570 ] 



THE BROKEN DROUGHT 


The prophet of disaster ceased to shout. 
Something was going right outside the hall. 

A rain though stmgy had begun to fall 
That rather hurt his theory of the drought 
And all the great convention was about 
A cheer went up that shook the mottoed wall. 
He did as Shakespeare says, you may recall, 
Good orators will do when they are out. 

Yet in his heart he was unshaken sure 
The drought was one no spit of ram could cure. 
It was the drought of deserts. Earth would soon 
Be uninhabitable as the moon. 

What for that matter had it ever been? 

Who advised man to come and live therein? 


[ 571 ] 



TO THE RIGHT PERSON 


In the one state of ours that is a shire, 
There is a District Schoolhouse I admire 
As much as anything for situation. 

There are few institutions standing higher 
This side the Rockies in my estimation— 
Two thousand feet above the ocean level. 
It has two entries for coeducation. 

But there’s a tight shut look to either door 
And to the windows of its fenestration, 
As if to say mere learning was the devil 
And this school wasn’t keepmg any more 
Unless for penitents who took their seat 
Upon its doorsteps as at mercy’s feet 
To make up for a lack of meditation. 


[ 572 ] 



AN 

AFTERWORD 




TAKE SOMETHING LIKE A STAR 


O Star (the fairest one in sight). 

We grant your loftiness the right 
To some obscurity of cloud— 

It will not do to say of night, 

Since dark is what brings out your light. 
Some mystery becomes the proud. 

But to be wholly taciturn 
In your reserve is not allowed. 

Say something to us we can learn 
By heart and when alone repeat. 

Say something! And it says, 1 bum/ 
But say with what degree of heat. 

Talk Fahrenheit, talk Centigrade. 

Use language we can comprehend. 

Tell us what elements you blend. 

It gives us strangely little aid, 

But does tell something in the end. 

And steadfast as Keats’ Eremite, 

Not even stooping from its sphere, 

It asks a little of us here. 

It asks of us a certain height, 

So when at times the mob is swayed 
To carry praise or blame too far. 

We may take something like a star 
To stay our minds on and be staid. 


[ 575 ] 



CLOSED FOR GOOD 


Much as I own I owe 
The passeis of the past 
Because their to and fro 
Has cut this road to last, 

I owe them more today 
Because they’ve gone away 

And come not back with steed 
And chariot to chide 
My slowness with their speed 
And scare me to one side. 

They have found other scenes 
For haste and other means 

They leave the road to me 
To walk m saying naught 
Perhaps but to a tiee 
Inaudibly in thought, 

‘From you the road receives 
A priming coat of leaves. 

‘And soon for lack of sun. 

The prospects are in white 
It will be further done, 

But with a coat so light 
The shape of leaves will show 
Beneath the brush of snow.’ 

And so on into winter 
Till even I have ceased 
To come as a foot printer, 
[ 576 ] 



And only some slight beast 

So mousy or so foxy 

Shall punt theie as my proxy. 


[ 577 ] 



FROM PLANE TO PLANE 


Neither of them was better than the other. 

They both were hired. And though Pike had the advantage 
Of having hoed and mowed for fifty years, 

Dick had of being fresh and full of college. 

So if they fought about equahty 
It was on an equality they fought. 

‘Your trouble is not sticking to the subject/ 

Pike said with temper. And Dick longed to say, 

‘Your trouble is bucohc lack of logic/ 

But all he did say was, ‘What is the subject?’ 

‘It’s whether these professions really work. 

Now take the Doctor—’ 


They were giving com 
A final gomg over with the hoe 
Before they turned from everything to hay. 

The wavy upflung pennons of the corn 
Were loose all round their legs— you couldn’t say 
How many thousand of them in an acre. 

Every time Dick or Pike looked up, the Doctor 
With one foot on the dashboard of his buggy 
Was still m sight like someone to depend on. 
Nowhere but on the Bradford Interval 
By the Connecticut could anyone 
Have stayed in sight so long as an example. 

‘Taking his own sweet time as if to show 
He don’t mmd havmg lost a case/ Pike said, 

And when he caught Dick looking once too often, 
‘Hoeing’s too much like work for Dick/ he added. 

[ 578 ] 



‘Dick wishes he could swap jobs with the Doctor. 
Let’s holler and ask him if he won’t prescribe 
For all humanity a complete rest 
From all this wagery. But what’s the use 
Of asking any sympathy of him? 

That class of people don’t know what work is— 
More than they know what courage is that claim 
The moral kind’s as brave as facing bullets ’ 

Dick told him to be fairer to the Doctor: 

‘He looks to me like going home successful, 

Full of success, with that foot on the dashboard, 

As a small self-conferred reward of virtue 
I get you when you hoe out to the river, 

Then pick your hoe up, maybe shoulder it, 

And take your walk of recreation back 
To curry favor with the dirt some more. 

Isn’t it pretty much the same idea? 

You said yourself you weren’t avoiding work. 

You’d bet you got more work done m a day, 

Or at least in a lifetime, by that method.’ 

‘I wouldn’t hoe both ways for anybody!’ 

‘And right you are You do the way we do 
In reading, don’t you. Bill?— at every line end 
Pick up our eyes and carry them back idle 
Across the page to where we started from. 

The other way of readmg back and forth, 

Known as boustrophedon, was found too awkward.’ 

Pike grunted rather grimly with misgiving 
At being thus expounded to himself 

[ 579 ] 



And made of by a boy; then having reached 
The river bank, quit work defiantly, 

As if he didn’t care who understood him. 

And started his march back again discoursing. 

‘A man has got to keep his extrication. 

The important thing is not to get bogged down 
In what he has to do to earn a living. 

What’s more, I hate to keep afflicting weeds. 

I like to give my enemies a truce.’ 

Be careful how you use your influence. 

If I decided to become a doctor, 

You’d be to blame for furnishing the reasons ’ 

T thought you meant to be an Indian Chief— 

You said the second coming of Tecumseh. 
Remember how you envied General Sherman 
William Tecumseh Sherman. Why Tecumseh? 

(He tried to imitate Dick’s tone of voice.) 

You wished your middle name had been Tecumseh.’ 

‘I think I’ll change my mind.’ 


‘You’re saying that 

To bother me by siding with the Doctor. 

You’ve got no social conscience as they say, 

Or you’d feel differently about the classes. 

You can’t claim you’re a social visionary.’ 


Tm saying it to argue his idea’s 
The same as your idea, only more so. 

And I suspect it may be more and more so 
The further up the scale of work you go. 

[ 580 ] 



You could do worse than boost me up to see ’ 

It isn’t just the same, and some day, schoolboy, 

I’ll show you why it isn’t— not today 
Today I want to talk about the sun. 

May as expected was a disappomtment. 

And June was not much better, cold and r ain y 
The sun then had his longest day in heaven. 

But no one from the feehng would have guessed 
His presence was particularly there 
He only stayed to set the summer on fire, 

Then fled for fear of getting stuck m lava 
In case the rocks should melt and run again. 

Everyone has to keep his extrication.’ 

‘That’s what the Doctor’s doing, keeping his. 

That’s what I have to do in school, keep mine 
From knowing more than I know how to think with. 
You see it in youiself and in the sun. 

Yet you refuse to see it in the Doctor ’ 

‘All right, let’s harmonize about the Doctor. 

He may be some good in a manner of speaking. 

I own he does look busy when the sun 
Is in the sign of Sickness in the wmter 
And everybody’s being sick for Christmas. 

Then’s when his Morgan lights out throwing snowballs 
Behind her at the dashboard of his pung.’ 

‘But Cygnus isn’t in the Zodiac,’ 

Dick longed to say, but wasn’t sure enough 
Of his astronomy. (He’d have to take 
A half course m it next year.) And besides. 

Why give the controversy a relapse? 

[ 581 ] 



They weie both bent on scuffling up 
Alluvium so pure that when a blade 
To their surprise rang once on stone all day 
Each tried to be the first at getting in 
A superstitious cry for fanners’ luck— 

A rivaliy that made them both feel lander. 

And so to let Pike seem to have the palm 
With grace and not too formal a surrender 
Dick said, Tou’ve been a lesson m woik wisdom 
To work with. Bill. But you won’t have my thanks. 
I like to think the sun’s like you m that— 

Since you bring up the subject of the sun. 

This would be my interpretation of him. 

He bestows summer on us and escapes 

Before our realizing what we have 

To thank him for. He doesn’t want our thanks. 

He likes to turn his back on gratitude 
And avoid being worshiped as a god 
Our worship was a thing he had too much of 
In the old days in Persia and Peru. 

Shall I go on or have I said enough— 

To convey my respect for your position?’ 

T guess so,’ Pike said, innocent of Milton. 

‘That’s where I reckon Santa Claus comes m— 

To be our parents’ pseudonymity 
In Christmas giving, so they can escape 
The thanks and let him catch it as a scapegoat. 
And even he, you’ll notice, dodges off 
Up chimney to avoid the worst of it. 

We all know his address. Mount Hecla, Iceland. 

So anyone can write to him who has to, 

[ 582 ] 



Though they do say he doesn’t open letters. 

A Santa Claus was needed. And there is one ’ 

‘So I have heard and do m pait believe it,’ 
Dick said to old Pike, innocent of Shakespeare.

A MASQUE OF REASON 


A fair oasts in the purest desert . 

A man sits leaning back against a palm , 

His wife lies by him looking at the sky . 

Man You’re not asleep? 

Wife No, I can hear you Why? 

Man I said the incense tree’s on fire again 

Wife You mean the Burning Bush? 

Man The Christmas Tree. 

Wife I shouldn’t be surprised 

Man The strangest light! 

Wife There’s a strange light on everything today. 

Man The myrrh tree gives it. Smell the rosin bum- 
ing? 

The ornaments the Greek artificers 
Made for the Emperor Alexius, 

The Star of Bethlehem, the pomegranates, 

The birds, seem all on fire with Paradise 
And hark, the gold enameled nightingales 
Are singing. Yes, and look, the Tree is troubled. 
Someone’s caught in the branches. 


He can’t get out. 


[ 587 ] 


Wife 


So there is. 



Man 


He’s loose! He’s out! 


Wife It’s God. 

I’d know Him by Blake’s pictuie anywhere. 
Now what’s He domg? 

Man Pitching throne, I guess, 

Here by our atoll. 

Wife Something Byzantine 

(The throne’s a plywood flat, prefabricated, 
That God pulls lightly upright on its hinges 
And stands beside, supporting it in place ) 

Perhaps for an Olympic Tournament, 

Or Court of Love. 

Man More likely Royal Court— 

Or Court of Law, and this is Judgment Day. 

I trust it is. Here’s where I lay aside 

My varying opinion of myself 

And come to rest in an official verdict. 

Suffer yourself to be admired, my love, 

As Waller says. 

Wife Or not admired. Go over 

And speak to Him before the others come. 

Tell Him He may remember you. you’re Job. 

God Oh, I remember well: you’re Job, my Patient. 
How are you now? 1 trust you’re quite recov- 
ered, 

And feel no ill effects from what I gave you. 

[ 588 ] 



Job Gave me in truth. I like the frank admission 
I am a name for bemg put upon 
But, yes, I’m fine, except foi now and then 
A reminiscent twinge of lheumatism. 

The let-up’s heavenly You perhaps will tell us 
If that is all there is to be of Heaven, 

Escape from so great pams of life on earth 
It gives a sense of let-up calculated 
To last a fellow to Eternity 

God Yes, by and by. But first a larger matter. 

I’ve had you on my mmd a thousand years 
To thank you someday for the way you helped 
me 

Estabhsh once for all the principle 
There’s no connection man can reason out 
Between his just deserts and what he gets. 
Virtue may fail and wickedness succeed. 
’Twas a great demonstration we put on. 

I should have spoken sooner had I found 
The word I wanted. You would have supposed 
One who in the beginning was the Word 
Would be in a position to command it. 

I have to wait for words like anyone. 

Too long I’ve owed you this apology 
For the apparently unmeaning sorrow 
You were afflicted with m those old days. 

But it was of the essence of the trial 
You shouldn’t understand it at the time. 

It had to seem unmeaning to have meaning. 
And it came out all right. I have no doubt 
You realize by now the part you played 
[ 589 ] 



To stultify the Deuteionomist 
And change the tenor of lehgious thought 
My thanks are to you for releasing me 
From moral bondage to the human i ace. 

The only free will there at fust was man’s. 
Who could do good or evil as he chose. 

I had no choice but I must follow lum 
With forfeits and rewards he understood— 
Unless I liked to suffer loss of worship. 

I had to prosper good and punish evil. 

You changed all that. You set me free to reign. 
You are the Emancipator of your God, 

And as such I promote you to a saint. 

Job You hear him, Thyatna: we’re a saint. 
Salvation in our case is retroactive 
Were saved, we’re saved, whatever else it 
means. 

Job’s Wife Well, after all these yearsl 

Job This is my wife. 

Job’s Wife If You’re the deity I assume You aie— 

(I’d know You by Blake’s picture anywhere)— 

God The best. I’m told, I ever have had taken. 

Job’s Wife —I have a protest I would lodge with You. 

I want to ask You if it stands to reason 
That women prophets should be burned as 
witches 

Whereas men prophets are received with honor. 

[ 590 ] 



Job Except m their own country, Thyatira. 

God You’re not a witch? 

Job’s Wife No. 

God Have you ever been one? 

Job Sometimes she thinks she has and gets herself 
Worked up about it But she really hasn’t— 
Not m the sense of havmg to my knowledge 
Predicted anything that came to pass. 

Job’s Wife The witch of Endor was a friend of mine 

God You wouldn’t say she fared so very badly. 

I noticed when she called up Samuel 
His spirit had to come. Apparently 
A witch was stronger than a prophet there. 

Job’s Wife But she was burned for witchcraft. 

God That is not 

Of record in my Note Book. 

Job’s Wife Well, she was. 

And I should like to know the reason why. 

God There you go asking for the very thing 
We’ve just agreed I didn’t have to give. 

(The throne collapses. But He picks it up 
And this time locks it up and leaves it.) 
[ 591 ] 



Where has she been the last half hour or so? 
She wants to know why there is still injustice. 
I answer flatly. That’s the way it is, 

And bid my will avouch it like Macbeth. 

We may as well go back to the beginning 
And look for justice m the case of Segub. 

Job Oh, Lord, let’s not go back to anything. 

God Because your wife’s past won’t bear looking 
into? 

In our great moment what did you do. Madam? 
What did you try to make your husband say? 

Job’s Wife No, let’s not live things over. I don’t care. 

I stood by Job. I may have turned on You. 
Job scratched his boils and tried to think what 
he 

Had done or not done to or for the poor. 

The test is always how we treat the poor. 

It’s time the poor weie treated by the state 
In some way not so penal as the poorhouse. 
That’s one thing more to put on Your agenda. 
Job hadn’t done a thing, poor innocent. 

I told him not to scratch, it made it worse. 

If I said once I said a thousand times, 

Don’t scratch! And when, as rotten as his skin, 
His tents blew all to pieces, I picked up 
Enough to build him every night a pup tent 
Around him so it wouldn’t touch and hurt him. 
I did my wifely duty. I should tremble! 

All You can seem to do is lose Your temper 
When reason-hungry mortals ask for reasons. 
[ 592 ] 



Of course, in the abstiact high singular 
There isn’t any univeisal reason, 

And no one but a man would think there was 
You don’t catch women trying to be Plato 
Still there must be lots of unsystematic 
Stray scraps of palliative reason 
It wouldn’t hurt You to vouchsafe the faithful. 
You thought it was agreed You needn’t give 
them 

You thought to suit Yourself. I’ve not agreed 
To anything with anyone. 

Job There, there. 

You go to sleep God must await events 
As well as words 

Job’s Wife I’m serious. God’s had 

Aeons of time and still it’s mostly women 
Get burned for prophecy, men almost never. 

Job God needs time just as much as you or I 

To get thmgs done Reformers fail to see that 
She’ll go to sleep. Nothing keeps her awake 
But physical activity, I find 
Try to read to her and she drops right off. 

God She’s beautiful. 

Job Yes, she was just remarking 

She now felt youngei by a thousand years 
Than the day she was born. 


[ 593 ] 



God That’s about right, 

I should have said You got your age reversed 
When time was found to be a space dimension 
That could, like any space, be turned around 
in? 

Job Yes, both of us. we saw to that at once. 

But, God, I have a question too to raise 
(My wife gets m ahead of me with hers ) 

I need some help about tins reason pioblem 
Before I am too late to be got right 
As to what reasons I agree to waive. 

I’m apt to string along with Thyatua. 

God knows— 01 rather, You know (God forgive 
me) 

I waived the reason for my 01 deal— but— 

I have a question even thei e to ask— 

In confidence. Theie’s no one heie but her, 
And she’s a woman- she’s not interested 
In general ideas and principles. 

God What are her interests, Job? 

Job Witch-women’s rights 

Humor her there or she will be confiimed 
In her suspicion You’ie no feminist 
You have it m for women, she believes 
Kipling invokes You as Lord God of Hosts. 
She’d like to know how You would take a 
prayer 

That started off Lord God of Hostesses. 

God I’m charmed with her. 

[ 594 ] 



Job 


Yes, I could see You were 
But to my question I am much unpiessed 
With what You say we have established 
Between us, You and I 

God I make you see? 

It would be too bad if Columbus-like 
You failed to see the worth of your achieve- 
ment 

Job You call it mine. 

God We groped it out together 

Any onginality it showed 
I give you credit foi. My forte is truth, 

Or metaphysics, long the world’s leproach 
For standing still in one place tiue forever, 
While science goes self-superseding on. 

Look at how far we’ve left the current science 
Of Genesis behind The wisdom there though, 
Is just as good as when I uttered it. 

Still, novelty has doubtless an attraction. 

Job So it’s important who first thinks of things? 

God I’m a great stickler for the author’s name. 

By proper names I find I do my thinking. 

Job’s Wife God, who invented earth? 

Job What, still awake? 

God Any originality it showed 

Was of the Devil. He invented Hell, 

[ 595 ] 



False premises that are the original 
Of all originality, the sin 
That felled the angels, Wolsey should have 
said. 

As for the earth, we groped that out together, 
Much as your husband Job and I together 
Found out the discipline man needed most 
Was to learn his submission to unreason, 

And that for man’s own sake as well as mine, 
So he won’t find it hard to take his orders 
From his mfenors in intelligence 
In peace and war— especially in war. 

Job So he won’t find it hard to take Ins war. 

God You have the idea There’s not much I can tell 
you 

Job All very splendid. I am flattered proud 
To have been in on anything with You. 

’Twas a great demonstration if You say so. 
Though incidentally I sometimes wonder 
Why it had had to be at my expense. 

God It had to be at somebody’s expense. 

Society can never think things out: 

It has to see them acted out by actors, 

Devoted actors at a sacrifice— 

The ablest actors I can lay my hands on. 

Is that your answer? 

Job No, for I have yet 

To ask my question. We disparage reason. 
[ 596 ] 



But all the time it’s what were most concerned 
with. 

There’s will as motor and theie s will as biakes 
Reason is, I suppose, the steeling geai 
The will as brakes can’t stop the will as motor 
For very long. We’re plainly made to go 
We’re going anyway and may as well 
Have some say as to where were headed for. 
Just as we will be talking anyway 
And may as well throw m a little sense. 

Let’s do so now. Because I let You off 
From telling me Your reason, don’t assume 
I thought You had none. Somewhere back 
I knew You had one. But this isn’t it 
You’re giving me. You say we groped this out 
But if You will forgive me the irreverence. 

It sounds to me as if You thought it out. 

And took Your time to it. It seems to me 
An afterthought, a long long afterthought 
I’d give more for one least beforehand reason 
Than all the justifying ex-post-facto 
Excuses trumped up by You for theologists 
The front of bemg answerable to no one 
I’m with You in maintaining to the public. 

But, Lord, we showed them what. The audience 
Has all gone home to bed. The play’s played 
out. 

Come, after all these years-to satisfy me. 

I’m curious. And I’m a grown-up man: 

I’m not a child for You to put me off 
And tantalize me with another 'Oh, because. 
You’d be the last to want me to believe 
All Your effects were merely lucky blunders. 

[ 597 ] 



That would be unbelief and atheism. 

The artist m me cries out for design. 

Such devilish ingenuity of tortuie 
Did seem unlike You, and I tued to think 
The reason might have been some other per- 
son’s. 

But there is nothing You are not behind. 

I did not ask then, but it seems as if 
Now after all these years You might indulge 
me. 

Why did You hurt me so? I am 1 educed 
To asking flatly for the reason— outright. 

God I’d tell you. Job— 

Job All right, don’t tell me then 

If you don’t want to. I don’t want to know 
But what is all this secrecy about? 

I fail to see what fun, what satisfaction 
A God can find in laughing at how badly 
Men fumble at the possibilities 
When left to guess forever for themselves. 

The chances are when there’s so much pretense 

Of metaphysical profundity 

The obscurity’s a fiaud to cover no tiling. 

I’ve come to think no so-called hidden value’s 
Worth gomg aftei. Get down into thmgs 
It will be found there’s no moie given there 
Than on the surface. If there ever was, 

The crypt was long since rifled by the Greeks. 
We don’t know where we are, or who we are. 
We dont know one another; don’t know You; 
[ 598 ] 



Don’t know what time it is We don’t know, 
don’t we? 

Who says we don’t? Who got up these mis- 
givings? 

Oh, we know well enough to go ahead with. 

I mean we seem to know enough to act on. 

It comes down to a doubt about the wisdom 
Of having childien— after having had them, 

So theie is nothing we can do about it 
But warn the children they perhaps should 
have none. 

You could end this by simply coming out 
And saying plainly and unequivocally 
Whether there’s any part of man immortal. 
Yet You don’t speak. Let fools bemuse them- 
selves 

By being baffled for the sake of being 
I’m sick of the whole artificial puzzle 

Job’s Wife You won’t get any answers out of God. 

God My kingdom, what an outbreak! 

Job’s Wife Job is right. 

Your kingdom, yes, Your kingdom come on 
earth. 

Pray tell me what does that mean. Anything? 
Perhaps that earth is going to crack someday 
Like a big egg and hatch a heaven out 
Of all the dead and buried from their graves. 
One simple little statement from the throne 
Would put an end to such fantastic nonsense; 
And, too, take care of twenty of the four 
[ 599 ] 



And twenty freedoms on the party docket. 

Or is it only four? My extra twenty 
Are freedoms from the need of asking ques- 
tions. 

(I hope You know the game called twenty 
questions ) 

For instance, is there such a thing as Pi ogress? 
Job says there’s no such thing as Earth’s be- 
coming 

An easier place for man to save his soul in 
Except as a haid place to save Ins soul in, 

A trial ground where he can try himself 
And find out whether he is any good, 

It would be meaningless It might as well 
Be Heaven at once and have it over with. 

God Two pitching on like this tend to confuse me. 
One at a time, please. I will answer Job first. 
I’m going to tell Job why I toitured him 
And trust it won’t be adding to the torture. 

I was just showing off to the Devil, Job, 

As is set forth in chapters One and Two. 

(Job takes a few steps pacing.) Do you mind? 
( God eyes him anxiously ) 

Job No. No, I mustn’t. 

’Twas human of You. I expected more 
Than I could understand and what I get 
Is almost less than I can understand. 

But I don’t mind. Let’s leave it as it stood. 

The point was it was none of my concern. 

I stick to that. But talk about confusion I 
How is that for a mix-up, Thyatira? 

[ 600 ] 



Yet I suppose what seems to us confusion 
Is not confusion, but the form of forms, 

The serpent’s tail stuck down the serpent’s 
throat, 

Which is the symbol of eternity 

And also of the way all thmgs come round, 

Or of how rays return upon themselves. 

To quote the greatest Western poem yet. 
Though I hold rays deteriorate to nothing. 
First white, then red, then ultra red, then out, 

God Job, you must understand my provocation. 
The tempter comes to me and I am tempted. 
I’d had about enough of his derision 
Of what I valued most in human nature. 

He thinks he’s smart. He thinks he can con- 
vince me 

It is no different with my followers 
From what it is with his Both serve for pay. 
Disinterestedness never did exist 
And if it did, it wouldn’t be a virtue. 

Neither would fairness. You have heard the 
doctrine. 

It’s on the mcrease. He could count on no one- 
That was his look out. I could count on you. 
I wanted him forced to acknowledge so much 
I gave you over to him, but with safeguards. 

I took care of you. And before you died 
I trust I made it clear I took your side 
Against your comfoiters in their contention 
You must be wicked to deserve such pain. 
That’s Browning and sheer Chapel Non-con- 
formism. 


[ 601 ] 



Job God, please, enough for now. I’m m no mood 
For more excuses. 

God What I mean to say: 

Your comforters were wrong. 

Job Oh, that committee! 

God I saw you had no fondness for committees. 

Next time you find yourself pressed on to one 
For the revision of the Book of Prayer 
Put that in if it isn’t m already: 

Dehver us from committees. ’Twill remind me. 
I would do anything for you in reason. 

Job Yes, yes. 

God You don’t seem satisfied. 

Job I am. 

God You’re pensive. 

Job Oh, I’m thinking of the DeviL 

You must remember he was m on this. 

We can’t leave him out. 

God No. No, we don’t need to. 

We’re too well off. 

Job Someday we three should have 

A good old get-together celebration. 

[ 602 ] 



God Why not light now? 

Job We can’t without the Devil. 


God The Devil’s never veiy far away. 

He too is pretty circumambient. 

He has but to appear. He’ll come for me, 
Precipitated from the desert air. 

Show youi self, son. I’ll get back on my throne 
For this T thmk. I find it always best 
To be upon my dignity with him. 

(The Devil cnteis like a sapphire wasp 
That flickers mica wings He lifts a hand 
To brush away a disrespectful smile. 

Job’s wife sits up.) 


Job’s Wife Well, if we aien’t all here. 



Including me, the only Dramatis 

Personae needed to enact the problem. 

Job 

We’ve waked her up. 

Job’s Wife 

I haven’t been asleep 


I’ve heard what you were saying— every word. 

Job 

What did we say? 

Job’s Wife 

You said the Devil’s in it 


She always claims she hasn’t been asleep. 
And what else did we say?

—The Devil’s being God’s best mspnation. 

Good, pretty good. 


Wait till I get my Kodak. 
Would you two please draw m a little closer? 
No— no, that’s not a smile theie That’s a gnn 
Satan, what ails you? Wheie’s the famous 
tongue, 

Thou onetime Prince of Conversationists? 

This is polite society you’re in 
Where good and bad are mingled everywhich- 
way. 

And ears are lent to any sophistry 
Just as if nothing mattered but our manners. 
You look as if you either hoped or feared 
You were more guilty of mischief than you are. 
Nothing has been brought out that for my part 
I’m not prepared for or that Job himself 
Won’t find a formula for taking care of. 

Like the one Milton found to fool liimself 
About his blindness. 

Oh, he speaks I He can speak! 
That strain again! Give me excess of it! 

As dulcet as a pagan temple gong! 

He’s twitting us. Oh, by the way, you haven’t 
By any chance a Lady Apple on you? 

I saw a boxful in the Christmas market. 

How I should prize one personally from you. 
[ 604 ] 



God Don’t you twit. He’s unhappy Church neglect 
And figurative use have pretty well 
Reduced him to a shadow of himself

And easy to see through But where’s he off to? 
I thought theie were to be festivities

Job mentioned him and so I biought him in 
Moie to give his reality its due 
Than anything. 


He’s veiy leal to me 

And always will be Please don’t go. Stay, stay 
But to the evensong and having played 
Together we will go with you along. 

Theie are who won’t have had enough of you 
If you go now Look how he takes no steps! 
He isn’t really going, yet he’s leaving. 

(Who has been standing dazed with new ideas) 
He’s on that tendency that like the Gulf Stream, 
Only ol sand not water, runs through here. 

It has a Kite distinctly different 
Fiom the surrounding deseit, just today 
T stumbled over it and got tripped up. 

Oh, yes, that tendency! Oh, do come off it. 
Don’t let it carry you away. I hate 
A tendency. The minute you get on one 
Tl seems to start right off accelerating.

Here, take my hand. 

(He takes it and alights 
In three quick steps as off an escalator. 
The tendencij, a long, long narrow strip 
Of middle-aisle church carpet, sisal hemp, 
Is worked by hands invisible off stage. ) 

I want you in my group beside the throne— 
Must have you. There, that’s just the right 
arrangement. 

Now someone can light up the Burning Bush 
And turn the gold enameled artificial buds on. 
I recognize them Greek artificers 
Devised them for Alexius Comnenus. 

They won’t show in the picture. That’s too bad 
Neither will I show. That’s too bad moreover 
Now if you three have settled anything 
You’d as well smile as frown on the occasion.

A MASQUE OF MERCY 


Jesse Bel

Keeper 

Jesse Bel 

Paul 

Fugitive 


A bookstore late at flight The Keeper’s wife 
Pulls down the window curtain on the door 
And locks the door. One customer, locked in, 
Stays talking with the Keeper at a show case. 
The Keeper’s wife has hardly turned away 
Before the doors so violently tried 
It makes her move as if to reinforce it 

You can’t come in! (Knock, knock) The store 
is closed! 

Late, late, too late, you cannot enter now. 

We can t be always selling people things. 

He doesn’t go. 


You needn’t be so stem. 
Open enough to find out who it is. 

Keeper, you come and see. Or you come, Paul. 
Our second second-childhood case tonight. 
Where do these senile runaways escape from? 
Wretchedness in a stranger frightens me 
More than it touches me. 


You may come in 

(Entering hatless in a whirl of snow) 

God’s after me! 


You mean the Devil is.

Jesse Bel 



Fugitive No, God. 

Jesse Bel I never heaid of such a thing 


Fugitive Haven’t you heard of Thompson’s Hound of 
Heaven? 

Paul ‘I fled Him, down the nights and down the 
days; 

I fled Him, down the arches of the years ’ 

Keeper This is a bookstore— not a sanctuary. 

Jesse Bel I thought you just now said it was a gift shop 

Keeper Don’t you be bitter about it I’m not bittei 

Fugitive Well, I could use a book 

Keeper What book? 

Fugitive A Bible 

Keeper To find out how to get away fiom God? 

Which is what people use it for too often— 
And why we wouldn’t have one in the store. 
We don’t believe the common man should 
read it. 

Let him seek his religion in the Chuich. 

Jesse Bel Keeper, be still. Pay no attention to him. 

He’s being a religious snob for fun 
The name his mother gave him is to blame 
For Keeper’s levity: My Brothel’s Keepei. 
[ 610 ] 



She didn’t do it to him to be quaint, 

But out of politics. She told me so. 

She was left over from the Brook Farm 
ventuie 

Keeper Why is God after you?— to save your soul? 
Fugitive No, make me prophesy. 

Jesse Bel And— you— just— won’t? 

Fugitive Haven’t you noticed anythmg (hear that!) 
Since I came in? 

Keeper Hear what? That army truck? 

Fugitive Look, I don’t need the Bible to consult 
I just thought if you had a copy handy, 

I could point out my sort of passport m it 
There is a story you may have forgotten 
About a whale. 

Keeper Oh, you mean Moby Dick 

By Rockwell Kent that everybody’s reading 
Trust me to help you find the book you want. 

Jesse Bel Keeper, be still. He knows what book he 
wants. 

He said the Bible. 

Fugitive I should hate to scare you 

With the suspicion at this hour of night 
That I might be a confidence impostor. 

I’m Jonas Dove— if that is any help. 

[ 611 ] 



Paul 

Fugitive 

Paul 

Jonah 

Keeper 

Jonah 

Keeper 


Which is the same as saymg Jonah, Jonah— 
Ah, Jonah, Jonah— twice— repioachfully. 

Spare me the setting of my fate to music. 
How did you know that way to break my 
heart? 

Who are you? 


Who are you? 

I think you know, 

You seem so ready at translating names. 
Unless I’m much mistaken in myself 
This is the seventh time I have been sent 
To prophesy against the city evil. 

What have you got against the city? 

He knows. 

We have enough against it, haven’t we? 
Cursed be the era that congested it. 

Come, come, you talk like an agrarian. 

The city is all right. To live in one 
Is to be civilized, stay up and lead 
Or sing and dance all night and see sunrise 
By waiting up instead of getting up. 

The country’s only useful as a place 
To rest at times from being civilized. 

You take us two, were losers in this store, 

So losers in the city, but were game: 

We don’t go back on grapes we couldn’t reach. 
We blame ourselves. We’re good sports, aren’t 
we, Bel? 


[ 612 ] 



Jesse Bel I’m not a sport and don’t pretend I am one. 
It’s only fair to Keeper to mfoim you 
His favorite reading is seed catalogues 
When he gets too agrarian for me 
I take to drink— at least I take a drink 

(She has her own glass in a vacant chair ) 

Paul She’ll take to drink and see how we like that. 

Keeper Bel is a solitary social dnnkei. 

She doesn’t mmd not offering a drink 
To anyone around when she is drinking. 

Jesse Bel We’ie poor— that’s why. My man can’t earn a 
living 

Keeper Is it just any city you’re against? 

Jonah Yes, but New York will do as an example. 

Keeper Well, you’re as good as in New York this 
minute— 

Or bad as m New York. 

Jonah I know I am. 

That was where my engagement was to speak 
This very night. I had the hall all hired, 

The audience assembled. There I was 
Behind the scenes ordained and advertised 
To prophesy, and full of prophecy. 

Yet could not bring myself to say a word. 

I left light shining on an empty stage 
And fled to you. But you receive me not. 
[ 613 ] 



Keeper Yes, we do, too, with sympathy, my h lend 
Your righteous indignation fizzled out. 

Or else you weie afraid of being mobbed 
If what you had to say was disagieeable 

Jesse Bel Your courage failed. The saddest thing m life 
Is that the best tiling m it should be coinage 
Them is my sentiments, and, Mr. Flood, 

Since you propose it, I believe I will. 

Jonah Please, someone understand. 

Paul 1 undei stand 

Jonah These others don’t. 

Paul You don’t yourself cntiiely 

Jonah What don’t I understand? It’s easy enough. 
I’m in the Bible, all done out m stoiv 
I’ve lost my faith m God to carry out 
The threats He makes against the city evil. 

I can’t trust God to be unmet ciful. 

Keeper You’ve lost your faith in God? How wicked 
of you. 

Jesse Bel You naughty kitten, you shall have no pic. 

Paul Keeper’s the kind of Unitarian 
Who having by elimination got 
From many gods to Three and Thiee to One, 
Thinks why not taper off to none at all, 

[ 614 ] 



Except as father putative to sent of 
Legitimize the biotheihood of man, 

So we can hang together in a stake 

Keeper Now we are heaimg from the Exegete. 

You don’t know Paul, he’s m the Bible too. 
He is the fellow who theologized 
Chiist almost out of Chustiamty. 

Look out for him. 

Paul ‘Look out for me’ is right. 

I’m gomg to tell you something, Jonas Dove. 
I’m going to take the nonsense out of you 
And give you rest, poor Wandering Jew 

Jonah Ini not 

The Wandeiing Jew— I’m who I say I am, 

A prophet with the Bible foi credentials 

Paul I never said you weren’t. I recognized you. 
You are the universal fugitive, 

Escapist as we say, though you aie not 
Running away from Him you think you are 
But from His mercy-justice contradiction. 
Meicy and justice are a contradiction. 

But here’s wheie your evasion has an end. 

I have to tell you sometlnng that will spoil 
Indulgence in your form of melancholy 
Once and for all. I’m going to make you see 
How lelatavely little justice matters. 

Jonah I see what you are up to. robbing me 
Of my incentive — canceling my mission. 

[ 615 ] 



Paul 

I am empoweied to excuse you fiom it 

Jonah 

You! Wlio are you? 1 asked you once befoie. 

Jesse Bel 

He is our analyst 

Jonah 

Your analyst? 

Keeper 

Who keeps our bookstore annals 

Jesse Bel 

Stop it. Keeper. 


An analyst’s the latest thing m doctors 

He’s mine. That’s what he is (you asked)— my 
doctor. 

I’m sick 

Jonah 

Of what? 

Jesse Bel 

Oh, everything, I guess. 


The doctors say the tiouble with me is 

I’m not in love. I didn’t love the doctor 


I had before That’s why I changed to Paul— 
To tty another. 

Paul 

Jesse Bel’s a girl 


Whose cure will he in getting hei idea 

Of the word love corrected. She got off 

To a bad start it seems in the wrong school 
Of therapy. 

Jesse Bel 

I don’t love Paul— as yet. 

Jonah 

How about loving God? 


[616] 



Jesse Bel You make me shrug. 

And I don’t love you either, do I, Keeper? 

Keeper Don’t lay your hand on me to say it, shame- 
less 

Let me alone. 

Jesse Bel I'm sick. Joe’s sick. The world’s sick. 

I’ll take to drmk— at least I’ll take a drink 

Jonah Mv name’s not Joe I don’t like what she says. 
It’s Greenwich Village cocktail party talk— 
Big-city talk I’m getting out of here. 

I’m— bound— away. ( He quotes it to the turn) 

Paul Oh, no, you’re not You’re staying here tonight. 
You locked the door, Bel Let me have the 
key. 

(He goes and takes it from the door himself ) 

Jonah Then I’m a prisoner? 

Paid You are tonight. 

We take it you were sent in here for help. 
And help you’re going to get. 

Jonah I’ll break your door down. 

Always the same when I set out in flight. 

I take the first boat. God puts up a storm 
That someone in the crew connects with me. 
The sailors throw me overboard for luck, 

Or as you might say throw me to the whale— 

[ 617 ] 



For me to disagiee with him and get spit out 
Right back in the same tiouble I was m 
You’re modem, so the whale } on thiow me to 
Will be some soulless lunatic asylum— 

For me to disagree with any science 
Theie may be there and gel spit out again. 

Jesse Bel You poor, poor swallowable little man 

Paul If you would take the hands out of your hair 
And calm vourself Be sane! I heiohv hold 
Your foieaims in the figuie ol a cioss 
The way it lested two points on the giound 
At eveiy station but the final one 

Jonah What good is that? 

Paul I’ll make \ ou see what good. 

Jonah I am sick as she says. Nothing exhausts me 
Like working myself up to piophesv 
And then not prophesying (Hr sifs doini) 

Jesse Bel Can you interpret dreams? I di earned last 
night 

Someone took curved nail scissors and snipped 
off 

My eyelids so I couldn’t shut my eyes 
To anything that happened any moie. 

Jonah She’s had some loss she can’t accept fiom 
God— 


[ 618 ] 



Is that it? Some Utopian belief— 

Oi child, and this is motheily resentment? 

Jesse Bel You look so sleepless. If he’d pionnse us 

To go stiaight home. We wouldn’t keep him, 
would we? 

Wheie aie you staying— anywhere m town? 
Jonah Under the bandstand in Suburban Park. 


Jesse Bel Why, what a stoiy. At this time of year 
There’s not a footprint to it m the snow. 


Paul Jonah, I’m glad, not sad to hear you say 
You can’t trust God to be unmeiciful. 

There you have the beginning of all wisdom 


Keeper One minute, may I, Paul?— befoie we leave 
Religion for these philosophic matters. 

That’s the right style of coat for piophecy 
You’ie sporting there. I’ll bet you’ie good at it. 
Shall it be told we had a piophet captive 
And let him get off without prophesying? 
Let’s have some prophecy. What form of rum 
(For lum I assume was what it was) 

Had you in mind to visit on the city, 
Rebellion, pestilence, invasion? 


Jonah 


Keeper 


Was what I thought of. 


Earthquake 


Have you any grounds, 
Or undergrounds, for confidence in earth- 
quake? 


[ 619 ] 



Jonah It’s good geology— the Funday Fault, 

A fracture m the rocks beneath New York 
That only needs a finger touch from God 
To spring it like a deadfall and the fault 
In nature would wipe out all human fault. 
(He stops to listen ) That’s a mighty storm. 
And we are shaken. But it isn’t earthquake. 
Another possibility I thought of— 

(He stops to listen and his unspoken thought. 
Projected from the lantern of his eyes, 

Is thrown in script as at Belshazzars feast 
On the blank curtain on the outer door) 

—Was Babel: everyone developing 
A language of his own to write his book in. 
And one to cap the climax by combining 
All language in a one-man tongue-confusion. 

(He starts to speak, but stops again to listen. 
The writing on the screen must change too fast 
For any but the rapidest eye readers) 

Suspicion of the income-tax returns, 

A question who was getting the most out 
Of business, might increase into a madness 
The mob might hold a man up in the streets 
And tear his clothes off to examine him 
To find if there were pockets in his skin 
As in a smuggler’s at the diamond fields, 
Where he was hoarding more than they en- 
joyed. 

Paul We can all see what’s passing in your mind 
(I wont have Keeper calling it religion ) 

[ 620 ] 



Its a haicl case. It’s got so prophecy 
Is a disease ol your imagination 
You’ie so lost m the virtuosity 
Of getting up good rums, you’ve forgotten 
Wliat the sms aie men ought to perish for 

Jonah You wioug me. 

Keeper Well then, name a single sm. 

Jonah Anothei possibility I thought of— 

Jesse Bel There he goes off into another trance. 

Keeper You stick to caitliquake, you have something 
thci e— 

Something we’ll know we’re getting when we 
get it. 

Paul ( Taking a walk of down the store distressed ) 
Koepei, I’ll turn on you if you keep on. 

Keeper ff I were in your place though, Mr. Prophet, 
I’d want to he more certain I was called 
Eefoie 1 undertook so delicate 
A mission as to have to tell New York 
Twas in lor an old-fashioned shaking down 
Like the one Joshua gave Jericho. 

You wouldn’t want the night clubs laughing 
at jou.

When was the last time

I’m hearing from Him now, did you but notice. 
Don’t any of you hear a sound? 


The stoim! 

Meiely the windows rattling m the storm 
Trucks going by to war. A wai is on. 

That is no window That’s a show case rattling 
That is your antiques rattling on a shelf. 

You’re doing it. 


I’m not. How could I be? 
You’re doing something to our minds. 


I’m not. 

Don’t you feel something? 

Leave me out of this 
(He leans away in tolerant distaste) 

And heie come all your Great Books tumbling 
down! 

You see the Lord God is a jealous God! 

He wrote one book. Let there be no nioie

How are their volumes fallen! 

[ 622 ]

Only one! 


Jonah Hold on there Leave that open where it lies. 
Be careful not to lose the place. Be careful. 
Please let me have it 

Jesse Bel Read us what it says. 

Jonah Look, will you look! God can’t put words in 
my mouth 

My tongue’s my own as True Thomas used to 
say. 

Keeper So you’ve been Bohning up on Thomism too. 
Jonah Someone else read it. 

Keeper No, you read it to us. 

And if it’s piophecy, we’ll see what happens 

Jonah Nothing would happen. That’s the thing of it. 
God comes on me to doom a city for Him. 
But oh, no, not for Jonah. I refuse 
To be the bearer of an empty threat. 

He may be God, but me. I’m only human. 

I shrink from being publicly let down. 

Jesse Bel Is this the love of God you preached to me? 

Jonah There’s not the least lack of the love of God 
In what I say. Don’t be so silly, woman. 

His very weakness for mankind’s endearing. 

I love and fear Him. Yes, but I fear for Him.

I don’t see how it can be to His interest 
This modern tendency I find m Him 
To take the punishment out of all failure 
To be strong, careful, thufty, diligent, 
Any thin g we once thought we had to be. 

You know what lets us off from being caieful? 
The thing that did what you consider mischief, 
That ushered in this modem lenience 
Was the discovery of fire msuiance. 

The future state is springing even now 
From the discovery that loss fiom failure 
By being spread out over everybody 
Can be made negligible. 


What’s this? 


What’s your book? 


Don’t lose the place. 

Old Dana Lyle 

Who reconciled the Pentateuch with science. 

Where shall I start m? Where my eyes fell

Come on, or we’ll begin to be afraid. 

Well, but remember this is unofficial. 

‘The city’s giotesque iron skeletons 
Would knock their drunken penthouse heads 
together 

And cake their concrete dirt off in the streets.’ 
Then fui tlier down it seems to start from where 
The city is admittedly an evil: 

‘O city on insecure rock pedestal, 

So knowing— and yet needing to be told 
The thought that added cubits to your height 
Would better have been taken to your depth ’ 
(A whole shelf cascades down) Here come 
some more 

The folly crashes and the dust goes up. 

( When the dust settles it should he apparent 
Something has altered in the outer door) 

Mercy, for mercy’s sake I 

Bel wants some mercy 

Kneel to your doctor. He dispenses mercy. 
You’re woikmg it, old man. Don’t be discour- 
aged. 

This isn’t it. I haven’t prophesied. 

This is God at me in my skulking place 
Trying to flush me out. That’s all it is. 

Its nothing but the Lending Library. 

All secondhand. Don’t get excited, folks, 

| 625 ] 



The one indecency’s to make a fuss 
About our own or anybody’s end. 

Jonah It’s nothmg I brought on by words of mine. 

Keeper You know there may have been a small tem- 
blor. 

If so, it will be in tomorrow’s paper 

Paul Now if we’ve had enough of sacrilege. 

We can go back to where we started from 
Let me repeat I’m glad to hear you say 
You can’t trust God to be unmerciful 
What would you have God if not merciful? 

Jonah Just, I would have Him just before all else, 

To see that the fair fight is leally fair. 

Then he could enter on the stricken field 
After the fight’s so definitely done 
There can be no disputing who has won— 
Then he could enter on the stricken field 
As Red Cross Ambulance Commander m Chief 
To ease the more extremely wounded out 
And mend the others up to go ag ain 

Paul I thought as much. You have it all arranged, 
Only to see it shattered every day. 

You should be an authority on Mercy. 

That book of yours in the Old Testament 
Is the first place in literature I think 
Where Mercy is explicitly the subject. 

I say you should be proud of having beaten 
The Gospels to it After doing Justice justice, 
[ 626 ] 



Milton’s pentameters go on to say, 

But Meicy fust and last shall brightest shine. 
Not only last, but first, you will observe, 
Which spoils your figure of the ambulance. 

Keepei Paul only means you make too much of justice. 

There’s some such thing and no one will deny 
lt- 

Enough to bait the trap of the ideal 
From which theie can be no escape for us 
But by our biting off our adolescence 
And leaving it behind us m the trap. 

Jonah Listen, ye' It’s the proletaiiat! 

A 1 evolution’s coming down the street! 

Lights out, 1 say, so’s to escape attention. 

(Hr snaps one bulb off Paul snaps on another) 

Jesse Bel You needn’t shout like that, you wretched 
man. 

Theie’s nothing coming on us, is there, Paul? 
We’ve had about enough of these sensations- 
It’s a coincidence, but we weie on 
The subject of the woikeis’ levolution 
When vou came m. Were revolutionists. 

Or Keepei is a revolutionist. 

Paul almost had jioor Keepei in a comer 
Wheio he would have to quit his politics 
Oi be a Christian. Paul, I wish you’d say 
That over, f shall have to retail it 
To some of Keeper’s friends that come m here, 
A bunch of smalltime revolutionaries. 

[627 j 



Paul makes it come out so they look like 
Christians. 

How they’ll like that. Paul said conservatives— 
You say it, Paul. 


Paul You mean about success. 

And how by its own logic it concentrates 
All wealth and power in too few hands? 

The rich in seeing nothing but injustice 
In their impoverishment by revolution 
Are right. But ’twas intentional injustice. 

It was their justice being mercy-ciossed. 

The revolution Keepers biinging on 
Is nothing but an outbreak of mass mercy. 
Too long pent up in ngorous convention— 

A holy impulse towaids redistubution. 

To set out to homogenize mankind 
So that the cream could never rise again. 
Required someone who laughingly could play 
With the idea of justice in the courts, 

Could mock at riches m the light it claims 
To count on justice to be merely just. 

But we are talking over Jonah’s head, 

Or clear off what we know his interests are 
Still not so far off come to think of it. 

There is some justice even as Keeper says. 
The thing that really counts though is the 
form 

Of outrage— violence— that bleaks across it. 
The very sleep we sleep is an example 
So that because we’re always starting fresh 
The best minds are the best at premises. 
[ 628 ] 



And the most sacred thing of ail’s abruption. 
And if you’ve got to see your justice crossed 
(And you’ve got to) which will you prefer 
To see it, evil-crossed or mercv-ciossed? 

Keeper We poets offer you anothei stai -crossed, 

Of star-crossed, mercy-crossed, or evil-crossed 
I choose the star-crossed as a star-crossed 
lover. 

Jonah I think my trouble’s with the cnsises 

Where mercy-crossed to me seemed evil- 
crossed 

Keeper Good for you, Jonah. That’s what I’ve been 
saymg. 

For instance, when to purify the Itzas 
They took my love and threw her down a well. 

Jesse Bel If it is me in my last incarnation 

He’s thinking of, it wasn’t down a well 
But in a butt of malmsey I was drowned. 

Jonah Why do you call yourself a star-crossed lover? 

Keeper Not everything I say is said in scorn. 

Some people want you not to understand 
them, 

But I want you to understand me wrong. 

Jonah I noticed how he just now made you out 

A revolutionary— which of course you can t be. 

[ 629 ] 



Keeper Or not at least the ordinal y land 

No revolution I bi ought on would aim 
At anything but change of peisonnel 
The Andrew Jackson slogan of Vae Victis 
Or ‘Turn the rascals out’ would do for me 

Paul Don’t you be made feel small by all this posing 
Both of them caught it fiom Bel’s favorite 
poet 

Who m his favorite pose as poet thinker 
(His was the doctune of the Seven Poses) 
Once charged the Nazaiene with having 
brought 

A darkness out of Asia that had ciossed 
Old Attic grace and Spaitan discipline 
With violence The Greeks were hardly 
strangers 

To the idea of violence. It flourished 
Persisting from old Chaos m their myth 
To embroil the very gods about their spheres 
Of influence It’s been a commonplace 
Ever since Alexander Greeced the woild 
’Twere nothing new if that weie all Chust 
brought. 

Christ came to introduce a bieak with logic 
That made all other outrage seem as child’s 
play: 

The Mercy on the Sin against the Sermon 
Strange no one ever thought of it before Him. 
’Twas lovely and its oiigm was love. 

Keeper We know what’s coming now 


[ 630 ] 



Paul 


You say it, Keeper, 
If you have learned youi lesson. Don’t be 
bashful 

Keeper Paul’s constant theme The Sermon on the 
Mount 

Is just a frame-up to insure the failuie 

Of all of us, so all of us will be 

Thrown prostrate at the Mercy Seat for Mercy 

Jesse Bel Yes, Paul, you do say things like that some- 
times 

Paul You all have read the Sermon on the Mount. 
I ask you all to lead it once again 

(They put their hands together like a book 
And hold it up nearsightedly to read ) 

Keeper and 

Jesse Bel We’ie reading it 

Paul Well, now you’ve got it read. 

What do you make of it? 

Jesse Bel The same old nothing 

Keeper A beautiful impossibility. 

Paul Keeper, I’m glad you think it beautiful 

Keeper An n resistible impossibility. 

A lofty beauty no one can live up to 
Yet no one turn fiom trying to live up to. 
[ 631 ] 



Paul Yes, spoken so we can’t live up to it 

Yet so we’ll have to weep because we can’t 

Meicy is only to the undeserving 

But such we all are made m the sight of God. 

‘Oh, what is a king here. 

And what is a booi? 

Here all starve together 
All dwarfed and poor.’ 

Here we all fail together, dwarfed and poor. 
Failure is failure, but success is failure 
There is no better way of having it. 

An end you can’t by any means achieve 
And yet can’t turn your back on or ignore, 
That is the mystery you must accept. 

Do you accept it, Master Jonas Dove? 

Jonah What do you say to it. My Brother’s Keeper? 

Keeper I say I’d rather be lost in the woods 
Than found in church. 

Jonah That doesn’t help me much. 

Keeper Our disagreement when we disagree, Paul, 
Lies in our different approach to Christ, 

Yours more through Home, mine more thiough 
Palestine. 

But let’s be serious about Paul’s offer. 

His irresistible impossibility, 

His lofty beauty no one can live up to 
Yet no one turn away from or ignore— 

I simply turn away from it. 


[ 632 ] 



Paul 


You Pagan! 


Keeper Yes, call me Pagan, Paul, as if you meant it. 
I won’t deceive myself about success 
By making failure out of equal value. 

Any equality they may exhibit’s 
In making fools of people equally. 

Paul But you— what is your answer, Jonas Dove? 

Jonah You ask if I see yonder shining gate. 

And I reply I almost think I do, 

Beyond this great door you have locked 
against me. 

Beyond the storm, beyond the universe. 

Paul Yes, Pilgrim now instead of runaway, 

Your fugitive escape become a quest. 

Keeper Don’t let him make you see too bright a gate 
Or you will come to with a foolish feeling. 
When a great tide of argument sweeps in 
My small fresh water spring gets drowned of 
course. 

But when the brine goes back as go it must 
I can count on my source to spring again 
Not even brackish from its salt experience. 

No true source can be poisoned. 

Jonah Then that’s all. 

You’ve finished. I’m dismissed. I want to run 
Toward what you make me see beyond the 
world. 

Unlock the door for me. 

[ 633 ] 



Keeper 


Not that way out 


Jonah I’m all turned round. 

Paul Theie is youi way prepared 

Jonah That’s not my door. 

Keeper No, that’s another door 

Your exit door’s become a cellai dooi. 

(The door here opens darkhj of ilsclf) 

Jonah You mean I’m being sent down m the cellar' 1 

Paul You must make your descent like everyone. 

Keeper Go if you’re going. 

Jonah Who is sending me 11 

Whose cellar is it, youis 01 the apostle’s? 

Keeper It is the cellar to my store Wluil ho, down 
there! 

My dungeoneers, come fetch us.— No one 
answers. 

There’s not much we can do till Martin gets 
here.— 

Don’t let me scare you. I was only teasing 
It is the cellar to my store., but not my cellai 
Jesse has given Paul the lent of it 
To base his campaign on to save the woild. 
[ 634 ] 



Jesse Bel Something’s the matter eveiyone admits. 

On the off-chance it may be lack of faith 
I have contributed the empty cellar 
To Paul to see what he can do with it 
To bring faith back I’m only languidly 
Inclined to hope for much. Still what we need 
Is something to believe in, don’t we, Paul? 

Keeper By something to believe in Jesse means 
Sometlnng to be fanatical about 
So as to justify the orthodox 
In saving heretics by slaying them, 

Not on the battlefield, but down in cellars. 
That way’s been tried too many times for me. 
I’d like to see the world tried once without it. 

Jesse Bel The world seems crying out for a Messiah. 

Keeper Haven’t you heard the news ' 5 We already have 
one, 

And of the Messianic race, Karl Marx. 

Jesse Bel Light, brmg a light! 

Keeper Awh, there’s no lack of light, you— 

A light that falls diffused over my shoulder 
And is reflected from the printed page 
And bed of world-flowers so as not to blind 
me. 

If even the face of man’s too bright a light 
To look at long directly (like the sun), 

Then how much more the face of truth must 
be. 


[ 635 ] 



We were not given eyes or intellect 
For all the light at once the source of light — 
For wisdom that can have no counterwisdom. 
In our subscription to the sentiment 
Of one God we provide He shall be one 
Who can be many Gods to many men, 

His church on earth a Roman Pantheon, 
Which is our greatest hope of rest from war 
Live and let live, believe and let believe 
’Twas said the lesser gods were only traits 
Of the one awful God. Just so the saints 
Are God’s white light refracted into colors. 

Jesse Bel Let’s change the subject, boys, I’m getting 
nervous. 

Keeper Nervous is all the great things ever made you. 

But to repeat and get it thiough your head: 
We have all the belief that’s good for us. 

Too much all-fired behef and we’d be back 
Down burning skeptics m the cellar furnace 
Like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 

Jonah What’s all this talk of slaying down in cellars— 
So sinister? You spoke to someone down there. 

Keeper My friends and stokeis, JefTeis and O’Neill 
They fail me. Now I’m teasing you again. 
There’s no one down there getting tortured 
save 

A penitent perhaps self-llnown on Mercy. 

Jonah I heard a deep groan— maybe out of him. 
What’s really down there? 

[ 636 ] 



Paul Just an oubliette, 

Where you must he m self-forgetfulness 
On the wet flags befoie a ciucifix 
I have had painted on the cellar wall 
By a religious Aztec Indian. 

Jonah Then it’s not lethal— to get nd of me? 

Have they been down? 

Paul Not in the proper spirit. 

These two are stubborn children as you see. 
Their case is not so simple. You are good. 

Jonah I am your convert Tell me what I think 

My trouble has been with my sense of justice. 
And you say justice doesn’t leally matter 

Paul Does it to you as greatly as it did? 

Jonah I own the need of it had somewhat faded 
Even before I came m here tonight 

Paul Well then! 

Jonah And that’s what I’m to meditate? 

Paul Meditate nothing. Learn to contemplate. 
Contemplate glory. There will be a light. 
Contemplate Truth until it bums your eyes 
out. 

I don’t see any staircase. 

[ 637 ] 


Jonah 



Keeper 


Thei e aie staus. 


Paul Some lingering obiection holds you back 

Jonah If what you say is tiue, if winning uinks 
The same with God as losing, how explain 
Our making all this effoit mortals make? 

Keeper Good for you, Jonah That’s what I’ve been 
saying 

Jonah You’ll tell me sometime All you say has gieat- 
ness 

Yet your fnend heie can’t be quite disie- 
garded. 

Keeper I say we keep linn till we wring some moie 
Naiveness about Justice out of him. 

As once the Pharaoh did it out of Sekhti 
By having him whipped eveiv day alicsh 
For clamoring for justice at the gate 
Until the scribes had taken down a bookful 
For distribution to his buieauciats. 

Jonah I’m going now. But don’t you push me off. 

Keeper I was supporting you for feai you’d famt 

From disillusionment. You’ve had to take it. 

(Jonah steps on the threshold as the door 
Slams in his face. The blow and the repulse 
Crumple him on the floor. Keeper and Paul 
Kneel by him. Bel stands up beside her chair 
As if to come , but Keeper waves her off) 
[ 638 ] 



Jonah I think I may have got God wrong entirely. 

Keeper All of us get each other pretty wrong. 

Jesse Bel Now we have done it, Paul What did he say? 

Jonah I should have warned you, though my sense 
of justice 

Was about all there ever was to me. 

When that fades I fade— every time I fade 
Mercy on me for having thought I knew. 

Jesse Bel What did he say? I can’t hear what he says 

Paul Mercy on him for having asked for justice. 

Keeper Die saying that, old-fashioned sapient. 

You poor old sape, if I may com the slang. 
We like you, don’t we, Paul? ( Paul takes his 

wrist) 

Jesse Bel ( Still standing off) We’ve all grown fond of 
you. 

Paul We’ve all grown fond of you. ( Paul says it 

louder, 

But Jonah gives no sign of having heard ) 

Keeper Who said too late you cannot enter now? 

Jesse Bel He was rejected for his reservations! 

Keeper ( Still on his knees he sits back on his heels) 

But one thing more before the curtain falls. 
[ 639 ] 



(The curtain starts to fall) Please hold the 
Curtain- 

All Paul means, and I wish the dead could 
hear me. 

All you mean, Paul, I think— 

se Bel Will you stand theie 

And let that tell you what you think like that 0 

Paul Suffer a fnend to try to word you better. 

se Bel Oh, theie’s to be a funeral oration. 

And were an orator. Get up. Stand up 
For what you think your doctor thinks, why 
don’t you? 

Don’t wear your pants out pieachmg on your 
knees. 

Save them to say your prayers on.— What’s 
the matter? 

leeper (He doesn’t rise, but looks at her a moment) 
Lady, at such a time, and in the Presence! 

I won’t presume to tell Bel where to go 
But if this prophet s mantle fell on me 
I should dare say she would be taken care of. 
We send our wicked enemies to Hell, 

Our wicked friends we send to Purgatory. 
But Bel gets some things right— and she was 
right— 

(She startles at the sudden note of kindness ) 

I am right then? 

[ 640 ] 


e Bel 



Keeper 


In glorifying courage. 
Courage is of the heart by derivation, 

And gieat it is But fear is of the soul. 

And I’m afraid ( The bulb lights sicken down. 
The cellar door swings wide and slams again) 

Paul The fear that you’re afraid with is the fear 
Of God’s decision lastly on your deeds. 

That is the Fear of God whereof ’tis written 

Keeper But not the fear of punishment for sin 
(I have to sin to prove it isn’t that). 

I’m 110 more governed by the fear of Hell 
Than by the fear of the asylum, jail, or poor- 
house. 

The basic three the state is founded on. 

But I’m too much afraid of God to claim 
I have been fighting on the angels’ side. 

That is for Him and not for me to say 
For me to say it would be irreligious. 
(Sometimes I think you are too sure you have 
been.) 

And I can see that the uncertainty 
In which we act is a seveiity, 

A cruelty, amounting to injustice 

That nothing but God’s mercy can assuage. 

I can sec that, if that is what you mean. 

Give me a hand up, if we are agreed 

Paul Yes, there you have it at the root of things. 
We have to stay afraid deep in our souls 
Our sacrifice, the best we have to offer, 

And not our worst nor second best, our best, 

[ 641 ] 



Our very best, our lives laid down like Jonah’s, 
Our lives laid down m war and peace, may not 
Be found acceptable in Heaven’s sight 
And that they may be is the only prayer 
Worth praying May my saciifice 
Be found acceptable in Heaven’s sight 

Keeper Let the lost millions pray it in the dark! 

My failure is no diffeient from Jonah’s. 

We both have lacked the couiage in the heart 
To overcome the fear withni the soul 
And go ahead to any accomplishment. 
Courage is what it takes and takes the more of 
Because the deeper fear is so eternal. 

And if I say we lift him from the floor 
And lay him where you ordered him to lie 
Before the cross, it is from fellow feeling. 

As if I asked for one more chance myself 
To learn to say (He mooes to Jonah’s feet ) 
Nothing can make injustice just but mercy
