waltwhitman,I
waltwhitman,POEMS OF WAR
waltwhitman,THICK-SPRINKLED BUNTING
waltwhitman,Thick-sprinkled bunting! flag of stars!
waltwhitman,"Long yet your road, fateful flag--long yet your road, and lined with"
waltwhitman,"bloody death,"
waltwhitman,"For the prize I see at issue at last is the world,"
waltwhitman,All its ships and shores I see interwoven with your threads greedy
waltwhitman,banner;
waltwhitman,"Dream'd again the flags of kings, highest borne, to flaunt unrival'd?"
waltwhitman,"O hasten flag of man--O with sure and steady step, passing highest"
waltwhitman,"flags of kings,"
waltwhitman,"Walk supreme to the heavens mighty symbol--run up above them all,"
waltwhitman,Flag of stars! thick-sprinkled bunting!
waltwhitman,BEAT! BEAT! DRUMS!
waltwhitman,Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!
waltwhitman,"Through the windows--through doors--burst like a ruthless force,"
waltwhitman,"Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,"
waltwhitman,Into the school where the scholar is studying;
waltwhitman,Leave not the bridegroom quiet--no happiness must he have now with his
waltwhitman,"bride,"
waltwhitman,"Not the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his"
waltwhitman,"grain,"
waltwhitman,So fierce you whirr and pound you drums--so shrill you bugles blow.
waltwhitman,Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!
waltwhitman,Over the traffic of cities--over the rumble of wheels in the streets;
waltwhitman,Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must
waltwhitman,"sleep in those beds,"
waltwhitman,No bargainers' bargains by day--no brokers or speculators--would they
waltwhitman,continue?
waltwhitman,Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?
waltwhitman,Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?
waltwhitman,"Then rattle quicker, heavier drums--you bugles wilder blow."
waltwhitman,Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!
waltwhitman,"Make no parley--stop for no expostulation,"
waltwhitman,"Mind not the timid--mind not the weeper or prayer,"
waltwhitman,"Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,"
waltwhitman,"Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties,"
waltwhitman,Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the
waltwhitman,"hearses,"
waltwhitman,So strong you thump O terrible drums--so loud you bugles blow.
waltwhitman,CITY OF SHIPS
waltwhitman,City of ships!
waltwhitman,(O the black ships! O the fierce ships!
waltwhitman,O the beautiful sharp-bow'd steam-ships and sail-ships!)
waltwhitman,"City of the world! (for all races are here,"
waltwhitman,All the lands of the earth make contributions here);
waltwhitman,City of the sea! city of hurried and glittering tides!
waltwhitman,"City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling in and"
waltwhitman,out with eddies and foam!
waltwhitman,City of wharves and stores--city of tall façades of marble and iron!
waltwhitman,"Proud and passionate city--mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!"
waltwhitman,"Spring up O city--not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself, warlike!"
waltwhitman,"Fear not--submit to no models but your own, O city!"
waltwhitman,Behold me--incarnate me as I have incarnated you!
waltwhitman,I have rejected nothing you offer'd me--whom you adopted I have
waltwhitman,"adopted,"
waltwhitman,Good or bad I never question you--I love all--I do not condemn
waltwhitman,"anything,"
waltwhitman,"I chant and celebrate all that is yours--yet peace no more,"
waltwhitman,"In peace I chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine,"
waltwhitman,"War, red war is my song through your streets, O city!"
waltwhitman,"A MARCH IN THE RANKS HARD-PREST, AND THE ROAD UNKNOWN"
waltwhitman,"A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,"
waltwhitman,"A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,"
waltwhitman,"Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,"
waltwhitman,Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted
waltwhitman,"building,"
waltwhitman,"We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted"
waltwhitman,"building,"
waltwhitman,"'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu"
waltwhitman,"hospital,"
waltwhitman,Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and
waltwhitman,"poems ever made,"
waltwhitman,"Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and"
waltwhitman,"lamps,"
waltwhitman,And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and
waltwhitman,"clouds of smoke,"
waltwhitman,"By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some"
waltwhitman,"in the pews laid down,"
waltwhitman,"At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of"
waltwhitman,"bleeding to death (he is shot in the abdomen),"
waltwhitman,I stanch the blood temporarily (the youngster's face is white as a
waltwhitman,"lily),"
waltwhitman,Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb
waltwhitman,"it all,"
waltwhitman,"Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,"
waltwhitman,"some of them dead,"
waltwhitman,"Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, the"
waltwhitman,"odour of blood,"
waltwhitman,"The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also"
waltwhitman,"fill'd,"
waltwhitman,"Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the"
waltwhitman,"death-spasm sweating,"
waltwhitman,"An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,"
waltwhitman,The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the
waltwhitman,"torches,"
waltwhitman,"These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odour,"
waltwhitman,"Then hear outside the orders given, _Fall in, my men, fall in_;"
waltwhitman,"But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives"
waltwhitman,"he me,"
waltwhitman,"Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,"
waltwhitman,"Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,"
waltwhitman,The unknown road still marching.
waltwhitman,COME UP FROM THE FIELDS FATHER
waltwhitman,"Come up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete,"
waltwhitman,"And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy dear son."
waltwhitman,"Lo, 'tis autumn,"
waltwhitman,"Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,"
waltwhitman,Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate
waltwhitman,"wind,"
waltwhitman,Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd
waltwhitman,vines
waltwhitman,(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?
waltwhitman,"Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?),"
waltwhitman,"Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with"
waltwhitman,"wondrous clouds,"
waltwhitman,"Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers"
waltwhitman,well.
waltwhitman,"Down in the fields all prospers well,"
waltwhitman,"But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's call,"
waltwhitman,"And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away."
waltwhitman,"Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,"
waltwhitman,She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.
waltwhitman,"Open the envelope quickly,"
waltwhitman,"O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,"
waltwhitman,"O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's soul!"
waltwhitman,"All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main"
waltwhitman,"words only,"
waltwhitman,"Sentences broken, _gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken"
waltwhitman,"to hospital,"
waltwhitman,"At present low, but will soon be better._"
waltwhitman,"Ah now the single figure to me,"
waltwhitman,"Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,"
waltwhitman,"Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,"
waltwhitman,By the jamb of a door leans.
waltwhitman,"_Grieve not so, dear mother_ (the just-grown daughter speaks through"
waltwhitman,"her sobs,"
waltwhitman,"The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd),"
waltwhitman,"_See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better._"
waltwhitman,"Alas poor boy, he will never be better (nor may be needs to be"
waltwhitman,"better, that brave and simple soul),"
waltwhitman,"While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,"
waltwhitman,The only son is dead.
waltwhitman,"But the mother needs to be better,"
waltwhitman,"She with thin form presently drest in black,"
waltwhitman,"By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping, often"
waltwhitman,"waking,"
waltwhitman,"In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,"
waltwhitman,"O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and"
waltwhitman,"withdraw,"
waltwhitman,"To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son."
waltwhitman,A TWILIGHT SONG
waltwhitman,"As I sit in twilight late alone by the flickering oak-flame,"
waltwhitman,Musing on long-pass'd war-scenes--of the countless buried unknown
waltwhitman,"soldiers,"
waltwhitman,"Of the vacant names, as unindented air's and sea's--the unreturn'd,"
waltwhitman,"The brief truce after battle, with grim burial-squads, and the"
waltwhitman,deep-fill'd trenches
waltwhitman,"Of gather'd dead from all America, North, South, East, West, whence"
waltwhitman,"they came up,"
waltwhitman,"From wooded Maine, New-England's farms, from fertile Pennsylvania,"
waltwhitman,"Illinois, Ohio,"
waltwhitman,"From the measureless West, Virginia, the South, the Carolinas, Texas"
waltwhitman,(Even here in my room-shadows and half-lights in the noiseless
waltwhitman,"flickering flames,"
waltwhitman,"Again I see the stalwart ranks on-filing, rising--I hear the rhythmic"
waltwhitman,tramp of the armies);
waltwhitman,"You million unwrit names all, all--you dark bequest from all the war,"
waltwhitman,A special verse for you--a flash of duty long neglected--your mystic
waltwhitman,"roll strangely gather'd here,"
waltwhitman,"Each name recall'd by me from out the darkness and death's ashes,"
waltwhitman,"Henceforth to be, deep, deep within my heart recording, for many a"
waltwhitman,"future year,"
waltwhitman,"Your mystic roll entire of unknown names, or North or South,"
waltwhitman,Embalm'd with love in this twilight song.
waltwhitman,A SIGHT IN CAMP IN THE DAYBREAK GRAY AND DIM
waltwhitman,"A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,"
waltwhitman,"As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,"
waltwhitman,As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital
waltwhitman,"tent,"
waltwhitman,"Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended"
waltwhitman,"lying,"
waltwhitman,"Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,"
waltwhitman,"Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all."
waltwhitman,"Curious I halt and silent stand,"
waltwhitman,Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first
waltwhitman,just lift the blanket;
waltwhitman,"Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray'd hair,"
waltwhitman,and flesh all sunken about the eyes?
waltwhitman,Who are you my dear comrade?
waltwhitman,Then to the second I step--and who are you my child and darling?
waltwhitman,Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?
waltwhitman,"Then to the third--a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of beautiful"
waltwhitman,yellow-white ivory;
waltwhitman,Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the
waltwhitman,"Christ himself,"
waltwhitman,"Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies."
waltwhitman,YEAR THAT TREMBLED AND REEL'D BENEATH ME
waltwhitman,Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me!
waltwhitman,"Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed froze me,"
waltwhitman,"A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me,"
waltwhitman,"Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself,"
waltwhitman,"Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled,"
waltwhitman,And sullen hymns of defeat?
waltwhitman,FIRST O SONGS FOR A PRELUDE
waltwhitman,"First O songs for a prelude,"
waltwhitman,"Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in my city,"
waltwhitman,"How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,"
waltwhitman,"How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,"
waltwhitman,"(O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless."
waltwhitman,"O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than steel!)"
waltwhitman,How you sprang--how you threw off the costumes of peace with
waltwhitman,"indifferent hand,"
waltwhitman,"How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard in"
waltwhitman,"their stead,"
waltwhitman,"How you led to the war (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of"
waltwhitman,"soldiers),"
waltwhitman,How Manhattan drum-taps led.
waltwhitman,"Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,"
waltwhitman,"Forty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this teeming and"
waltwhitman,"turbulent city,"
waltwhitman,"Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,"
waltwhitman,"With her million children around her, suddenly,"
waltwhitman,"At dead of night, at news from the south,"
waltwhitman,Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.
waltwhitman,"A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,"
waltwhitman,Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its myriads.
waltwhitman,"From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,"
waltwhitman,"Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming."
waltwhitman,"To the drum-taps prompt,"
waltwhitman,"The young men falling in and arming,"
waltwhitman,"The mechanics arming (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's"
waltwhitman,"hammer, tost aside with precipitation),"
waltwhitman,"The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the court,"
waltwhitman,"The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing"
waltwhitman,"the reins abruptly down on the horses' backs,"
waltwhitman,"The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper, porter, all"
waltwhitman,leaving;
waltwhitman,"Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,"
waltwhitman,"The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear their"
waltwhitman,"accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,"
waltwhitman,"Outdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musket-barrels,"
waltwhitman,"The white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around, the"
waltwhitman,"sunrise cannon and again at sunset,"
waltwhitman,"Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark"
waltwhitman,from the wharves
waltwhitman,"(How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with their"
waltwhitman,guns on their shoulders!
waltwhitman,"How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and their"
waltwhitman,clothes and knapsacks cover'd with dust!)
waltwhitman,"The blood of the city up--arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,"
waltwhitman,The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the
waltwhitman,"public buildings and stores,"
waltwhitman,"The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his"
waltwhitman,mother
waltwhitman,"(Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain"
waltwhitman,"him),"
waltwhitman,"The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing"
waltwhitman,"the way,"
waltwhitman,"The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their"
waltwhitman,"favourites,"
waltwhitman,"The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along, rumble"
waltwhitman,lightly over the stones
waltwhitman,"(Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,"
waltwhitman,Soon unlimber'd to begin the red business);
waltwhitman,"All the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,"
waltwhitman,"The hospital service, the lint, bandages, and medicines,"
waltwhitman,"The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no"
waltwhitman,mere parade now;
waltwhitman,"War! an arm'd race is advancing, the welcome for battle, no turning"
waltwhitman,away;
waltwhitman,"War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing to"
waltwhitman,welcome it.
waltwhitman,Mannahatta a-march--and it's O to sing it well!
waltwhitman,It's O for a manly life in the camp.
waltwhitman,And the sturdy artillery
waltwhitman,"The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,"
waltwhitman,Unlimber them! (No more as the past forty years for salutes for
waltwhitman,"courtesies merely,"
waltwhitman,Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)
waltwhitman,"And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,"
waltwhitman,"Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,"
waltwhitman,Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd amid all
waltwhitman,"your children,"
waltwhitman,But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.
waltwhitman,SONG OF THE BANNER AT DAYBREAK
waltwhitman,_Poet_
waltwhitman,"O a new song, a free song,"
waltwhitman,"Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,"
waltwhitman,"By the wind's voice and that of the drum,"
waltwhitman,By the banner's voice and the child's voice and sea's voice and
waltwhitman,"father's voice,"
waltwhitman,"Low on the ground and high in the air,"
waltwhitman,"On the ground where father and child stand,"
waltwhitman,"In the upward air where their eyes turn,"
waltwhitman,Where the banner at daybreak is flapping.
waltwhitman,Words! book-words! what are you?
waltwhitman,"Words no more, for hearken and see,"
waltwhitman,"My song is there in the open air, and I must sing,"
waltwhitman,With the banner and pennant a-flapping.
waltwhitman,"I'll weave the chord and twine in,"
waltwhitman,"Man's desire and babe's desire, I'll twine them in, I'll put in life,"
waltwhitman,"I'll put the bayonet's flashing point, I'll let bullets and slugs whizz"
waltwhitman,"(As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the future,"
waltwhitman,"Crying with trumpet voice, _Arouse and beware! Beware and arouse!_)"
waltwhitman,"I'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of"
waltwhitman,"joy,"
waltwhitman,"Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,"
waltwhitman,With the banner and pennant a-flapping.
waltwhitman,_Pennant_
waltwhitman,"Come up here, bard, bard,"
waltwhitman,"Come up here, soul, soul,"
waltwhitman,"Come up here, dear little child,"
waltwhitman,"To fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the measureless"
waltwhitman,light.
waltwhitman,_Child_
waltwhitman,Father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?
waltwhitman,And what does it say to me all the while?
waltwhitman,_Father_
waltwhitman,"Nothing my babe you see in the sky,"
waltwhitman,"And nothing at all to you it says--but look you my babe,"
waltwhitman,"Look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the"
waltwhitman,"money-shops opening,"
waltwhitman,And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with
waltwhitman,goods;
waltwhitman,"These, ah these, how valued and toil'd for these!"
waltwhitman,How envied by all the earth!
waltwhitman,_Poet_
waltwhitman,"Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high,"
waltwhitman,"On floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels,"
waltwhitman,"On floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward land,"
waltwhitman,The great steady wind from west to west-by-south.
waltwhitman,Floating so buoyant with milk-white foam on the waters.
waltwhitman,"But I am not the sea nor the red sun,"
waltwhitman,"I am not the wind with girlish laughter,"
waltwhitman,"Not the immense wind which strengthens, not the wind which lashes,"
waltwhitman,"Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death,"
waltwhitman,"But I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,"
waltwhitman,"Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,"
waltwhitman,"Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings,"
waltwhitman,"And the shore-sands know and the hissing wave, and that banner and"
waltwhitman,"pennant,"
waltwhitman,Aloft there flapping and flapping.
waltwhitman,_Child_
waltwhitman,"O father it is alive--it is full of people--it has children,"
waltwhitman,"O now it seems to me it is talking to its children,"
waltwhitman,I hear it--it talks to me--O it is wonderful!
waltwhitman,"O it stretches--it spreads and runs so fast--O my father,"
waltwhitman,It is so broad it covers the whole sky.
waltwhitman,_Father_
waltwhitman,"Cease, cease, my foolish babe,"
waltwhitman,"What you are saying is sorrowful to me, much it displeases me;"
waltwhitman,"Behold with the rest again I say, behold not banners and pennants"
waltwhitman,"aloft,"
waltwhitman,"But the well-prepared pavements behold, and mark the solid-wall'd"
waltwhitman,houses.
waltwhitman,_Banner and Pennant_
waltwhitman,"Speak to the child O bard out of Manhattan,"
waltwhitman,"To our children all, or north or south of Manhattan,"
waltwhitman,"Point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all--and yet we"
waltwhitman,"know not why,"
waltwhitman,"For what are we, mere strips of cloth profiting nothing,"
waltwhitman,Only flapping in the wind?
waltwhitman,_Poet_
waltwhitman,"I hear and see not strips of cloth alone,"
waltwhitman,"I hear the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry,"
waltwhitman,"I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men, I hear Liberty!"
waltwhitman,"I hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing,"
waltwhitman,"I myself move abroad swift-rising flying then,"
waltwhitman,"I use the wings of the land-bird and use the wings of the sea-bird, and"
waltwhitman,"look down as from a height,"
waltwhitman,"I do not deny the precious results of peace, I see populous cities with"
waltwhitman,"wealth incalculable,"
waltwhitman,"I see numberless farms, I see the farmers working in their fields or"
waltwhitman,"barns,"
waltwhitman,"I see mechanics working, I see buildings everywhere founded, going"
waltwhitman,"up, or finish'd,"
waltwhitman,I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks drawn by
waltwhitman,"the locomotives,"
waltwhitman,"I see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston, New"
waltwhitman,"Orleans,"
waltwhitman,"I see far in the West the immense area of grain, I dwell awhile"
waltwhitman,"hovering,"
waltwhitman,"I pass to the lumber forests of the North, and again to the Southern"
waltwhitman,"plantation, and again to California;"
waltwhitman,"Sweeping the whole I see the countless profit, the busy gatherings,"
waltwhitman,"earn'd wages,"
waltwhitman,See the Identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and haughty States
waltwhitman,"(and many more to come),"
waltwhitman,"See forts on the shores of harbours, see ships sailing in and out;"
waltwhitman,Then over all (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen'd pennant shaped
waltwhitman,"like a sword,"
waltwhitman,Runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance--and now the halyards have
waltwhitman,"rais'd it,"
waltwhitman,"Side of my banner broad and blue, side of my starry banner,"
waltwhitman,Discarding peace over all the sea and land.
waltwhitman,_Banner and Pennant_
waltwhitman,"Yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!"
waltwhitman,"No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone,"
waltwhitman,"We may be terror and carnage, and are so now,"
waltwhitman,Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States (nor any
waltwhitman,"five, nor ten),"
waltwhitman,"Nor market nor depot we, nor money-bank in the city,"
waltwhitman,"But these and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines"
waltwhitman,"below, are ours,"
waltwhitman,"And the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and small,"
waltwhitman,"And the fields they moisten, and the crops and the fruits are ours,"
waltwhitman,Bays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ours--while we
waltwhitman,"over all,"
waltwhitman,"Over the area spread below, the three or four millions of square"
waltwhitman,"miles, the capitals,"
waltwhitman,"The forty millions of people--O bard! in life and death supreme,"
waltwhitman,"We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,"
waltwhitman,"Not for the present alone, for a thousand years chanting through you,"
waltwhitman,This song to the soul of one poor little child.
waltwhitman,_Child_
waltwhitman,"O my father I like not the houses,"
waltwhitman,"They will never to me be anything, nor do I like money,"
waltwhitman,"But to mount up there I would like, O father dear, that banner I like,"
waltwhitman,That pennant I would be and must be.
waltwhitman,_Father_
waltwhitman,"Child of mine you fill me with anguish,"
waltwhitman,"To be that pennant would be too fearful,"
waltwhitman,"Little you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever,"
waltwhitman,"It is to gain nothing, but risk and defy everything,"
waltwhitman,"Forward to stand in front of wars--and O, such wars!--what have you"
waltwhitman,to do with them?
waltwhitman,"With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?"
waltwhitman,_Banner_
waltwhitman,"Demons and death then I sing,"
waltwhitman,"Put in all, aye all will I, sword-shaped pennant for war,"
waltwhitman,"And a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of children,"
waltwhitman,Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid wash of
waltwhitman,"the sea,"
waltwhitman,"And the black ships fighting on the sea envelop'd in smoke,"
waltwhitman,"And the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and pines,"
waltwhitman,"And the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching, and the"
waltwhitman,"hot sun shining south,"
waltwhitman,"And the beach-waves combing over the beach on my Eastern shore, and my"
waltwhitman,"Western shore the same,"
waltwhitman,"And all between those shores, and my ever running Mississippi with"
waltwhitman,"bends and chutes,"
waltwhitman,"And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of"
waltwhitman,"Missouri,"
waltwhitman,"The Continent, devoting the whole identity without reserving an atom,"
waltwhitman,"Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all and the yield"
waltwhitman,"of all,"
waltwhitman,"Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole,"
waltwhitman,"No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,"
waltwhitman,"But out of the night emerging for food, our voice persuasive no more,"
waltwhitman,Croaking like crows here in the wind.
waltwhitman,_Poet_
waltwhitman,"My limbs, my veins dilate, my theme is clear at last,"
waltwhitman,"Banner so broad advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty and"
waltwhitman,"resolute,"
waltwhitman,"I burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen'd and blinded,"
waltwhitman,"My hearing and tongue are come to me (a little child taught me),"
waltwhitman,"I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand,"
waltwhitman,"Insensate! insensate (yet I at any rate chant you), O banner!"
waltwhitman,"Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their prosperity"
waltwhitman,"(if need be, you shall again have every one of those houses to"
waltwhitman,destroy them.
waltwhitman,"You thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast,"
waltwhitman,"full of comfort, built with money,"
waltwhitman,"May they stand fast, then? not an hour except you above them and all"
waltwhitman,stand fast);
waltwhitman,"O banner, not money so precious are you, not farm produce you, nor the"
waltwhitman,"material good nutriment,"
waltwhitman,"Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships,"
waltwhitman,"Not the superb ships with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and"
waltwhitman,"carrying cargoes,"
waltwhitman,"Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues--but you as henceforth"
waltwhitman,"I see you,"
waltwhitman,"Running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars"
waltwhitman,"(ever-enlarging stars),"
waltwhitman,"Divider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touch'd by the sun,"
waltwhitman,"measuring the sky,"
waltwhitman,"(Passionately seen and yearn'd for by one poor little child,"
waltwhitman,"While others remain busy or smartly talking, forever teaching thrift,"
waltwhitman,thrift);
waltwhitman,O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake hissing so
waltwhitman,"curious,"
waltwhitman,"Out of reach, an idea only, yet furiously fought for, risking bloody"
waltwhitman,"death, loved by me,"
waltwhitman,So loved--O you banner leading the day with stars brought from the
waltwhitman,night!
waltwhitman,"Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all--(absolute"
waltwhitman,owner of all)--O banner and pennant!
waltwhitman,"I too leave the rest!--great as it is, it is nothing--houses,"
waltwhitman,machines are nothing--I see them not.
waltwhitman,"I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes, I"
waltwhitman,"sing you only,"
waltwhitman,Flapping up there in the wind.
waltwhitman,THE DYING VETERAN
waltwhitman,(_A Long Island incident--early part of the nineteenth century._)
waltwhitman,"Amid these days of order, ease, prosperity,"
waltwhitman,"Amid the current songs of beauty, peace, decorum,"
waltwhitman,"I cast a reminiscence--(likely 't will offend you,"
waltwhitman,"I heard it in my boyhood)--More than a generation since,"
waltwhitman,"A queer old savage man, a fighter under Washington himself"
waltwhitman,"(Large, brave, cleanly, hot-blooded, no talker, rather spiritualistic,"
waltwhitman,Had fought in the ranks--fought well--had been all through the
waltwhitman,"Revolutionary war),"
waltwhitman,"Lay dying--sons, daughters, church-deacons, lovingly tending him,"
waltwhitman,"Sharping their sense, their ears, towards his murmuring, half-caught"
waltwhitman,words:
waltwhitman,"""Let me return again to my war-days,"
waltwhitman,"To the sights and scenes--to forming the line of battle,"
waltwhitman,"To the scouts ahead reconnoitering,"
waltwhitman,"To the cannons, the grim artillery,"
waltwhitman,"To the galloping aids, carrying orders,"
waltwhitman,"To the wounded, the fallen, the heat, the suspense,"
waltwhitman,"The perfume strong, the smoke, the deafening noise;"
waltwhitman,Away with your life of peace!--your joys of peace!
waltwhitman,"Give me my old wild battle-life again!"""
waltwhitman,THE WOUND-DRESSER
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"An old man bending I come among new faces,"
waltwhitman,"Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,"
waltwhitman,"Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me"
waltwhitman,"(Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless"
waltwhitman,"war,"
waltwhitman,"But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd myself,"
waltwhitman,"To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead);"
waltwhitman,"Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,"
waltwhitman,Of unsurpass'd heroes (was one side so brave? the other was equally
waltwhitman,brave);
waltwhitman,"Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,"
waltwhitman,Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?
waltwhitman,"What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,"
waltwhitman,Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"O maidens and young men I love and that love me,"
waltwhitman,What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking
waltwhitman,"recalls,"
waltwhitman,"Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and dust,"
waltwhitman,"In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the"
waltwhitman,"rush of successful charge,"
waltwhitman,"Enter the captur'd works--yet lo, like a swift-running river they fade,"
waltwhitman,Pass and are gone they fade--I dwell not on soldiers' perils or
waltwhitman,soldiers' joys
waltwhitman,"(Both I remember well--many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was"
waltwhitman,content).
waltwhitman,"But in silence, in dreams' projections,"
waltwhitman,"While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,"
waltwhitman,"So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the"
waltwhitman,"sand,"
waltwhitman,"With hinged knees returning I enter the doors (while for you up there,"
waltwhitman,"Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart)."
waltwhitman,"Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,"
waltwhitman,"Straight and swift to my wounded I go,"
waltwhitman,"Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,"
waltwhitman,"Where their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground,"
waltwhitman,"Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital,"
waltwhitman,"To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,"
waltwhitman,"To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,"
waltwhitman,"An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,"
waltwhitman,"Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill'd"
waltwhitman,again.
waltwhitman,"I onward go, I stop,"
waltwhitman,"With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,"
waltwhitman,"I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,"
waltwhitman,"One turns to me his appealing eyes--poor boy! I never knew you,"
waltwhitman,"Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that"
waltwhitman,would save you.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"On, on I go (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)"
waltwhitman,"The crush'd head I dress (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away),"
waltwhitman,The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through I
waltwhitman,"examine,"
waltwhitman,"Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life"
waltwhitman,"struggles hard,"
waltwhitman,(Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!
waltwhitman,In mercy come quickly).
waltwhitman,"From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,"
waltwhitman,"I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and"
waltwhitman,"blood,"
waltwhitman,Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and side-falling
waltwhitman,"head,"
waltwhitman,"His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the bloody"
waltwhitman,"stump,"
waltwhitman,And has not yet look'd on it.
waltwhitman,"I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,"
waltwhitman,"But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,"
waltwhitman,And the yellow-blue countenance see.
waltwhitman,"I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,"
waltwhitman,"Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so"
waltwhitman,"offensive,"
waltwhitman,While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.
waltwhitman,"I am faithful, I do not give out,"
waltwhitman,"The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,"
waltwhitman,These and more I dress with impassive hand (yet deep in my breast a
waltwhitman,"fire, a burning flame)."
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"Thus in silence in dreams' projections,"
waltwhitman,"Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,"
waltwhitman,"The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,"
waltwhitman,"I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,"
waltwhitman,"Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad"
waltwhitman,"(Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and rested,"
waltwhitman,Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips).
waltwhitman,DIRGE FOR TWO VETERANS
waltwhitman,The last sunbeam
waltwhitman,"Lightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,"
waltwhitman,"On the pavement here, and there beyond it is looking"
waltwhitman,Down a new-made double grave
waltwhitman,"Lo, the moon ascending,"
waltwhitman,"Up from the east the silvery round moon,"
waltwhitman,"Beautiful over the house-tops, ghastly, phantom moon,"
waltwhitman,Immense and silent moon.
waltwhitman,"I see a sad procession,"
waltwhitman,"And I hear the sound of coming full-key'd bugles,"
waltwhitman,"All the channels of the city streets they're flooding,"
waltwhitman,As with voices and with tears.
waltwhitman,"I hear the great drums pounding,"
waltwhitman,"And the small drums steady whirring,"
waltwhitman,"And every blow of the great convulsive drums,"
waltwhitman,Strikes me through and through.
waltwhitman,For the son is brought with the father
waltwhitman,"(In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell,"
waltwhitman,"Two veterans, son and father, dropt together,"
waltwhitman,And the double grave awaits them).
waltwhitman,"Now nearer blow the bugles,"
waltwhitman,"And the drums strike more convulsive,"
waltwhitman,"And the daylight over the pavement quite has faded,"
waltwhitman,And the strong dead-march enwraps me.
waltwhitman,"In the eastern sky up-buoying,"
waltwhitman,The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin'd
waltwhitman,"('Tis some mother's large transparent face,"
waltwhitman,In heaven brighter growing).
waltwhitman,O strong dead-march you please me!
waltwhitman,O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me!
waltwhitman,O my soldiers twain! O my veterans passing to burial!
waltwhitman,What I have I also give you.
waltwhitman,"The moon gives you light,"
waltwhitman,"And the bugles and the drums give you music,"
waltwhitman,"And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,"
waltwhitman,My heart gives you love.
waltwhitman,FROM FAR DAKOTA'S CAÑONS
waltwhitman,"_June 25, 1876._"
waltwhitman,"From far Dakota's cañons,"
waltwhitman,"Lands of the wild ravine, the dusky Sioux, the lonesome stretch, the"
waltwhitman,"silence,"
waltwhitman,"Haply to-day a mournful wail, haply a trumpet-note for heroes."
waltwhitman,"The battle-bulletin,"
waltwhitman,"The Indian ambuscade, the craft, the fatal environment,"
waltwhitman,"The cavalry companies fighting to the last in sternest heroism,"
waltwhitman,"In the midst of their little circle, with their slaughter'd horses for"
waltwhitman,"breastworks,"
waltwhitman,The fall of Custer and all his officers and men.
waltwhitman,"Continues yet the old, old legend of our race,"
waltwhitman,"The loftiest of life upheld by death,"
waltwhitman,"The ancient banner perfectly maintain'd,"
waltwhitman,"O lesson opportune, O how I welcome thee!"
waltwhitman,"As sitting in dark days,"
waltwhitman,"Lone, sulky, through the time's thick murk looking in vain for"
waltwhitman,"light, for hope,"
waltwhitman,From unsuspected parts a fierce and momentary proof
waltwhitman,"(The sun there at the centre though conceal'd,"
waltwhitman,"Electric life forever at the centre),"
waltwhitman,Breaks forth a lightning flash.
waltwhitman,"Thou of the tawny flowing hair in battle,"
waltwhitman,"I erewhile saw, with erect head, pressing ever in front, bearing a"
waltwhitman,"bright sword in thy hand,"
waltwhitman,Now ending well in death the splendid fever of thy deeds
waltwhitman,"(I bring no dirge for it or thee, I bring a glad triumphal sonnet),"
waltwhitman,"Desperate and glorious, aye in defeat most desperate, most glorious,"
waltwhitman,"After thy many battles in which never yielding up a gun or a colour,"
waltwhitman,"Leaving behind thee a memory sweet to soldiers,"
waltwhitman,Thou yieldest up thyself.
waltwhitman,OLD WAR-DREAMS
waltwhitman,"In midnight sleep of many a face of anguish,"
waltwhitman,Of the look at first of the mortally wounded (of that indescribable
waltwhitman,"look),"
waltwhitman,"Of the dead on their backs with arms extended wide,"
waltwhitman,"I dream, I dream, I dream."
waltwhitman,"Of scenes of Nature, fields and mountains,"
waltwhitman,"Of skies so beauteous after a storm, and at night the moon so unearthly"
waltwhitman,"bright,"
waltwhitman,"Shining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches and gather the"
waltwhitman,"heaps,"
waltwhitman,"I dream, I dream, I dream."
waltwhitman,"Long have they pass'd, faces and trenches and fields,"
waltwhitman,"Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure, or away"
waltwhitman,"from the fallen,"
waltwhitman,"Onward I sped at the time--but now of their forms at night,"
waltwhitman,"I dream, I dream, I dream."
waltwhitman,DELICATE CLUSTER
waltwhitman,Delicate cluster! flag of teeming life!
waltwhitman,Covering all my lands--all my seashores lining!
waltwhitman,Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke of battle pressing!
waltwhitman,"How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)"
waltwhitman,"Flag cerulean--sunny flag, with the orbs of night dappled!"
waltwhitman,Ah my silvery beauty--ah my woolly white and crimson!
waltwhitman,"Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty!"
waltwhitman,"My sacred one, my mother!"
waltwhitman,TO A CERTAIN CIVILIAN
waltwhitman,Did you ask dulcet rhymes from me?
waltwhitman,Did you seek the civilian's peaceful and languishing rhymes?
waltwhitman,Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow?
waltwhitman,"Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to understand--nor"
waltwhitman,am I now;
waltwhitman,"(I have been born of the same as the war was born,"
waltwhitman,"The drum-corps' rattle is ever to me sweet music, I love well the"
waltwhitman,"martial dirge,"
waltwhitman,With slow wail and convulsive throb leading the officer's funeral);
waltwhitman,"What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I? therefore leave my works,"
waltwhitman,"And go lull yourself with what you can understand, and with"
waltwhitman,"piano-tunes,"
waltwhitman,"For I lull nobody, and you will never understand me."
waltwhitman,ADIEU TO A SOLDIER
waltwhitman,"Adieu O soldier,"
waltwhitman,"You of the rude campaigning (which we shared),"
waltwhitman,"The rapid march, the life of the camp,"
waltwhitman,"The hot contention of opposing fronts, the long manoeuvre,"
waltwhitman,"Red battles with their slaughter, the stimulus, the strong terrific"
waltwhitman,"game,"
waltwhitman,"Spell of all brave and manly hearts, the trains of time through you and"
waltwhitman,"like of you all fill'd,"
waltwhitman,With war and war's expression.
waltwhitman,"Adieu dear comrade,"
waltwhitman,"Your mission is fulfill'd--but I, more warlike,"
waltwhitman,"Myself and this contentious soul of mine,"
waltwhitman,"Still on our own campaigning bound,"
waltwhitman,"Through untried roads with ambushes opponents lined,"
waltwhitman,"Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis, often baffled,"
waltwhitman,"Here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out--aye here,"
waltwhitman,"To fiercer, weightier battles give expression."
waltwhitman,"LONG, TOO LONG AMERICA"
waltwhitman,"Long, too long America,"
waltwhitman,Travelling roads all even and peaceful you learn'd from joys and
waltwhitman,"prosperity only,"
waltwhitman,"But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish, advancing,"
waltwhitman,"grappling with direst fate and recoiling not,"
waltwhitman,And now to conceive and show to the world what your children en-masse
waltwhitman,really are.
waltwhitman,(For who except myself has yet conceiv'd what your children en-masse
waltwhitman,really are?).

waltwhitman,POEMS OF AFTER-WAR
waltwhitman,"WEAVE IN, MY HARDY LIFE"
waltwhitman,"Weave in, weave in, my hardy life,"
waltwhitman,"Weave yet a soldier strong and full for great campaigns to come,"
waltwhitman,"Weave in red blood, weave sinews in like ropes, the senses, sight"
waltwhitman,"weave in,"
waltwhitman,"Weave lasting sure, weave day and night the weft, the warp, incessant"
waltwhitman,"weave, tire not"
waltwhitman,"(We know not what the use O life, nor know the aim, the end, nor really"
waltwhitman,"aught we know,"
waltwhitman,"But know the work, the need goes on and shall go on, the"
waltwhitman,"death-envelop'd march of peace as well as war goes on),"
waltwhitman,"For great campaigns of peace the same the wiry threads to weave,"
waltwhitman,"We know not why or what, yet weave, forever weave."
waltwhitman,HOW SOLEMN AS ONE BY ONE
waltwhitman,"(_Washington City, 1865_)"
waltwhitman,"How solemn as one by one,"
waltwhitman,"As the ranks returning worn and sweaty, as the men file by where I"
waltwhitman,"stand,"
waltwhitman,"As the faces the masks appear, as I glance at the faces studying the"
waltwhitman,masks
waltwhitman,"(As I glance upward out of this page studying you, dear friend,"
waltwhitman,"whoever you are),"
waltwhitman,"How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks,"
waltwhitman,and to you!
waltwhitman,"I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul,"
waltwhitman,"O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,"
waltwhitman,Nor the bayonet stab what you really are;
waltwhitman,"The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,"
waltwhitman,"Waiting secure and content, which the bullet could never kill,"
waltwhitman,Nor the bayonet stab O friend.
waltwhitman,SPIRIT WHOSE WORK IS DONE
waltwhitman,"(_Washington City, 1865_)"
waltwhitman,Spirit whose work is done--spirit of dreadful hours!
waltwhitman,Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets;
waltwhitman,Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts (yet onward ever unfaltering
waltwhitman,"pressing),"
waltwhitman,"Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene--electric spirit,"
waltwhitman,"That with muttering voice through the war now closed, like a tireless"
waltwhitman,"phantom flitted,"
waltwhitman,"Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the"
waltwhitman,"drum,"
waltwhitman,"Now as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,"
waltwhitman,"reverberates round me,"
waltwhitman,"As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles,"
waltwhitman,"As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders,"
waltwhitman,"As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders,"
waltwhitman,"As those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them appearing in the"
waltwhitman,"distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,"
waltwhitman,"Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro to the right and left,"
waltwhitman,"Evenly, lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time;"
waltwhitman,"Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death"
waltwhitman,"next day,"
waltwhitman,"Touch my mouth ere you depart, press my lips close,"
waltwhitman,Leave me your pulses of rage--bequeath them to me--fill me with
waltwhitman,"currents convulsive,"
waltwhitman,"Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone,"
waltwhitman,Let them identify you to the future in these songs.
waltwhitman,THE RETURN OF THE HEROES
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"For the lands and for these passionate days and for myself,"
waltwhitman,"Now I awhile retire to thee O soil of autumn fields,"
waltwhitman,"Reclining on thy breast, giving myself to thee,"
waltwhitman,"Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart,"
waltwhitman,Tuning a verse for thee.
waltwhitman,"O earth that hast no voice, confide to me a voice,"
waltwhitman,"O harvest of my lands--O boundless summer growths,"
waltwhitman,"O lavish brown parturient earth--O infinite teeming womb,"
waltwhitman,A song to narrate thee.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Ever upon this stage,"
waltwhitman,"Is acted God's calm annual drama,"
waltwhitman,"Gorgeous processions, songs of birds,"
waltwhitman,"Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul,"
waltwhitman,"The heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, strong waves,"
waltwhitman,"The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering trees,"
waltwhitman,"The liliput countless armies of the grass,"
waltwhitman,"The heat, the showers, the measureless pasturages,"
waltwhitman,"The scenery of the snows, the winds' free orchestra,"
waltwhitman,"The stretching light-hung roof of clouds, the clear cerulean and the"
waltwhitman,"silvery fringes,"
waltwhitman,"The high-dilating stars, the placid beckoning stars,"
waltwhitman,"The moving flocks and herds, the plains and emerald meadows,"
waltwhitman,The shows of all the varied lands and all the growths and products.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"Fecund America--to-day,"
waltwhitman,Thou art all over set in births and joys!
waltwhitman,"Thou groan'st with riches, thy wealth clothes thee as a swathing"
waltwhitman,"garment,"
waltwhitman,"Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions,"
waltwhitman,A myriad-twining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast
waltwhitman,"demesne,"
waltwhitman,"As some huge ship freighted to water's edge thou ridest into port,"
waltwhitman,"As rain falls from the heaven and vapours rise from the earth, so"
waltwhitman,have the precious values fallen upon thee and risen out of
waltwhitman,thee;
waltwhitman,Thou envy of the globe! thou miracle!
waltwhitman,"Thou, bathed, choked, swimming in plenty,"
waltwhitman,"Thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns,"
waltwhitman,Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon thy
waltwhitman,"world, and lookest East and lookest West,"
waltwhitman,"Dispensatress, that by a word givest a thousand miles, a million"
waltwhitman,"farms, and missest nothing,"
waltwhitman,Thou all-acceptress--thou hospitable (thou only art hospitable as
waltwhitman,God is hospitable).
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"When late I sang sad was my voice,"
waltwhitman,Sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred and
waltwhitman,smoke of war;
waltwhitman,"In the midst of the conflict, the heroes, I stood,"
waltwhitman,Or pass'd with slow step through the wounded and dying.
waltwhitman,"But now I sing not war,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the measur'd march of soldiers, nor the tents of camps,"
waltwhitman,Nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle;
waltwhitman,"No more the sad, unnatural shows of war."
waltwhitman,"Ask'd room those flush'd immortal ranks, the first forth-stepping"
waltwhitman,armies?
waltwhitman,"Ask room alas the ghastly ranks, the armies dread that follow'd."
waltwhitman,"(Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, with your tramping sinewy legs,"
waltwhitman,"With your shoulders young and strong, with your knapsacks and your"
waltwhitman,muskets;
waltwhitman,"How elate I stood and watch'd you, where starting off you march'd."
waltwhitman,"Pass--then rattle drums again,"
waltwhitman,"For an army heaves in sight, O another gathering army,"
waltwhitman,"Swarming, trailing on the rear, O you dread accruing army,"
waltwhitman,"O you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea, with your"
waltwhitman,"fever,"
waltwhitman,"O my land's maim'd darlings, with the plenteous bloody bandage and the"
waltwhitman,"crutch,"
waltwhitman,"Lo, your pallid army follows.)"
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"But on these days of brightness,"
waltwhitman,"On the far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes, the"
waltwhitman,"high-piled farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns,"
waltwhitman,Should the dead intrude?
waltwhitman,"Ah the dead to me mar not, they fit well in Nature,"
waltwhitman,"They fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass,"
waltwhitman,And along the edge of the sky in the horizon's far margin.
waltwhitman,"Nor do I forget you Departed,"
waltwhitman,"Nor in winter or summer my lost ones,"
waltwhitman,"But most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at peace, like"
waltwhitman,"pleasing phantoms,"
waltwhitman,Your memories rising glide silently by me.
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,"I saw the day the return of the heroes,"
waltwhitman,"(Yet the heroes never surpass'd shall never return,"
waltwhitman,Them that day I saw not).
waltwhitman,"I saw the interminable corps, I saw the processions of armies,"
waltwhitman,"I saw them approaching, defiling by with divisions,"
waltwhitman,"Streaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters of"
waltwhitman,mighty camps.
waltwhitman,"No holiday soldiers--youthful, yet veterans,"
waltwhitman,"Worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and workshop,"
waltwhitman,"Harden'd of many a long campaign and sweaty march,"
waltwhitman,Inured on many a hard-fought bloody field.
waltwhitman,"A pause--the armies wait,"
waltwhitman,"A million flush'd embattled conquerors wait,"
waltwhitman,"The world too waits, then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn,"
waltwhitman,"They melt, they disappear."
waltwhitman,Exult O lands! victorious lands!
waltwhitman,"Not there your victory on those red shuddering fields,"
waltwhitman,But here and hence your victory.
waltwhitman,"Melt, melt away ye armies--disperse ye blue-clad soldiers,"
waltwhitman,"Resolve ye back again, give up for good your deadly arms,"
waltwhitman,"Other the arms the fields henceforth for you, or South or North,"
waltwhitman,"With saner wars, sweet wars, life-giving wars."
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,"Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!"
waltwhitman,"The season of thanks and the voice of full-yielding,"
waltwhitman,The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.
waltwhitman,"All till'd and untill'd fields expand before me,"
waltwhitman,"I see the true arenas of my race, or first or last,"
waltwhitman,Man's innocent and strong arenas.
waltwhitman,"I see the heroes at other toils,"
waltwhitman,I see well-wielded in their hands the better weapons.
waltwhitman,"I see where the Mother of All,"
waltwhitman,"With full-spanning eye gazes forth, dwells long,"
waltwhitman,And counts the varied gathering of the products.
waltwhitman,"Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,"
waltwhitman,"Prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the North,"
waltwhitman,"Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane,"
waltwhitman,"Open unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,"
waltwhitman,"Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,"
waltwhitman,"And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook,"
waltwhitman,"And healthy uplands with herby-perfumed breezes,"
waltwhitman,"And the good green grass, that delicate miracle the ever-recurring"
waltwhitman,grass.
waltwhitman,Toil on heroes! harvest the products!
waltwhitman,"Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All,"
waltwhitman,With dilated form and lambent eyes watch'd you.
waltwhitman,Toil on heroes! toil well! handle the weapons well!
waltwhitman,"The Mother of All, yet here as ever she watches you."
waltwhitman,"Well-pleased America thou beholdest,"
waltwhitman,"Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters,"
waltwhitman,"The human-divine inventions, the labour-saving implements;"
waltwhitman,Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the revolving
waltwhitman,"hay-rakes,"
waltwhitman,"The steam-power reaping-machines and the horse-power machines,"
waltwhitman,"The engines, thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain, well"
waltwhitman,"separating the straw, the nimble work of the patent pitchfork,"
waltwhitman,"Beholdest the newer saw-mill, the southern cotton-gin, and the"
waltwhitman,rice-cleanser.
waltwhitman,"Beneath thy look O Maternal,"
waltwhitman,With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes harvest.
waltwhitman,"All gather and all harvest,"
waltwhitman,"Yet but for thee O Powerful, not a scythe might swing as now in"
waltwhitman,"security,"
waltwhitman,Not a maize-stalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace.
waltwhitman,"Under thee only they harvest, even but a wisp of hay under thy great"
waltwhitman,"face only,"
waltwhitman,"Harvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, every barbed spear"
waltwhitman,"under thee,"
waltwhitman,"Harvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, each ear in its"
waltwhitman,"light-green sheath,"
waltwhitman,"Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns,"
waltwhitman,"Oats to their bins, the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, to"
waltwhitman,theirs;
waltwhitman,"Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama, dig and hoard the"
waltwhitman,"golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,"
waltwhitman,"Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,"
waltwhitman,"Cut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp or tobacco in the Borders,"
waltwhitman,"Pick the pea and the bean, or pull apples from the trees or bunches of"
waltwhitman,"grapes from the vines,"
waltwhitman,"Or aught that ripens in all these States or North or South,"
waltwhitman,Under the beaming sun and under thee.
waltwhitman,MEMORIES OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN
waltwhitman,WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd,"
waltwhitman,"And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the night,"
waltwhitman,"I mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring."
waltwhitman,"Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,"
waltwhitman,"Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,"
waltwhitman,And thought of him I love.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,O powerful western fallen star!
waltwhitman,"O shades of night--O moody, tearful night!"
waltwhitman,O great star disappear'd--O the black murk that hides the star!
waltwhitman,O cruel hands that hold me powerless--O helpless soul of me!
waltwhitman,O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash'd
waltwhitman,"palings,"
waltwhitman,Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich
waltwhitman,"green,"
waltwhitman,"With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I"
waltwhitman,"love,"
waltwhitman,"With every leaf a miracle--and from this bush in the door-yard,"
waltwhitman,"With delicate-colour'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green,"
waltwhitman,A sprig with its flower I break.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"In the swamp in secluded recesses,"
waltwhitman,A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.
waltwhitman,"Solitary the thrush,"
waltwhitman,"The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,"
waltwhitman,Sings by himself a song.
waltwhitman,"Song of the bleeding throat,"
waltwhitman,"Death's outlet song of life (for well dear brother I know,"
waltwhitman,If thou wast not granted to sing thou would'st surely die).
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,"
waltwhitman,"Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep'd"
waltwhitman,"from the ground, spotting the gray débris,"
waltwhitman,"Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the"
waltwhitman,"endless grass,"
waltwhitman,"Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the"
waltwhitman,"dark-brown fields uprisen,"
waltwhitman,"Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards,"
waltwhitman,"Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,"
waltwhitman,Night and day journeys a coffin.
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,"Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,"
waltwhitman,"Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land,"
waltwhitman,"With the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in black,"
waltwhitman,With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil'd women
waltwhitman,"standing,"
waltwhitman,"With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,"
waltwhitman,"With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the"
waltwhitman,"unbared heads,"
waltwhitman,"With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,"
waltwhitman,"With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising"
waltwhitman,"strong and solemn,"
waltwhitman,"With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the coffin,"
waltwhitman,The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs--where amid these you
waltwhitman,"journey,"
waltwhitman,"With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,"
waltwhitman,"Here, coffin that slowly passes,"
waltwhitman,I give you my sprig of lilac.
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,"(Nor for you, for one alone,"
waltwhitman,"Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring,"
waltwhitman,"For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O sane and"
waltwhitman,sacred death.
waltwhitman,"All over bouquets of roses,"
waltwhitman,"O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies,"
waltwhitman,"But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,"
waltwhitman,"Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,"
waltwhitman,"With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,"
waltwhitman,For you and the coffins all of you O death.)
waltwhitman,8
waltwhitman,"O western orb sailing the heaven,"
waltwhitman,"Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk'd,"
waltwhitman,"As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,"
waltwhitman,"As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,"
waltwhitman,As you dropp'd from the sky low down as if to my side (while the other
waltwhitman,"stars all look'd on),"
waltwhitman,As we wander'd together the solemn night (for something I know not what
waltwhitman,"kept me from sleep),"
waltwhitman,"As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you"
waltwhitman,"were of woe,"
waltwhitman,As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent
waltwhitman,"night,"
waltwhitman,As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black
waltwhitman,"of the night,"
waltwhitman,"As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb,"
waltwhitman,"Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone."
waltwhitman,9
waltwhitman,"Sing on there in the swamp,"
waltwhitman,"O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call,"
waltwhitman,"I hear, I come presently, I understand you,"
waltwhitman,"But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd me,"
waltwhitman,The star my departing comrade holds and detains me.
waltwhitman,10
waltwhitman,O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?
waltwhitman,And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?
waltwhitman,And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?
waltwhitman,"Sea-winds blown from east and west,"
waltwhitman,"Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till"
waltwhitman,"there on the prairies meeting,"
waltwhitman,"These and with these and the breath of my chant,"
waltwhitman,I'll perfume the grave of him I love.
waltwhitman,11
waltwhitman,O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?
waltwhitman,"And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,"
waltwhitman,To adorn the burial-house of him I love?
waltwhitman,"Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,"
waltwhitman,"With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and"
waltwhitman,"bright,"
waltwhitman,"With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun,"
waltwhitman,"burning, expanding the air,"
waltwhitman,"With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves"
waltwhitman,"of the trees prolific,"
waltwhitman,"In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a"
waltwhitman,"wind-dapple here and there,"
waltwhitman,"With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and"
waltwhitman,"shadows,"
waltwhitman,"And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,"
waltwhitman,"And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward"
waltwhitman,returning.
waltwhitman,12
waltwhitman,"Lo, body and soul--this land,"
waltwhitman,"My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides,"
waltwhitman,"and the ships,"
waltwhitman,"The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light, Ohio's"
waltwhitman,"shores and flashing Missouri,"
waltwhitman,And ever the far-spreading prairies cover'd with grass and corn.
waltwhitman,"Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,"
waltwhitman,"The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,"
waltwhitman,"The gentle soft-born measureless light,"
waltwhitman,"The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill'd noon,"
waltwhitman,"The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,"
waltwhitman,"Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land."
waltwhitman,13
waltwhitman,"Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird,"
waltwhitman,"Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes,"
waltwhitman,"Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines."
waltwhitman,"Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,"
waltwhitman,"Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe."
waltwhitman,O liquid and free and tender!
waltwhitman,O wild and loose to my soul--O wondrous singer!
waltwhitman,"You only I hear--yet the star holds me (but will soon depart),"
waltwhitman,Yet the lilac with mastering odour holds me.
waltwhitman,14
waltwhitman,"Now while I sat in the day and look'd forth,"
waltwhitman,"In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and"
waltwhitman,"the farmers preparing their crops,"
waltwhitman,"In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests,"
waltwhitman,In the heavenly aerial beauty (after the perturb'd winds and the
waltwhitman,"storms),"
waltwhitman,"Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the"
waltwhitman,"voices of children and women,"
waltwhitman,"The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail'd,"
waltwhitman,"And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with"
waltwhitman,"labour,"
waltwhitman,"And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with"
waltwhitman,"its meals and minutia of daily usages,"
waltwhitman,"And the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities pent--lo,"
waltwhitman,"then and there,"
waltwhitman,"Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,"
waltwhitman,"Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail,"
waltwhitman,"And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death."
waltwhitman,"Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,"
waltwhitman,"And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,"
waltwhitman,"And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of"
waltwhitman,"companions,"
waltwhitman,"I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,"
waltwhitman,"Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,"
waltwhitman,To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.
waltwhitman,"And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me,"
waltwhitman,"The gray-brown bird I know receiv'd us comrades three,"
waltwhitman,"And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love."
waltwhitman,"From deep secluded recesses,"
waltwhitman,"From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,"
waltwhitman,Came the carol of the bird.
waltwhitman,"And the charm of the carol rapt me,"
waltwhitman,"As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,"
waltwhitman,And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.
waltwhitman,"_Come lovely and soothing death,"
waltwhitman,"Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,"
waltwhitman,"In the day, in the night, to all, to each,"
waltwhitman,Sooner or later delicate death._
waltwhitman,"_Prais'd be the fathomless universe,"
waltwhitman,"For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,"
waltwhitman,"And for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!"
waltwhitman,For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death._
waltwhitman,"_Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,"
waltwhitman,Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?
waltwhitman,"Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,"
waltwhitman,"I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come"
waltwhitman,unfalteringly._
waltwhitman,"_Approach strong deliveress,"
waltwhitman,"When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,"
waltwhitman,"Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,"
waltwhitman,Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death._
waltwhitman,"_From me to thee glad serenades,"
waltwhitman,"Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings"
waltwhitman,"for thee,"
waltwhitman,And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are
waltwhitman,"fitting,"
waltwhitman,"And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night._"
waltwhitman,"_The night in silence under many a star,"
waltwhitman,"The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,"
waltwhitman,"And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil'd death,"
waltwhitman,And the body gratefully nestling close to thee._
waltwhitman,"_Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,"
waltwhitman,"Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the"
waltwhitman,"prairies wide,"
waltwhitman,"Over the dense-pack'd cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,"
waltwhitman,"I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death._"
waltwhitman,15
waltwhitman,"To the tally of my soul,"
waltwhitman,"Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,"
waltwhitman,With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.
waltwhitman,"Loud in the pines and cedars dim,"
waltwhitman,"Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,"
waltwhitman,And I with my comrades there in the night.
waltwhitman,"While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,"
waltwhitman,As to long panoramas of visions.
waltwhitman,"And I saw askant the armies,"
waltwhitman,"I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,"
waltwhitman,Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles I saw
waltwhitman,"them,"
waltwhitman,"And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,"
waltwhitman,"And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs (and all in silence),"
waltwhitman,And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.
waltwhitman,"I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,"
waltwhitman,"And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,"
waltwhitman,"I saw the débris and débris of all the slain soldiers of the war,"

waltwhitman,"Passing the visions, passing the night,"
waltwhitman,"Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,"
waltwhitman,"Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,"
waltwhitman,"Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,"
waltwhitman,"As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,"
waltwhitman,"flooding the night,"
waltwhitman,"Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again"
waltwhitman,"bursting with joy,"
waltwhitman,"Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,"
waltwhitman,"As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,"
waltwhitman,"Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,"
waltwhitman,"I leave thee there in the dooryard, blooming, returning with spring."
waltwhitman,"I cease from my song for thee,"
waltwhitman,"From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with"
waltwhitman,"thee,"
waltwhitman,O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.
waltwhitman,"Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,"
waltwhitman,"The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,"
waltwhitman,"And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,"
waltwhitman,"With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,"
waltwhitman,"With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,"
waltwhitman,"Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for"
waltwhitman,"the dead I loved so well,"
waltwhitman,"For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands--and this for"
waltwhitman,"his dear sake,"
waltwhitman,"Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,"
waltwhitman,There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.
waltwhitman,O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!
waltwhitman,"O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,"
waltwhitman,"The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,"
waltwhitman,"The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,"
waltwhitman,"While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;"
waltwhitman,But O heart! heart! heart!
waltwhitman,"O the bleeding drops of red,"
waltwhitman,"Where on the deck my Captain lies,"
waltwhitman,Fallen cold and dead.
waltwhitman,O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
waltwhitman,"Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills,"
waltwhitman,"For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding,"
waltwhitman,"For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;"
waltwhitman,Here Captain! dear father!
waltwhitman,This arm beneath your head!
waltwhitman,"It is some dream that on the deck,"
waltwhitman,You've fallen cold and dead.
waltwhitman,"My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,"
waltwhitman,"My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,"
waltwhitman,"The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,"
waltwhitman,From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
waltwhitman,"Exult O shores, and ring O bells!"
waltwhitman,"But I with mournful tread,"
waltwhitman,"Walk the deck my Captain lies,"
waltwhitman,Fallen cold and dead.
waltwhitman,HUSH'D BE THE CAMPS TO-DAY
waltwhitman,"(_May 4, 1865_)"
waltwhitman,"Hush'd be the camps to-day,"
waltwhitman,"And soldiers let us drape our war-worn weapons,"
waltwhitman,"And each with musing soul retire to celebrate,"
waltwhitman,Our dear commander's death.
waltwhitman,"No more for him life's stormy conflicts,"
waltwhitman,"Nor victory, nor defeat--no more time's dark events,"
waltwhitman,Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.
waltwhitman,"But sing poet in our name,"
waltwhitman,"Sing of the love we bore him--because you, dweller in camps, know it"
waltwhitman,truly.
waltwhitman,"As they invault the coffin there,"
waltwhitman,"Sing--as they close the doors of earth upon him--one verse,"
waltwhitman,For the heavy hearts of soldiers.
waltwhitman,ASHES OF SOLDIERS
waltwhitman,"Ashes of soldiers South or North,"
waltwhitman,"As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought,"
waltwhitman,"The war resumes, again to my sense your shapes,"
waltwhitman,And again the advance of the armies.
waltwhitman,"Noiseless as mists and vapours,"
waltwhitman,"From their graves in the trenches ascending,"
waltwhitman,"From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee,"
waltwhitman,"From every point of the compass out of the countless graves,"
waltwhitman,"In wafted clouds, in myriads large, or squads of twos or threes or"
waltwhitman,"single ones they come,"
waltwhitman,And silently gather round me.
waltwhitman,"Now sound no note O trumpeters,"
waltwhitman,"Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses,"
waltwhitman,"With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by their thighs (ah"
waltwhitman,my brave horsemen!
waltwhitman,"My handsome tan-faced horsemen! what life, what joy and pride,"
waltwhitman,With all the perils were yours).
waltwhitman,"Nor you drummers, neither at reveillé at dawn,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the long roll alarming the camp, nor even the muffled beat for a"
waltwhitman,"burial,"
waltwhitman,Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlike drums.
waltwhitman,"But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade,"
waltwhitman,"Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless,"
waltwhitman,"The slain elate and alive again, the dust and débris alive,"
waltwhitman,I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers.
waltwhitman,"Faces so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet,"
waltwhitman,"Draw close, but speak not."
waltwhitman,"Phantoms of countless lost,"
waltwhitman,"Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions,"
waltwhitman,Follow me ever--desert me not while I live.
waltwhitman,Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living--sweet are the musical
waltwhitman,"voices sounding,"
waltwhitman,"But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead with their silent eyes."
waltwhitman,"Dearest comrades, all is over and long gone,"
waltwhitman,"But love is not over--and what love, O comrades!"
waltwhitman,"Perfume from battlefields rising, up from the foetor arising."
waltwhitman,"Perfume therefore my chant, O love, immortal love,"
waltwhitman,"Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers,"
waltwhitman,"Shroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender pride."
waltwhitman,"Perfume all--make all wholesome,"
waltwhitman,"Make these ashes to nourish and blossom,"
waltwhitman,"O love, solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry."
waltwhitman,"Give me exhaustless, make me a fountain,"
waltwhitman,"That I exhale love from me wherever I go like a moist perennial dew,"
waltwhitman,For the ashes of all dead soldiers South or North.
waltwhitman,PENSIVE ON HER DEAD GAZING
waltwhitman,"Pensive on her dead gazing I heard the Mother of All,"
waltwhitman,"Desperate on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battlefields"
waltwhitman,gazing
waltwhitman,"(As the last gun ceased, but the scent of the powder-smoke linger'd),"
waltwhitman,"As she call'd to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk'd,"
waltwhitman,"Absorb them well O my earth, she cried, I charge you lose not my"
waltwhitman,"sons, lose not an atom,"
waltwhitman,"And you streams absorb them well, taking their dear blood,"
waltwhitman,"And you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly impalpable,"
waltwhitman,"And all you essences of soil and growth, and you my rivers' depths,"
waltwhitman,"And you mountain sides, and the woods where my dear children's blood"
waltwhitman,"trickling redden'd,"
waltwhitman,"And you trees down in your roots to bequeath to all future trees,"
waltwhitman,"My dead absorb or South or North--my young men's bodies absorb, and"
waltwhitman,"their precious, precious blood,"
waltwhitman,Which holding in trust for me faithfully back again give me many a year
waltwhitman,"hence,"
waltwhitman,"In unseen essence and odour of surface and grass, centuries hence,"
waltwhitman,"In blowing airs from the fields back again give me my darlings, give my"
waltwhitman,"immortal heroes,"
waltwhitman,"Exhale me them centuries hence, breathe me their breath, let not an"
waltwhitman,"atom be lost,"
waltwhitman,"O years and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an aroma sweet!"
waltwhitman,"Exhale them perennial sweet death, years centuries hence."

waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Over the Western sea hither from Niphon come,"
waltwhitman,"Courteous, the swart-cheek'd two-sworded envoys,"
waltwhitman,"Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed, impassive,"
waltwhitman,Ride to-day through Manhattan.
waltwhitman,"Libertad! I do not know whether others behold what I behold,"
waltwhitman,"In the procession along with the nobles of Niphon, the errand-bearers,"
waltwhitman,"Bringing up the rear, hovering above, around, or in the ranks marching,"
waltwhitman,But I will sing you a song of what I behold Libertad.
waltwhitman,"When million-footed Manhattan unpent descends to her pavements,"
waltwhitman,"When the thunder-cracking guns arouse me with the proud roar I love,"
waltwhitman,When the round-mouth'd guns out of the smoke and smell I love spit
waltwhitman,"their salutes,"
waltwhitman,"When the fire-flashing guns have fully alerted me, and heaven-clouds"
waltwhitman,"canopy my city with a delicate thin haze,"
waltwhitman,"When gorgeous the countless straight stems, the forests at the wharves,"
waltwhitman,"thicken with colours,"
waltwhitman,"When every ship richly drest carries her flag at the peak,"
waltwhitman,"When pennants trail and street-festoons hang from the windows,"
waltwhitman,When Broadway is entirely given up to foot-passengers and
waltwhitman,"foot-standers, when the mass is densest,"
waltwhitman,"When the façades of the houses are alive with people, when eyes gaze"
waltwhitman,"riveted tens of thousands at a time,"
waltwhitman,"When the guests from the islands advance, when the pageant moves"
waltwhitman,"forward visible,"
waltwhitman,"When the summons is made, when the answer that waited thousands of"
waltwhitman,"years answers,"
waltwhitman,"I too arising, answering, descend to the pavements, merge with the"

waltwhitman,Superb-faced Manhattan!
waltwhitman,"Comrade Americanos! to us, then at last the Orient comes."
waltwhitman,"To us, my city,"
waltwhitman,Where our tall-topt marble and iron beauties range on opposite
waltwhitman,"sides, to walk in the space between,"
waltwhitman,To-day our Antipodes comes.
waltwhitman,"The Originatress comes,"
waltwhitman,"The nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of eld,"
waltwhitman,"Florid with blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with passion,"
waltwhitman,"Sultry with perfume, with ample and flowing garments,"
waltwhitman,"With sunburnt visage, with intense soul and glittering eyes,"
waltwhitman,The race of Brahma comes.
waltwhitman,See my cantabile! these and more are flashing to us from the
waltwhitman,"procession,"
waltwhitman,"As it moves changing, a kaleidoscope divine it moves changing before"
waltwhitman,us.
waltwhitman,"For not the envoys nor the tann'd Japanee from his island only,"
waltwhitman,"Lithe and silent the Hindoo appears, the Asiatic continent itself"
waltwhitman,"appears, the past, the dead,"
waltwhitman,"The murky night-morning of wonder and fable inscrutable,"

waltwhitman,"I chant the new empire grander than any before, as in a vision it"
waltwhitman,"comes to me,"
waltwhitman,"I chant America the mistress, I chant a greater supremacy,"

waltwhitman,"groups of sea-islands,"
waltwhitman,"My sail-ships and steam-ships threading the archipelagoes,"
waltwhitman,"My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind,"
waltwhitman,"Commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done its work, races reborn,"
waltwhitman,"refresh'd,"
waltwhitman,"Lives, works resumed--the object I know not--but the old, the Asiatic"
waltwhitman,"renew'd as it must be,"
waltwhitman,Commencing from this day surrounded by the world.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,And you Libertad of the world!
waltwhitman,You shall sit in the middle well-pois'd thousands and thousands of
waltwhitman,"years,"
waltwhitman,"As to-day from one side the nobles of Asia come to you,"
waltwhitman,As to-morrow from the other side the queen of England sends her
waltwhitman,eldest son to you.
waltwhitman,"The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,"
waltwhitman,"The ring is circled, the journey is done,"
waltwhitman,"The box-lid is but perceptibly open'd, nevertheless the perfume pours"
waltwhitman,copiously out of the whole box.
waltwhitman,"Young Libertad! with the venerable Asia, the all-mother,"

waltwhitman,Bend your proud neck to the long-off mother now sending messages
waltwhitman,"over the archipelagoes to you,"
waltwhitman,"Bend your proud neck low for once, young Libertad."
waltwhitman,Were the children straying westward so long? so wide the tramping?
waltwhitman,Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from Paradise so long?
waltwhitman,"Were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while"

waltwhitman,They shall now also march obediently eastward for your sake Libertad.
waltwhitman,THE PRAIRIE STATES
waltwhitman,"A newer garden of creation, no primal solitude,"
waltwhitman,"Dense, joyous, modern, populous millions, cities and farms,"
waltwhitman,"With iron interlaced, composite, tied, many in one,"
waltwhitman,"By all the world contributed--freedom's and law's and thrift's society,"
waltwhitman,"The crown and teeming paradise, so far, of time's accumulations,"
waltwhitman,To justify the past.

waltwhitman,POEMS OF DEMOCRACY
waltwhitman,TO FOREIGN LANDS
waltwhitman,I heard that you ask'd for something to prove this puzzle the New
waltwhitman,"World,"
waltwhitman,"And to define America, her athletic Democracy,"
waltwhitman,Therefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you wanted.
waltwhitman,TO THEE OLD CAUSE
waltwhitman,To thee old cause!
waltwhitman,"Thou peerless, passionate, good cause,"
waltwhitman,"Thou stern, remorseless, sweet idea,"
waltwhitman,"Deathless throughout the ages, races, lands,"
waltwhitman,"After a strange sad war, great war for thee"
waltwhitman,"(I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be"
waltwhitman,"really fought, for thee),"
waltwhitman,"These chants for thee, the eternal march of thee."
waltwhitman,"(A war O soldiers not for itself alone,"
waltwhitman,"Far, far more stood silently waiting behind, now to advance in this"
waltwhitman,book.)
waltwhitman,Thou orb of many orbs!
waltwhitman,"Thou seething principle! thou well-kept, latent germ! thou centre!"
waltwhitman,"Around the idea of thee the war revolving,"
waltwhitman,With all its angry and vehement play of causes
waltwhitman,"(With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years),"
waltwhitman,"These recitatives for thee,--my book and the war are one,"
waltwhitman,"Merged in its spirit I and mine, as the contest hinged on thee,"
waltwhitman,"As a wheel on its axis turns, this book unwitting to itself,"
waltwhitman,Around the idea of thee.
waltwhitman,FOR YOU O DEMOCRACY
waltwhitman,"Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,"
waltwhitman,"I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon,"
waltwhitman,"I will make divine magnetic lands,"
waltwhitman,"With the love of comrades,"
waltwhitman,With the life-long love of comrades.
waltwhitman,I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of
waltwhitman,"America, and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over"
waltwhitman,"the prairies,"
waltwhitman,I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each other's
waltwhitman,"necks,"
waltwhitman,"By the love of comrades,"
waltwhitman,By the manly love of comrades.
waltwhitman,"For you these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!"
waltwhitman,"For you, for you I am trilling these songs."
waltwhitman,THOU MOTHER WITH THY EQUAL BROOD
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Thou Mother with thy equal brood,"
waltwhitman,"Thou varied chain of different States, yet one identity only,"
waltwhitman,"A special song before I go I'd sing o'er all the rest,"
waltwhitman,"For thee, the future."
waltwhitman,"I'd sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,"
waltwhitman,"I'd fashion thy ensemble including body and soul,"
waltwhitman,"I'd show away ahead thy real Union, and how it may be accomplish'd."
waltwhitman,"The paths to the house I seek to make,"
waltwhitman,But leave to those to come the house itself.
waltwhitman,"Belief I sing, and preparation;"
waltwhitman,"As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present only,"
waltwhitman,"But greater still from what is yet to come,"
waltwhitman,Out of that formula for thee I sing.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"As a strong bird on pinions free,"
waltwhitman,"Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,"
waltwhitman,"Such be the thought I'd think of thee America,"
waltwhitman,Such be the recitative I'd bring for thee.
waltwhitman,"The conceits of the poets of other lands I'd bring thee not,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,"
waltwhitman,"Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of foreign court or indoor"
waltwhitman,library;
waltwhitman,"But an odour I'd bring as from forests of pine in Maine, or breath"
waltwhitman,"of an Illinois prairie,"
waltwhitman,"With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee, or from Texas"
waltwhitman,"uplands, or Florida's glades,"
waltwhitman,"Or the Saguenay's black stream, or the wide blue spread of Huron,"
waltwhitman,"With presentment of Yellowstone's scenes, or Yosemite,"
waltwhitman,"And murmuring under, pervading all, I'd bring the rustling sea-sound,"
waltwhitman,That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world.
waltwhitman,"And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,"
waltwhitman,"Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, mind-formulas fitted for"
waltwhitman,"thee, real and sane and large as these and thee,"
waltwhitman,"Thou! mounting higher, diving deeper than we knew, thou transcendental"
waltwhitman,Union!
waltwhitman,"By thee fact to be justified, blended with thought,"
waltwhitman,"Thought of man justified, blended with God,"
waltwhitman,"Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality!"
waltwhitman,"Through thy reality, lo, the immortal idea!"
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"Brain of the New World, what a task is thine,"
waltwhitman,"To formulate the Modern--out of the peerless grandeur of the modern,"
waltwhitman,"Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast poems, churches, art"
waltwhitman,"(Recast, maybe discard them, end them--maybe their work is done, who"
waltwhitman,"knows?),"
waltwhitman,"By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the mighty past, the"
waltwhitman,"dead,"
waltwhitman,To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present.
waltwhitman,"And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old World"
waltwhitman,"brain,"
waltwhitman,"Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long,"
waltwhitman,"Thou carefully prepared by it so long--haply thou but unfoldest it,"
waltwhitman,"only maturest it,"
waltwhitman,It to eventuate in thee--the essence of the bygone time contain'd in
waltwhitman,"thee,"
waltwhitman,"Its poems, churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, destined with"
waltwhitman,reference to thee;
waltwhitman,"Thou but the apples, long, long, long a-growing,"
waltwhitman,The fruit of all the Old ripening to-day in thee.

waltwhitman,"Sail, sail thy best, ship of Democracy,"
waltwhitman,"Of value is thy freight, 'tis not the Present only,"
waltwhitman,"The Past is also stored in thee,"
waltwhitman,"Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone, not of the Western"
waltwhitman,"continent alone,"
waltwhitman,"Earth's _résumé_ entire floats on thy keel O ship, is steadied by thy"
waltwhitman,"spars,"
waltwhitman,"With thee Time voyages in trust, the antecedent nations sink or swim"
waltwhitman,"with thee,"
waltwhitman,"With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars, thou"
waltwhitman,"bear'st the other continents,"
waltwhitman,"Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port triumphant;"
waltwhitman,"Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye O helmsman, thou carriest"
waltwhitman,"great companions,"
waltwhitman,"Venerable priestly Asia sails this day with thee,"
waltwhitman,And royal feudal Europe sails with thee.
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes,"
waltwhitman,"Like a limitless golden cloud filling the western sky,"
waltwhitman,"Emblem of general maternity lifted above all,"
waltwhitman,"Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons,"
waltwhitman,Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in ceaseless procession
waltwhitman,"issuing,"
waltwhitman,"Acceding from such gestation, taking and giving continual strength and"
waltwhitman,"life,"
waltwhitman,"World of the real--world of the twain in one,"
waltwhitman,"World of the soul, born by the world of the real alone, led to"
waltwhitman,"identity, body, by it alone,"
waltwhitman,"Yet in beginning only, incalculable masses of composite precious"
waltwhitman,"materials,"
waltwhitman,"By history's cycles forwarded, by every nation, language, hither sent,"
waltwhitman,"Ready, collected here, a freer, vast, electric world, to be constructed"
waltwhitman,here
waltwhitman,"(The true New World, the world of orbic science, morals, literatures to"
waltwhitman,"come),"
waltwhitman,"Thou wonder world yet undefined, unform'd, neither do I define thee,"
waltwhitman,How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future?
waltwhitman,"I feel thy ominous greatness evil as well as good,"
waltwhitman,"I watch thee advancing, absorbing the present, transcending the past,"
waltwhitman,"I see thy light lighting, and thy shadow shadowing, as if the entire"
waltwhitman,"globe,"
waltwhitman,"But I do not undertake to define thee, hardly to comprehend thee,"
waltwhitman,"I but thee name, thee prophesy, as now,"
waltwhitman,I merely thee ejaculate!
waltwhitman,"Thee in thy future,"
waltwhitman,"Thee in thy only permanent life, career, thy own unloosen'd mind, thy"
waltwhitman,"soaring spirit,"
waltwhitman,"Thee as another equally needed sun, radiant, ablaze, swift-moving,"
waltwhitman,"fructifying all,"
waltwhitman,"Thee risen in potent cheerfulness and joy, in endless great hilarity,"
waltwhitman,"Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long, that weigh'd so"
waltwhitman,"long upon the mind of man,"
waltwhitman,"The doubt, suspicion, dread, of gradual, certain decadence of man;"
waltwhitman,"Thee in thy larger, saner brood of female, male--thee in thy athletes,"
waltwhitman,"moral, spiritual, South, North, West, East,"
waltwhitman,"(To thy immortal breasts, Mother of All, thy every daughter, son,"
waltwhitman,"endear'd alike, forever equal),"

waltwhitman,Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization (until which thy proudest
waltwhitman,"material civilization must remain in vain),"
waltwhitman,"Thee in thy all-supplying, all-enclosing worship--thee in no single"
waltwhitman,"bible, saviour, merely,"
waltwhitman,"Thy saviours countless, latent within thyself, thy bibles incessant"
waltwhitman,"within thyself, equal to any, divine as any"
waltwhitman,"(Thy soaring course thee formulating, not in thy two great wars,"
waltwhitman,"nor in thy century's visible growth,"

waltwhitman,WHAT BEST I SEE IN THEE
waltwhitman,_To U. S. G. return'd from his World's Tour._
waltwhitman,What best I see in thee
waltwhitman,"Is not that where thou mov'st down history's great highways,"
waltwhitman,"Ever undimm'd by time shoots warlike victory's dazzle,"
waltwhitman,"Or that thou sat'st where Washington sat, ruling the land in peace,"
waltwhitman,"Or thou the man whom feudal Europe fêted, venerable Asia swarm'd upon"
waltwhitman,Who walk'd with kings with even pace the round world's promenade;
waltwhitman,"But that in foreign lands, in all thy walks with kings,"
waltwhitman,"Those prairie sovereigns of the West, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,"

waltwhitman,"Around me I hear that éclat of the world, politics, produce,"
waltwhitman,"The announcements of recognized things, science,"
waltwhitman,The approved growth of cities and the spread of inventions.
waltwhitman,"I see the ships (they will last a few years),"
waltwhitman,"The vast factories with their foremen and workmen,"
waltwhitman,"And hear the indorsement of all, and do not object to it."
waltwhitman,"But I too announce solid things,"
waltwhitman,"Science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not nothing,"
waltwhitman,"Like a grand procession to music of distant bugles pouring,"
waltwhitman,"triumphantly moving, and grander heaving in sight,"
waltwhitman,They stand for realities--all is as it should be.
waltwhitman,Then my realities;
waltwhitman,What else is so real as mine?
waltwhitman,"Libertad and the divine average, freedom to every slave on the face"

waltwhitman,"The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war,"
waltwhitman,"No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the days and"

waltwhitman,O STAR OF FRANCE
waltwhitman,1870-71
waltwhitman,"O star of France,"
waltwhitman,"The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame,"
waltwhitman,"Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long,"
waltwhitman,"Beseems to-day a wreck driven by the gale, a mastless hulk,"
waltwhitman,"And 'mid its teeming madden'd half-drown'd crowds,"
waltwhitman,Nor helm nor helmsman.
waltwhitman,"Dim smitten star,"
waltwhitman,"Orb not of France alone, pale symbol of my soul its dearest hopes,"
waltwhitman,"The struggle and the daring, rage divine for liberty,"
waltwhitman,"Of aspirations toward the far ideal, enthusiast's dreams of"
waltwhitman,"brotherhood,"
waltwhitman,Of terror to the tyrant and the priest.
waltwhitman,"Star crucified--by traitors sold,"
waltwhitman,"Star panting o'er a land of death, heroic land,"
waltwhitman,"Strange, passionate, mocking, frivolous land."
waltwhitman,"Miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, I will not now rebuke"
waltwhitman,"thee,"
waltwhitman,"Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell'd them all,"
waltwhitman,And left thee sacred.
waltwhitman,"In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly,"
waltwhitman,"In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself however great the price,"
waltwhitman,"In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg'd sleep,"
waltwhitman,"In that alone among thy sisters thou, giantess, didst rend the ones"
waltwhitman,"that shamed thee,"
waltwhitman,"In that thou couldst not, wouldst not, wear the usual chains,"
waltwhitman,"This cross, thy livid face, thy pierced hands and feet,"
waltwhitman,The spear thrust in thy side.
waltwhitman,"O star! O ship of France, beat back and baffled long!"
waltwhitman,Bear up O smitten orb! O ship continue on!
waltwhitman,"Sure as the ship of all, the Earth itself,"
waltwhitman,"Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos,"
waltwhitman,"Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons,"
waltwhitman,"Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty,"
waltwhitman,"Onward beneath the sun following its course,"
waltwhitman,So thee O ship of France!
waltwhitman,"Finish'd the days, the clouds dispel'd,"
waltwhitman,"The travail o'er, the long-sought extrication,"
waltwhitman,"When lo! reborn, high o'er the European world,"
waltwhitman,"(In gladness answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours"
waltwhitman,"Columbia),"
waltwhitman,"Again thy star O France, fair lustrous star,"
waltwhitman,"In heavenly peace, clearer, more bright than ever,"
waltwhitman,Shall beam immortal.
waltwhitman,THOUGHTS
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Of these years I sing,"
waltwhitman,"How they pass and have pass'd through convuls'd pains, as through"
waltwhitman,"parturitions,"
waltwhitman,"How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the promise, the sure"
waltwhitman,"fulfilment, the absolute success, despite of people--illustrates"
waltwhitman,"evil as well as good,"
waltwhitman,The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one's-self;
waltwhitman,"How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, myths,"
waltwhitman,"obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity,"
waltwhitman,"How few see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western States, or"
waltwhitman,"see freedom or spirituality, or hold any faith in results"
waltwhitman,"(But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious and"
waltwhitman,"inevitable, and they again leading to other results)."
waltwhitman,"How the great cities appear--how the Democratic masses, turbulent,"
waltwhitman,"wilful, as I love them,"
waltwhitman,"How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the sound"
waltwhitman,"and resounding, keep on and on,"
waltwhitman,"How society waits unform'd, and is for a while between things ended and"
waltwhitman,"things begun,"
waltwhitman,"How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of"
waltwhitman,"freedom and of the Democracies, and of the fruits of society,"
waltwhitman,"and of all that is begun,"
waltwhitman,And how the States are complete in themselves--and how all triumphs
waltwhitman,"and glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,"
waltwhitman,"And how these of mine and of the States will in turn be convuls'd,"
waltwhitman,"and serve other parturitions and transitions,"
waltwhitman,"And how all people, sights, combinations, the Democratic masses too,"
waltwhitman,"serve--and how every fact, and war itself, with all its"
waltwhitman,"horrors, serves,"
waltwhitman,And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of
waltwhitman,death.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Of seeds dropping into the ground, of births,"
waltwhitman,"Of the steady concentration of America, inland, upward, to impregnable"
waltwhitman,"and swarming places,"
waltwhitman,"Of what Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, and the rest, are to be,"
waltwhitman,"Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada,"
waltwhitman,and the rest
waltwhitman,"(Or afar, mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska),"
waltwhitman,Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for--and of what
waltwhitman,"all sights, North, South, East and West, are,"
waltwhitman,"Of this Union welded in blood, of the solemn price paid, of the unnamed"
waltwhitman,lost ever present in my mind;
waltwhitman,"Of the temporary use of materials for identity's sake,"
waltwhitman,"Of the present, passing, departing--of the growth of completer men"
waltwhitman,"than any yet,"
waltwhitman,"Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother, the"
waltwhitman,"Mississippi flows,"
waltwhitman,"Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey'd and unsuspected,"
waltwhitman,"Of the new and good names, of the modern developments, of inalienable"
waltwhitman,"homesteads,"
waltwhitman,"Of a free and original life there, of simple diet and clean and sweet"
waltwhitman,"blood,"
waltwhitman,"Of litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes, and perfect physique there,"
waltwhitman,"Of immense spiritual results future years far West, each side of the"
waltwhitman,"Anahuacs,"
waltwhitman,"Of these songs, well understood there (being made for that area),"
waltwhitman,Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there
waltwhitman,(O it lurks in me night and day--what is gain after all to savageness
waltwhitman,and freedom?).

waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"By blue Ontario's shore,"

waltwhitman,"that return no more,"
waltwhitman,"A Phantom gigantic superb, with stern visage accosted me,"
waltwhitman,"_Chant me the poem_, it said, _that comes from the soul of America,"
waltwhitman,"chant me the carol of victory,"
waltwhitman,"And strike up the marches of Libertad, marches more powerful yet,"
waltwhitman,And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy._
waltwhitman,"(Democracy, the destin'd conqueror, yet treacherous lip-smiles"
waltwhitman,"everywhere,"
waltwhitman,And death and infidelity at every step.)
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"A Nation announcing itself,"
waltwhitman,"I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,"
waltwhitman,"I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms."
waltwhitman,"A breed whose proof is in time and deeds,"
waltwhitman,"What we are we are, nativity is answer enough to objections,"
waltwhitman,"We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,"
waltwhitman,"We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,"
waltwhitman,"We are executive in ourselves, we are sufficient in the variety of"
waltwhitman,"ourselves,"
waltwhitman,"We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves,"
waltwhitman,"We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world,"
waltwhitman,"From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn."
waltwhitman,"Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,"
waltwhitman,"Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or"
waltwhitman,sinful in ourselves only.
waltwhitman,(O Mother--O Sisters dear!
waltwhitman,"If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us,"
waltwhitman,It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)

waltwhitman,Have you thought there could be but a single supreme?
waltwhitman,There can be any number of supremes--one does not countervail another
waltwhitman,"any more than one eyesight countervails another, or one life"
waltwhitman,countervails another.
waltwhitman,"All is eligible to all,"

waltwhitman,"I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue, questioning every"
waltwhitman,"one I meet,"
waltwhitman,Who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew before?
waltwhitman,Who are you that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?
waltwhitman,"(With pangs and cries as thine own O bearer of many children,"
waltwhitman,These clamours wild to a race of pride I give.)
waltwhitman,"O lands, would you be freer than all that has ever been before?"
waltwhitman,"If you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to me."
waltwhitman,"Fear grace, elegance, civilization, delicatesse,"
waltwhitman,"Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey juice,"
waltwhitman,"Beware the advancing mortal ripening of Nature,"
waltwhitman,Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and men.
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,"
waltwhitman,"America brings builders, and brings its own styles."
waltwhitman,The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work and
waltwhitman,"pass'd to other spheres,"
waltwhitman,"A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done."
waltwhitman,"America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all"
waltwhitman,"hazards,"
waltwhitman,"Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound, initiates the true use of"
waltwhitman,"precedents,"
waltwhitman,Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced under their
waltwhitman,"forms,"
waltwhitman,"Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne"
waltwhitman,"from the house,"

waltwhitman,"approaches,"
waltwhitman,And that he shall be fittest for his days.

waltwhitman,Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the
waltwhitman,"day and night,"

waltwhitman,"Dismiss'd whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body,"
waltwhitman,Claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd for
waltwhitman,"others on the same terms,"
waltwhitman,"Sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every State"
waltwhitman,"(Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd to breathe his last,"
waltwhitman,"This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored,"
waltwhitman,To life recalling many a prostrate form);
waltwhitman,I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of
waltwhitman,"myself,"
waltwhitman,"Rejecting none, permitting all."
waltwhitman,"(Say O Mother, have I not to your thought been faithful?"
waltwhitman,Have I not through life kept you and yours before me?)
waltwhitman,15
waltwhitman,"I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things,"
waltwhitman,"It is not the earth, it is not America who is so great,"
waltwhitman,"It is I who am great or to be great, it is You up there, or any one,"
waltwhitman,"It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,"
waltwhitman,"Through poems, pageants, shows, to form individuals."
waltwhitman,"Underneath all, individuals,"
waltwhitman,"I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,"
waltwhitman,"The American compact is altogether with individuals,"
waltwhitman,"The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,"
waltwhitman,The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one single
waltwhitman,individual--namely to You.
waltwhitman,"(Mother! with subtle sense severe, with the naked sword in your hand,"
waltwhitman,I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)
waltwhitman,16
waltwhitman,"Underneath all, Nativity,"
waltwhitman,"I swear I will stand by my own nativity, pious or impious so be it;"
waltwhitman,I swear I am charm'd with nothing except nativity.
waltwhitman,"Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity."
waltwhitman,Underneath all is the Expression of love for men and women
waltwhitman,(I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing
waltwhitman,"love for men and women,"
waltwhitman,After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and
waltwhitman,women).
waltwhitman,I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself
waltwhitman,"(Talk as you like, he only suits these States whose manners favour the"
waltwhitman,audacity and sublime turbulence of the States).
waltwhitman,"Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,"
waltwhitman,"ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,"
waltwhitman,"Underneath all to me is myself, to you yourself (the same monotonous"
waltwhitman,old song).
waltwhitman,17
waltwhitman,"O I see flashing that this America is only you and me,"
waltwhitman,"Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,"
waltwhitman,"Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, are you and me,"
waltwhitman,"Its Congress is you and me, the officers, capitols, armies, ships,"
waltwhitman,"are you and me,"
waltwhitman,"Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,"
waltwhitman,"The war (that war so bloody and grim, the war I will henceforth"
waltwhitman,"forget) was you and me,"
waltwhitman,"Natural and artificial are you and me,"
waltwhitman,"Freedom, language, forms, employments, are you and me,"
waltwhitman,"Past, present, future, are you and me."
waltwhitman,"I dare not shirk any part of myself,"
waltwhitman,"Not any part of America good or bad,"
waltwhitman,"Not to build for that which builds for mankind,"
waltwhitman,"Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,"
waltwhitman,"Not to justify science nor the march of equality,"
waltwhitman,Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn belov'd of time.
waltwhitman,"I am for those that have never been master'd,"
waltwhitman,"For men and women whose tempers have never been master'd,"
waltwhitman,"For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master."
waltwhitman,"I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth,"
waltwhitman,Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all.
waltwhitman,"I will not be outfaced by irrational things,"
waltwhitman,"I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me,"
waltwhitman,"I will make cities and civilizations defer to me,"
waltwhitman,"This is what I have learnt from America--it is the amount, and it I"
waltwhitman,teach again.
waltwhitman,"(Democracy, while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,"
waltwhitman,"I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children, saw in dreams your"
waltwhitman,"dilating form,"
waltwhitman,Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)
waltwhitman,18
waltwhitman,"I will confront these shows of the day and night,"
waltwhitman,"I will know if I am to be less than they,"
waltwhitman,"I will see if I am not as majestic as they,"
waltwhitman,"I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they,"
waltwhitman,"I will see if I am to be less generous than they,"
waltwhitman,"I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have"
waltwhitman,"meaning,"
waltwhitman,"I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,"
waltwhitman,and I am not to be enough for myself.
waltwhitman,"I match my spirit against yours you orbs, growths, mountains, brutes,"
waltwhitman,"Copious as you are I absorb you all in myself, and become the master"
waltwhitman,"myself,"
waltwhitman,"America isolated yet embodying all, what is it finally except myself?"
waltwhitman,"These States, what are they except myself?"
waltwhitman,"I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked, it is for my"
waltwhitman,"sake,"
waltwhitman,"I take you specially to be mine, you terrible, rude forms."
waltwhitman,"(Mother, bend down, bend close to me your face,"
waltwhitman,"I know not what these plots and wars and deferments are for,"
waltwhitman,"I know not fruition's success, but I know that through war and crime"
waltwhitman,"your work goes on, and must yet go on.)"
waltwhitman,19
waltwhitman,"Thus by blue Ontario's shore,"
waltwhitman,"While the winds fann'd me and the waves came trooping toward me,"
waltwhitman,"I thrill'd with the power's pulsations, and the charm of my theme"
waltwhitman,"was upon me,"
waltwhitman,Till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me.
waltwhitman,"And I saw the free souls of poets,"
waltwhitman,"The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,"
waltwhitman,"Strange large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me."
waltwhitman,20
waltwhitman,"O my rapt verse, my call, mock me not!"
waltwhitman,"Not for the bards of the past, not to invoke them have I launch'd you"
waltwhitman,"forth,"
waltwhitman,"Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores,"
waltwhitman,Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song.
waltwhitman,Bards for my own land only I invoke
waltwhitman,"(For the war, the war is over, the field is clear'd),"
waltwhitman,"Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,"
waltwhitman,To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul.
waltwhitman,Bards of the great Idea! bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the
waltwhitman,"war, the war is over!)"
waltwhitman,"Yet bards of latent armies, a million soldiers waiting ever-ready,"
waltwhitman,Bards with songs as from burning coals or the lightning's fork'd
waltwhitman,stripes!
waltwhitman,"Ample Ohio's, Kanada's bards--bards of California! inland bards--bards"
waltwhitman,of the war!
waltwhitman,You by my charm I invoke.
waltwhitman,EPILOGUE
waltwhitman,RISE O DAYS FROM YOUR FATHOMLESS DEEPS
waltwhitman,RISE O DAYS FROM YOUR FATHOMLESS DEEPS
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Rise O days from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier, fiercer"
waltwhitman,"sweep,"
waltwhitman,"Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devour'd what the earth gave me,"
waltwhitman,"Long I roam'd the woods of the north, long I watch'd Niagara pouring,"
waltwhitman,"I travel'd the prairies over and slept on their breast, I cross'd the"
waltwhitman,"Nevadas, I cross'd the plateaus"
waltwhitman,"I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail'd out to sea,"
waltwhitman,"I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm"
waltwhitman,"I watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves,"
waltwhitman,"I mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high, curling over."
waltwhitman,"I heard the wind piping; I saw the black clouds,"
waltwhitman,"Saw from below what arose and mounted (O superb! O wild as my heart,"
waltwhitman,"and powerful!),"
waltwhitman,"Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow'd after the lightning,"
waltwhitman,Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and fast
waltwhitman,amid the din they chased each other across the sky;
waltwhitman,"These, and such as these, I, elate, saw--saw with wonder, yet pensive"
waltwhitman,"and masterful,"
waltwhitman,"All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,"
waltwhitman,"Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious."
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"'Twas well, O soul--'twas a good preparation you gave me,"
waltwhitman,"Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill,"
waltwhitman,"Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us,"
waltwhitman,"Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities,"
waltwhitman,"Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring,"
waltwhitman,Torrents of men (sources and rills of the Northwest are you indeed
waltwhitman,"inexhaustible?),"
waltwhitman,"What, to pavements and homesteads here, what were those storms of the"
waltwhitman,mountains and sea?
waltwhitman,"What, to passions I witness around me to-day? was the sea risen?"
waltwhitman,Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?
waltwhitman,"Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage,"
waltwhitman,"Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front--Cincinnati, Chicago,"
waltwhitman,unchain'd;
waltwhitman,"What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here,"
waltwhitman,How it climbs with daring feet and hands--how it dashes!
waltwhitman,How the true thunder bellows after the lightning--how bright the
waltwhitman,flashes of lightning!
waltwhitman,"How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through"
waltwhitman,the dark by those flashes of lightning!
waltwhitman,"(Yet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,"
waltwhitman,In a lull of the deafening confusion.)
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!"
waltwhitman,"And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities!"
waltwhitman,"Crash heavier, heavier yet O storms! you have done me good,"
waltwhitman,My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong
waltwhitman,"nutriment,"
waltwhitman,"Long had I walk'd my cities, my country roads through farms, only half"
waltwhitman,"satisfied,"
waltwhitman,"One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the ground"
waltwhitman,"before me,"
waltwhitman,"Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing"
waltwhitman,low;
waltwhitman,"The cities I loved so well I abandon'd and left, I sped to the"
waltwhitman,"certainties suitable to me,"
waltwhitman,"Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies and Nature's"
waltwhitman,"dauntlessness,"
waltwhitman,"I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only,"
waltwhitman,I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire--on the water and air I
waltwhitman,waited long;
waltwhitman,"But now I no longer wait, I am fully satisfied, I am glutted,"
waltwhitman,"I have witness'd the true lightning, I have witness'd my cities"
waltwhitman,"electric,"
waltwhitman,"I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise,"
waltwhitman,"Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,"
waltwhitman,No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea.
