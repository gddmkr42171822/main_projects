edgarallanpoe,INTRODUCTORY NOTE
edgarallanpoe,"UPON my return to the United States a few months ago, after the"
edgarallanpoe,"extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and elsewhere, of"
edgarallanpoe,"which an account is given in the following pages, accident threw me"
edgarallanpoe,"into the society of several gentlemen in Richmond, Va., who felt deep"
edgarallanpoe,"interest in all matters relating to the regions I had visited, and who"
edgarallanpoe,"were constantly urging it upon me, as a duty, to give my narrative to"
edgarallanpoe,"the public. I had several reasons, however, for declining to do so, some"
edgarallanpoe,"of which were of a nature altogether private, and concern no person but"
edgarallanpoe,myself; others not so much so. One consideration which deterred me was
edgarallanpoe,"that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in"
edgarallanpoe,"which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write, from mere"
edgarallanpoe,"memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have the _appearance"
edgarallanpoe,"_of that truth it would really possess, barring only the natural and"
edgarallanpoe,unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone when detailing
edgarallanpoe,events which have had powerful influence in exciting the imaginative
edgarallanpoe,"faculties. Another reason was, that the incidents to be narrated were"
edgarallanpoe,"of a nature so positively marvellous that, unsupported as my assertions"
edgarallanpoe,"must necessarily be (except by the evidence of a single individual, and"
edgarallanpoe,"he a half-breed Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family,"
edgarallanpoe,"and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put faith"
edgarallanpoe,in my veracity--the probability being that the public at large would
edgarallanpoe,regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent and ingenious
edgarallanpoe,"fiction. A distrust in my own abilities as a writer was, nevertheless,"
edgarallanpoe,one of the principal causes which prevented me from complying with the
edgarallanpoe,suggestions of my advisers.
edgarallanpoe,Among those gentlemen in Virginia who expressed the greatest interest
edgarallanpoe,"in my statement, more particularly in regard to that portion of it"
edgarallanpoe,"which related to the Antarctic Ocean, was Mr. Poe, lately editor of"
edgarallanpoe,"the “Southern Literary Messenger,” a monthly magazine, published by Mr."
edgarallanpoe,"Thomas W. White, in the city of Richmond. He strongly advised me,"
edgarallanpoe,"among others, to prepare at once a full account of what I had seen"
edgarallanpoe,"and undergone, and trust to the shrewdness and common-sense of the"
edgarallanpoe,"public--insisting, with great plausibility, that however roughly, as"
edgarallanpoe,"regards mere authorship, my book should be got up, its very uncouthness,"
edgarallanpoe,"if there were any, would give it all the better chance of being received"
edgarallanpoe,as truth.
edgarallanpoe,"Notwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to do as"
edgarallanpoe,he suggested. He afterward proposed (finding that I would not stir in
edgarallanpoe,"the matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in his own words, a"
edgarallanpoe,"narrative of the earlier portion of my adventures, from facts afforded"
edgarallanpoe,"by myself, publishing it in the “Southern Messenger” _under the garb"
edgarallanpoe,"of fiction. _To this, perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating"
edgarallanpoe,only that my real name should be retained. Two numbers of the pretended
edgarallanpoe,"fiction appeared, consequently, in the “Messenger” for January and"
edgarallanpoe,"February (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be regarded as"
edgarallanpoe,"fiction, the name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the articles in the table of"
edgarallanpoe,contents of the magazine.
edgarallanpoe,The manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at length to
edgarallanpoe,undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventures in
edgarallanpoe,"question; for I found that, in spite of the air of fable which had been"
edgarallanpoe,so ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which appeared
edgarallanpoe,"in the “Messenger” (without altering or distorting a single fact),"
edgarallanpoe,"the public were still not at all disposed to receive it as fable, and"
edgarallanpoe,"several letters were sent to Mr. P.’s address, distinctly expressing"
edgarallanpoe,a conviction to the contrary. I thence concluded that the facts of my
edgarallanpoe,narrative would prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient
edgarallanpoe,"evidence of their own authenticity, and that I had consequently little"
edgarallanpoe,to fear on the score of popular incredulity.
edgarallanpoe,"This_ exposé _being made, it will be seen at once how much of what"
edgarallanpoe,follows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be understood
edgarallanpoe,that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages which were written
edgarallanpoe,"by Mr. Poe. Even to those readers who have not seen the “Messenger,”"
edgarallanpoe,it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own
edgarallanpoe,commences; the difference in point of style will be readily perceived.
edgarallanpoe,A. G. PYM.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 1
edgarallanpoe,MY name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader in
edgarallanpoe,"sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal grandfather was"
edgarallanpoe,"an attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in every thing, and had"
edgarallanpoe,"speculated very successfully in stocks of the Edgarton New Bank, as it"
edgarallanpoe,was formerly called. By these and other means he had managed to lay by a
edgarallanpoe,"tolerable sum of money. He was more attached to myself, I believe, than"
edgarallanpoe,"to any other person in the world, and I expected to inherit the most"
edgarallanpoe,"of his property at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to"
edgarallanpoe,"the school of old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of"
edgarallanpoe,eccentric manners--he is well known to almost every person who has
edgarallanpoe,"visited New Bedford. I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I"
edgarallanpoe,left him for Mr. E. Ronald’s academy on the hill. Here I became intimate
edgarallanpoe,"with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who generally sailed in the"
edgarallanpoe,employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh--Mr. Barnard is also very well known in
edgarallanpoe,"New Bedford, and has many relations, I am certain, in Edgarton. His son"
edgarallanpoe,"was named Augustus, and he was nearly two years older than myself. He"
edgarallanpoe,"had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and"
edgarallanpoe,was always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific Ocean.
edgarallanpoe,"I used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day, and sometimes"
edgarallanpoe,"all night. We occupied the same bed, and he would be sure to keep me"
edgarallanpoe,"awake until almost light, telling me stories of the natives of the"
edgarallanpoe,"Island of Tinian, and other places he had visited in his travels. At"
edgarallanpoe,"last I could not help being interested in what he said, and by degrees"
edgarallanpoe,I felt the greatest desire to go to sea. I owned a sailboat called the
edgarallanpoe,"Ariel, and worth about seventy-five dollars. She had a half-deck or"
edgarallanpoe,"cuddy, and was rigged sloop-fashion--I forget her tonnage, but she would"
edgarallanpoe,hold ten persons without much crowding. In this boat we were in the
edgarallanpoe,"habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I"
edgarallanpoe,"now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am alive"
edgarallanpoe,to-day.
edgarallanpoe,I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a
edgarallanpoe,longer and more momentous narrative. One night there was a party at Mr.
edgarallanpoe,"Barnard’s, and both Augustus and myself were not a little intoxicated"
edgarallanpoe,"toward the close of it. As usual, in such cases, I took part of his"
edgarallanpoe,"bed in preference to going home. He went to sleep, as I thought, very"
edgarallanpoe,"quietly (it being near one when the party broke up), and without saying"
edgarallanpoe,a word on his favorite topic. It might have been half an hour from the
edgarallanpoe,"time of our getting in bed, and I was just about falling into a doze,"
edgarallanpoe,"when he suddenly started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he"
edgarallanpoe,"would not go to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was"
edgarallanpoe,so glorious a breeze from the southwest. I never was so astonished in
edgarallanpoe,"my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the wines and"
edgarallanpoe,liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside himself. He proceeded
edgarallanpoe,"to talk very coolly, however, saying he knew that I supposed him"
edgarallanpoe,"intoxicated, but that he was never more sober in his life. He was only"
edgarallanpoe,"tired, he added, of lying in bed on such a fine night like a dog, and"
edgarallanpoe,"was determined to get up and dress, and go out on a frolic with the"
edgarallanpoe,"boat. I can hardly tell what possessed me, but the words were no sooner"
edgarallanpoe,out of his mouth than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and
edgarallanpoe,"pleasure, and thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most"
edgarallanpoe,"reasonable things in the world. It was blowing almost a gale, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"weather was very cold--it being late in October. I sprang out of bed,"
edgarallanpoe,"nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was quite as brave"
edgarallanpoe,"as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed like a dog,"
edgarallanpoe,and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any Augustus Barnard in
edgarallanpoe,Nantucket.
edgarallanpoe,We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the boat.
edgarallanpoe,She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the lumber-yard of Pankey &
edgarallanpoe,"Co., and almost thumping her side out against the rough logs. Augustus"
edgarallanpoe,"got into her and bailed her, for she was nearly half full of water. This"
edgarallanpoe,"being done, we hoisted jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly"
edgarallanpoe,out to sea.
edgarallanpoe,"The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. The night"
edgarallanpoe,"was very clear and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I stationed"
edgarallanpoe,"myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew along at a great"
edgarallanpoe,rate--neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the
edgarallanpoe,"wharf. I now asked my companion what course he intended to steer, and"
edgarallanpoe,what time he thought it probable we should get back. He whistled for a
edgarallanpoe,"few minutes, and then said crustily: “_I_ am going to sea--_you_ may go"
edgarallanpoe,"home if you think proper.” Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once"
edgarallanpoe,"that, in spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated."
edgarallanpoe,I could see him distinctly by the light of the moon--his face was
edgarallanpoe,"paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he could"
edgarallanpoe,scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something had gone
edgarallanpoe,"wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I knew little"
edgarallanpoe,"about the management of a boat, and was now depending entirely upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had suddenly increased, as"
edgarallanpoe,we were fast getting out of the lee of the land--still I was ashamed
edgarallanpoe,"to betray any trepidation, and for almost half an hour maintained a"
edgarallanpoe,"resolute silence. I could stand it no longer, however, and spoke to"
edgarallanpoe,"Augustus about the propriety of turning back. As before, it was nearly"
edgarallanpoe,"a minute before he made answer, or took any notice of my suggestion."
edgarallanpoe,"“By-and-by,” said he at length--“time enough--home by-and-by.” I had"
edgarallanpoe,"expected a similar reply, but there was something in the tone of these"
edgarallanpoe,words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again
edgarallanpoe,"looked at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and"
edgarallanpoe,his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to
edgarallanpoe,"stand. “For God’s sake, Augustus,” I screamed, now heartily frightened,"
edgarallanpoe,“what ails you?--what is the matter?--what _are_ you going to do?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Matter!” he stammered, in the greatest apparent surprise, letting go"
edgarallanpoe,"the tiller at the same moment, and falling forward into the bottom of"
edgarallanpoe,"the boat--“matter--why, nothing is the--matter--going home--d--d--don’t"
edgarallanpoe,you see?” The whole truth now flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised
edgarallanpoe,"him up. He was drunk--beastly drunk--he could no longer either stand,"
edgarallanpoe,"speak, or see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go"
edgarallanpoe,"in the extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the"
edgarallanpoe,"bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that, during"
edgarallanpoe,"the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and that his"
edgarallanpoe,conduct in bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated state of
edgarallanpoe,"intoxication--a state which, like madness, frequently enables the victim"
edgarallanpoe,to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his
edgarallanpoe,"senses. The coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual"
edgarallanpoe,effect--the mental energy began to yield before its influence--and the
edgarallanpoe,confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation
edgarallanpoe,had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now thoroughly
edgarallanpoe,"insensible, and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for"
edgarallanpoe,many hours.
edgarallanpoe,It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The fumes
edgarallanpoe,"of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly timid and"
edgarallanpoe,irresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of managing the
edgarallanpoe,"boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide were hurrying us to"
edgarallanpoe,destruction. A storm was evidently gathering behind us; we had neither
edgarallanpoe,"compass nor provisions; and it was clear that, if we held our present"
edgarallanpoe,"course, we should be out of sight of land before daybreak. These"
edgarallanpoe,"thoughts, with a crowd of others equally fearful, flashed through my"
edgarallanpoe,"mind with a bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me"
edgarallanpoe,beyond the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going
edgarallanpoe,through the water at a terrible rate--full before the wind--no reef in
edgarallanpoe,either jib or mainsail--running her bows completely under the foam. It
edgarallanpoe,was a thousand wonders she did not broach to--Augustus having let go
edgarallanpoe,"the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much agitated to think of"
edgarallanpoe,"taking it myself. By good luck, however, she kept steady, and gradually"
edgarallanpoe,I recovered some degree of presence of mind. Still the wind was
edgarallanpoe,"increasing fearfully, and whenever we rose from a plunge forward, the"
edgarallanpoe,"sea behind fell combing over our counter, and deluged us with water. I"
edgarallanpoe,"was so utterly benumbed, too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious"
edgarallanpoe,"of sensation. At length I summoned up the resolution of despair,"
edgarallanpoe,and rushing to the mainsail let it go by the run. As might have been
edgarallanpoe,"expected, it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water,"
edgarallanpoe,carried away the mast short off by the board. This latter accident alone
edgarallanpoe,"saved me from instant destruction. Under the jib only, I now boomed"
edgarallanpoe,"along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally over the"
edgarallanpoe,"counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate death. I took the"
edgarallanpoe,"helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I found that there yet"
edgarallanpoe,remained to us a chance of ultimate escape. Augustus still lay senseless
edgarallanpoe,in the bottom of the boat; and as there was imminent danger of his
edgarallanpoe,"drowning (the water being nearly a foot deep just where he fell), I"
edgarallanpoe,"contrived to raise him partially up, and keep him in a sitting position,"
edgarallanpoe,"by passing a rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the"
edgarallanpoe,deck of the cuddy. Having thus arranged every thing as well as I could
edgarallanpoe,"in my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended myself to God, and"
edgarallanpoe,made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the fortitude in
edgarallanpoe,my power.
edgarallanpoe,"Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and long"
edgarallanpoe,"scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons, seemed to"
edgarallanpoe,pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat. Never while I
edgarallanpoe,live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I experienced at that
edgarallanpoe,moment. My hair stood erect on my head--I felt the blood congealing
edgarallanpoe,"in my veins--my heart ceased utterly to beat, and without having once"
edgarallanpoe,"raised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm, I tumbled headlong and"
edgarallanpoe,insensible upon the body of my fallen companion.
edgarallanpoe,"I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large whaling-ship (the"
edgarallanpoe,"Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons were standing over me, and"
edgarallanpoe,"Augustus, paler than death, was busily occupied in chafing my hands."
edgarallanpoe,"Upon seeing me open my eyes, his exclamations of gratitude and joy"
edgarallanpoe,excited alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking personages
edgarallanpoe,who were present. The mystery of our being in existence was now
edgarallanpoe,"soon explained. We had been run down by the whaling-ship, which was"
edgarallanpoe,"close-hauled, beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture"
edgarallanpoe,"to set, and consequently running almost at right angles to our own"
edgarallanpoe,"course. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not perceive"
edgarallanpoe,our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in contact--their
edgarallanpoe,shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me. The
edgarallanpoe,"huge ship, I was told, rode immediately over us with as much ease as"
edgarallanpoe,"our own little vessel would have passed over a feather, and without the"
edgarallanpoe,least perceptible impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from
edgarallanpoe,the deck of the victim--there was a slight grating sound to be heard
edgarallanpoe,"mingling with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was"
edgarallanpoe,swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her destroyer--but
edgarallanpoe,this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be remembered was
edgarallanpoe,"dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless, the captain (Captain"
edgarallanpoe,"E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for proceeding on his course without"
edgarallanpoe,"troubling himself further about the matter. Luckily, there were two"
edgarallanpoe,of the look-out who swore positively to having seen some person at our
edgarallanpoe,"helm, and represented the possibility of yet saving him. A discussion"
edgarallanpoe,"ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it was no"
edgarallanpoe,business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells; that the ship
edgarallanpoe,should not put about for any such nonsense; and if there was a man run
edgarallanpoe,"down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he might drown and be dammed”"
edgarallanpoe,"or some language to that effect. Henderson, the first mate, now took the"
edgarallanpoe,"matter up, being justly indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew,"
edgarallanpoe,at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity. He
edgarallanpoe,"spoke plainly, seeing himself upheld by the men, told the captain he"
edgarallanpoe,"considered him a fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey"
edgarallanpoe,his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore.
edgarallanpoe,"He strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer)"
edgarallanpoe,"on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm voice,"
edgarallanpoe,"Hard-a-lee! The men flew to their posts, and the ship went cleverly"
edgarallanpoe,"about. All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it was supposed to"
edgarallanpoe,be hardly within the bounds of possibility that any individual could be
edgarallanpoe,"saved--allowing any to have been on board the boat. Yet, as the reader"
edgarallanpoe,"has seen, both Augustus and myself were rescued; and our deliverance"
edgarallanpoe,seemed to have been brought about by two of those almost inconceivable
edgarallanpoe,pieces of good fortune which are attributed by the wise and pious to the
edgarallanpoe,special interference of Providence.
edgarallanpoe,"While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and"
edgarallanpoe,"jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke up as having"
edgarallanpoe,seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of the vessel (the moon
edgarallanpoe,"still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward,"
edgarallanpoe,"and Henderson, at the same moment, starting up in his seat bawled out"
edgarallanpoe,to his crew to back water. He would say nothing else--repeating his cry
edgarallanpoe,"impatiently, back water! back water! The men put back as speedily as"
edgarallanpoe,"possible, but by this time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully"
edgarallanpoe,"under headway, although all hands on board were making great exertions"
edgarallanpoe,"to take in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung"
edgarallanpoe,to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another huge
edgarallanpoe,lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly
edgarallanpoe,"as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious"
edgarallanpoe,enough. The body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular
edgarallanpoe,manner to the smooth and shining bottom (the Penguin was coppered and
edgarallanpoe,"copper-fastened), and beating violently against it with every movement"
edgarallanpoe,"of the hull. After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches"
edgarallanpoe,"of the ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally"
edgarallanpoe,disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board--for the body
edgarallanpoe,proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the timber-bolts having
edgarallanpoe,"started and broken a passage through the copper, it had arrested my"
edgarallanpoe,"progress as I passed under the ship, and fastened me in so extraordinary"
edgarallanpoe,a manner to her bottom. The head of the bolt had made its way through
edgarallanpoe,"the collar of the green baize jacket I had on, and through the back part"
edgarallanpoe,"of my neck, forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the"
edgarallanpoe,right ear. I was immediately put to bed--although life seemed to be
edgarallanpoe,"totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"treated me with every attention--to make amends, I presume, in the eyes"
edgarallanpoe,"of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the"
edgarallanpoe,adventure.
edgarallanpoe,"In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship, although"
edgarallanpoe,the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not been gone many
edgarallanpoe,"minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat, and shortly"
edgarallanpoe,afterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a
edgarallanpoe,cry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest. This induced
edgarallanpoe,the hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an
edgarallanpoe,"hour, although repeated signals to return were made them by Captain"
edgarallanpoe,"Block, and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was"
edgarallanpoe,"fraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is"
edgarallanpoe,nearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could
edgarallanpoe,"have escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since had reason to"
edgarallanpoe,"believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some life-boats used on the"
edgarallanpoe,coast of Wales.
edgarallanpoe,"After searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned,"
edgarallanpoe,it was determined to get back to the ship. They had scarcely made this
edgarallanpoe,resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object that floated rapidly
edgarallanpoe,by. They pursued and soon overtook it. It proved to be the entire deck
edgarallanpoe,"of the Ariel’s cuddy. Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the"
edgarallanpoe,last agonies. Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached
edgarallanpoe,"by a rope to the floating timber. This rope, it will be remembered, I"
edgarallanpoe,"had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt, for"
edgarallanpoe,"the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so doing,"
edgarallanpoe,"it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving his life. The"
edgarallanpoe,"Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down her frame naturally"
edgarallanpoe,"went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as might have been expected, was"
edgarallanpoe,"lifted, by the force of the water rushing in, entirely from the"
edgarallanpoe,"main timbers, and floated (with other fragments, no doubt) to the"
edgarallanpoe,"surface--Augustus was buoyed up with it, and thus escaped a terrible"
edgarallanpoe,death.
edgarallanpoe,It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin before
edgarallanpoe,"he could give any account of himself, or be made to comprehend the"
edgarallanpoe,nature of the accident which had befallen our boat. At length he became
edgarallanpoe,"thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of his sensations while in the water."
edgarallanpoe,"Upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness, he found himself"
edgarallanpoe,"beneath the surface, whirling round and round with inconceivable"
edgarallanpoe,"rapidity, and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about"
edgarallanpoe,"his neck. In an instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward,"
edgarallanpoe,"when, his head striking violently against a hard substance, he again"
edgarallanpoe,relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more reviving he was in fuller
edgarallanpoe,"possession of his reason--this was still, however, in the greatest"
edgarallanpoe,degree clouded and confused. He now knew that some accident had
edgarallanpoe,"occurred, and that he was in the water, although his mouth was above"
edgarallanpoe,"the surface, and he could breathe with some freedom. Possibly, at this"
edgarallanpoe,"period the deck was drifting rapidly before the wind, and drawing him"
edgarallanpoe,"after it, as he floated upon his back. Of course, as long as he could"
edgarallanpoe,"have retained this position, it would have been nearly impossible that"
edgarallanpoe,he should be drowned. Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the
edgarallanpoe,"deck, and this post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals"
edgarallanpoe,"for help. Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been"
edgarallanpoe,"obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into the sea,"
edgarallanpoe,had given himself up for lost. During the whole period of his struggles
edgarallanpoe,"he had not the faintest recollection of the Ariel, nor of the matters in"
edgarallanpoe,connexion with the source of his disaster. A vague feeling of terror
edgarallanpoe,and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties. When he was
edgarallanpoe,"finally picked up, every power of his mind had failed him; and, as"
edgarallanpoe,"before said, it was nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin"
edgarallanpoe,before he became fully aware of his condition. In regard to myself--I
edgarallanpoe,was resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and
edgarallanpoe,after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a
edgarallanpoe,half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot oil--a proceeding
edgarallanpoe,"suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck, although of an ugly"
edgarallanpoe,"appearance, proved of little real consequence, and I soon recovered from"
edgarallanpoe,its effects.
edgarallanpoe,"The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning, after"
edgarallanpoe,encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off Nantucket.
edgarallanpoe,Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr. Barnard’s in time for
edgarallanpoe,"breakfast--which, luckily, was somewhat late, owing to the party over"
edgarallanpoe,night. I suppose all at the table were too much fatigued themselves to
edgarallanpoe,"notice our jaded appearance--of course, it would not have borne a very"
edgarallanpoe,"rigid scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way"
edgarallanpoe,"of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in Nantucket"
edgarallanpoe,had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some sailors
edgarallanpoe,in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned some thirty
edgarallanpoe,"or forty poor devils, had reference either to the Ariel, my companion,"
edgarallanpoe,or myself. We two have since very frequently talked the matter over--but
edgarallanpoe,never without a shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly
edgarallanpoe,"confessed to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced"
edgarallanpoe,"so excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat"
edgarallanpoe,"he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt himself"
edgarallanpoe,sinking beneath its influence.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 2
edgarallanpoe,"IN no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce inferences"
edgarallanpoe,"with entire certainty, even from the most simple data. It might be"
edgarallanpoe,supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just related would have
edgarallanpoe,"effectually cooled my incipient passion for the sea. On the contrary, I"
edgarallanpoe,never experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures incident
edgarallanpoe,to the life of a navigator than within a week after our miraculous
edgarallanpoe,deliverance. This short period proved amply long enough to erase from
edgarallanpoe,"my memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the pleasurably"
edgarallanpoe,"exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of the late perilous"
edgarallanpoe,accident. My conversations with Augustus grew daily more frequent and
edgarallanpoe,more intensely full of interest. He had a manner of relating his stories
edgarallanpoe,of the ocean (more than one half of which I now suspect to have
edgarallanpoe,been sheer fabrications) well adapted to have weight with one of
edgarallanpoe,my enthusiastic temperament and somewhat gloomy although glowing
edgarallanpoe,"imagination. It is strange, too, that he most strongly enlisted my"
edgarallanpoe,"feelings in behalf of the life of a seaman, when he depicted his more"
edgarallanpoe,terrible moments of suffering and despair. For the bright side of the
edgarallanpoe,painting I had a limited sympathy. My visions were of shipwreck and
edgarallanpoe,famine; of death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime
edgarallanpoe,"dragged out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in"
edgarallanpoe,an ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires--for they
edgarallanpoe,"amounted to desires--are common, I have since been assured, to the whole"
edgarallanpoe,numerous race of the melancholy among men--at the time of which I speak
edgarallanpoe,I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses of a destiny which I felt
edgarallanpoe,myself in a measure bound to fulfil. Augustus thoroughly entered into my
edgarallanpoe,"state of mind. It is probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had"
edgarallanpoe,resulted in a partial interchange of character.
edgarallanpoe,"About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel’s disaster, the"
edgarallanpoe,firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some manner with the
edgarallanpoe,"Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were engaged in repairing"
edgarallanpoe,and fitting out the brig Grampus for a whaling voyage. She was an old
edgarallanpoe,"hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when all was done to her that could be"
edgarallanpoe,done. I hardly know why she was chosen in preference to other good
edgarallanpoe,vessels belonging to the same owners--but so it was. Mr. Barnard was
edgarallanpoe,"appointed to command her, and Augustus was going with him. While the"
edgarallanpoe,"brig was getting ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of"
edgarallanpoe,the opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He found
edgarallanpoe,me by no means an unwilling listener--yet the matter could not be so
edgarallanpoe,easily arranged. My father made no direct opposition; but my mother went
edgarallanpoe,"into hysterics at the bare mention of the design; and, more than all,"
edgarallanpoe,"my grandfather, from whom I expected much, vowed to cut me off with"
edgarallanpoe,a shilling if I should ever broach the subject to him again. These
edgarallanpoe,"difficulties, however, so far from abating my desire, only added fuel to"
edgarallanpoe,"the flame. I determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my"
edgarallanpoe,"intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it"
edgarallanpoe,might be accomplished. In the meantime I forbore speaking to any of my
edgarallanpoe,"relations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself ostensibly"
edgarallanpoe,"with my usual studies, it was supposed that I had abandoned the design."
edgarallanpoe,I have since frequently examined my conduct on this occasion with
edgarallanpoe,sentiments of displeasure as well as of surprise. The intense hypocrisy
edgarallanpoe,I made use of for the furtherance of my project--an hypocrisy pervading
edgarallanpoe,every word and action of my life for so long a period of time--could
edgarallanpoe,only have been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning
edgarallanpoe,expectation with which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my
edgarallanpoe,long-cherished visions of travel.
edgarallanpoe,"In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged to"
edgarallanpoe,"leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for the"
edgarallanpoe,"greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to some"
edgarallanpoe,"arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. At night,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over our hopes."
edgarallanpoe,"After nearly a month passed in this manner, without our hitting upon"
edgarallanpoe,"any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told me at last that he had"
edgarallanpoe,determined upon everything necessary. I had a relation living in New
edgarallanpoe,"Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house I was in the habit of spending"
edgarallanpoe,occasionally two or three weeks at a time. The brig was to sail about
edgarallanpoe,"the middle of June (June, 1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two"
edgarallanpoe,"before her putting to sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual,"
edgarallanpoe,"from Mr. Ross, asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert"
edgarallanpoe,and Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself with the inditing of
edgarallanpoe,"this note and getting it delivered. Having set out as supposed, for New"
edgarallanpoe,"Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who would contrive"
edgarallanpoe,"a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This hiding-place, he assured me,"
edgarallanpoe,would be rendered sufficiently comfortable for a residence of many
edgarallanpoe,"days, during which I was not to make my appearance. When the brig had"
edgarallanpoe,proceeded so far on her course as to make any turning back a matter out
edgarallanpoe,"of question, I should then, he said, be formally installed in all"
edgarallanpoe,"the comforts of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh"
edgarallanpoe,heartily at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter
edgarallanpoe,might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.
edgarallanpoe,"The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been matured."
edgarallanpoe,"The note was written and delivered, and on a Monday morning I left the"
edgarallanpoe,"house for the New Bedford packet, as supposed. I went, however, straight"
edgarallanpoe,"to Augustus, who was waiting for me at the corner of a street. It had"
edgarallanpoe,"been our original plan that I should keep out of the way until dark, and"
edgarallanpoe,"then slip on board the brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our"
edgarallanpoe,"favor, it was agreed to lose no time in secreting me. Augustus led the"
edgarallanpoe,"way to the wharf, and I followed at a little distance, enveloped in a"
edgarallanpoe,"thick seaman’s cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my person"
edgarallanpoe,"might not be easily recognized. Just as we turned the second corner,"
edgarallanpoe,"after passing Mr. Edmund’s well, who should appear, standing right in"
edgarallanpoe,"front of me, and looking me full in the face, but old Mr. Peterson, my"
edgarallanpoe,"grandfather. “Why, bless my soul, Gordon,” said he, after a long pause,"
edgarallanpoe,"“why, why,--whose dirty cloak is that you have on?” “Sir!” I replied,"
edgarallanpoe,"assuming, as well as I could, in the exigency of the moment, an air"
edgarallanpoe,"of offended surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable"
edgarallanpoe,"tones--“sir! you are a sum’mat mistaken--my name, in the first place,"
edgarallanpoe,"bee’nt nothing at all like Goddin, and I’d want you for to know better,"
edgarallanpoe,"you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty one.” For my life"
edgarallanpoe,I could hardly refrain from screaming with laughter at the odd manner in
edgarallanpoe,which the old gentleman received this handsome rebuke. He started back
edgarallanpoe,"two or three steps, turned first pale and then excessively red, threw up"
edgarallanpoe,"his spectacles, then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with"
edgarallanpoe,"his umbrella uplifted. He stopped short, however, in his career, as if"
edgarallanpoe,"struck with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled"
edgarallanpoe,"off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and muttering"
edgarallanpoe,between his teeth: “Won’t do--new glasses--thought it was Gordon--d--d
edgarallanpoe,good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom.”
edgarallanpoe,"After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and arrived"
edgarallanpoe,at our point of destination in safety. There were only one or two of
edgarallanpoe,"the hands on board, and these were busy forward, doing something to the"
edgarallanpoe,"forecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we knew very well, was engaged"
edgarallanpoe,"at Lloyd and Vredenburgh’s, and would remain there until late in the"
edgarallanpoe,"evening, so we had little to apprehend on his account. Augustus went"
edgarallanpoe,"first up the vessel’s side, and in a short while I followed him, without"
edgarallanpoe,"being noticed by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the cabin,"
edgarallanpoe,and found no person there. It was fitted up in the most comfortable
edgarallanpoe,style--a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There were four
edgarallanpoe,"very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths. There was"
edgarallanpoe,"also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably thick and valuable"
edgarallanpoe,carpet covering the floor of both the cabin and staterooms. The ceiling
edgarallanpoe,"was full seven feet high, and, in short, every thing appeared of a more"
edgarallanpoe,"roomy and agreeable nature than I had anticipated. Augustus, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"would allow me but little time for observation, insisting upon the"
edgarallanpoe,necessity of my concealing myself as soon as possible. He led the way
edgarallanpoe,"into his own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and"
edgarallanpoe,"next to the bulkheads. Upon entering, he closed the door and bolted it."
edgarallanpoe,I thought I had never seen a nicer little room than the one in which I
edgarallanpoe,"now found myself. It was about ten feet long, and had only one berth,"
edgarallanpoe,"which, as I said before, was wide and convenient. In that portion of"
edgarallanpoe,"the closet nearest the bulkheads there was a space of four feet square,"
edgarallanpoe,"containing a table, a chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books,"
edgarallanpoe,chiefly books of voyages and travels. There were many other little
edgarallanpoe,"comforts in the room, among which I ought not to forget a kind of"
edgarallanpoe,"safe or refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of"
edgarallanpoe,"delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department."
edgarallanpoe,He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the carpet in
edgarallanpoe,"one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know that a portion"
edgarallanpoe,"of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had been neatly cut out"
edgarallanpoe,"and again adjusted. As he pressed, this portion rose up at one end"
edgarallanpoe,sufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath. In this manner
edgarallanpoe,he raised the mouth of the trap (to which the carpet was still fastened
edgarallanpoe,"by tacks), and I found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a"
edgarallanpoe,"small taper by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a"
edgarallanpoe,"dark lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me follow."
edgarallanpoe,"I did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by means of a nail"
edgarallanpoe,"driven into the under side--the carpet, of course, resuming its original"
edgarallanpoe,"position on the floor of the stateroom, and all traces of the aperture"
edgarallanpoe,being concealed.
edgarallanpoe,The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest
edgarallanpoe,difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber
edgarallanpoe,"among which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my eyes became"
edgarallanpoe,"accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less trouble, holding"
edgarallanpoe,"on to the skirts of my friend’s coat. He brought me, at length,"
edgarallanpoe,"after creeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages, to an"
edgarallanpoe,"iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware."
edgarallanpoe,"It was nearly four feet high, and full six long, but very narrow. Two"
edgarallanpoe,"large empty oil-casks lay on the top of it, and above these, again, a"
edgarallanpoe,"vast quantity of straw matting, piled up as high as the floor of"
edgarallanpoe,the cabin. In every other direction around was wedged as closely as
edgarallanpoe,"possible, even up to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every"
edgarallanpoe,"species of ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of"
edgarallanpoe,"crates, hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less"
edgarallanpoe,than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the box. I
edgarallanpoe,afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the stowage in this
edgarallanpoe,"hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment, having had only"
edgarallanpoe,"one assistant in the labour, a man not going out in the brig."
edgarallanpoe,My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be
edgarallanpoe,"removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at"
edgarallanpoe,which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one of the cabin berths
edgarallanpoe,"covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article"
edgarallanpoe,"of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing"
edgarallanpoe,"me, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a"
edgarallanpoe,"sitting position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were"
edgarallanpoe,"some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of"
edgarallanpoe,"water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna sausages, an"
edgarallanpoe,"enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of"
edgarallanpoe,cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately to take possession of my
edgarallanpoe,"little apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, I am"
edgarallanpoe,"sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace."
edgarallanpoe,Augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end
edgarallanpoe,"of the box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a"
edgarallanpoe,"piece of dark whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my"
edgarallanpoe,"hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber, to a"
edgarallanpoe,"nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the"
edgarallanpoe,trap-door leading into his stateroom. By means of this cord I should be
edgarallanpoe,"enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any"
edgarallanpoe,unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. He now took
edgarallanpoe,"his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious"
edgarallanpoe,"supply of tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as"
edgarallanpoe,often as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on the
edgarallanpoe,seventeenth of June.
edgarallanpoe,I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in my
edgarallanpoe,"hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice for the"
edgarallanpoe,purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just
edgarallanpoe,opposite the opening. During the whole period I saw nothing of Augustus;
edgarallanpoe,"but this occasioned me little uneasiness, as I knew the brig was"
edgarallanpoe,"expected to put to sea every hour, and in the bustle he would not easily"
edgarallanpoe,find opportunities of coming down to me. At length I heard the trap
edgarallanpoe,"open and shut, and presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was"
edgarallanpoe,"well, and if there was any thing I wanted. “Nothing,” I replied; “I am"
edgarallanpoe,as comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “She will be under
edgarallanpoe,"weigh in less than half an hour,” he answered. “I came to let you know,"
edgarallanpoe,and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I shall not have a
edgarallanpoe,chance of coming down again for some time--perhaps for three or four
edgarallanpoe,days more. All is going on right aboveboard. After I go up and close the
edgarallanpoe,"trap, do you creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in."
edgarallanpoe,"You will find my watch there--it may be useful to you, as you have no"
edgarallanpoe,daylight to keep time by. I suppose you can’t tell how long you have
edgarallanpoe,been buried--only three days--this is the twentieth. I would bring the
edgarallanpoe,"watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed.” With this he went up."
edgarallanpoe,"In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in motion,"
edgarallanpoe,and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced a
edgarallanpoe,"voyage. Satisfied with this idea, I determined to make my mind as easy"
edgarallanpoe,"as possible, and await the course of events until I should be"
edgarallanpoe,"permitted to exchange the box for the more roomy, although hardly more"
edgarallanpoe,"comfortable, accommodations of the cabin. My first care was to get the"
edgarallanpoe,"watch. Leaving the taper burning, I groped along in the dark, following"
edgarallanpoe,"the cord through windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered"
edgarallanpoe,"that, after toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot or"
edgarallanpoe,"two of a former position. At length I reached the nail, and securing the"
edgarallanpoe,"object of my journey, returned with it in safety. I now looked over"
edgarallanpoe,"the books which had been so thoughtfully provided, and selected the"
edgarallanpoe,expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of the Columbia. With this
edgarallanpoe,"I amused myself for some time, when, growing sleepy, I extinguished the"
edgarallanpoe,"light with great care, and soon fell into a sound slumber."
edgarallanpoe,"Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time elapsed"
edgarallanpoe,before I could bring to recollection all the various circumstances of
edgarallanpoe,"my situation. By degrees, however, I remembered all. Striking a light, I"
edgarallanpoe,"looked at the watch; but it was run down, and there were, consequently,"
edgarallanpoe,"no means of determining how long I slept. My limbs were greatly cramped,"
edgarallanpoe,and I was forced to relieve them by standing between the crates.
edgarallanpoe,"Presently feeling an almost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the"
edgarallanpoe,"cold mutton, some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and"
edgarallanpoe,found excellent. What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a
edgarallanpoe,state of absolute putrefaction! This circumstance occasioned me great
edgarallanpoe,"disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I experienced"
edgarallanpoe,"upon awakening, I began to suppose that I must have slept for an"
edgarallanpoe,inordinately long period of time. The close atmosphere of the hold might
edgarallanpoe,"have had something to do with this, and might, in the end, be productive"
edgarallanpoe,of the most serious results. My head ached excessively; I fancied that I
edgarallanpoe,"drew every breath with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with"
edgarallanpoe,a multitude of gloomy feelings. Still I could not venture to make any
edgarallanpoe,"disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound up the"
edgarallanpoe,"watch, contented myself as well as possible."
edgarallanpoe,Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no person
edgarallanpoe,"came to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus of the"
edgarallanpoe,"grossest inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that the water in"
edgarallanpoe,"my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was suffering much from"
edgarallanpoe,"thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna sausages after the loss of my"
edgarallanpoe,"mutton. I became very uneasy, and could no longer take any interest in"
edgarallanpoe,"my books. I was overpowered, too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled"
edgarallanpoe,"at the thought of indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious"
edgarallanpoe,"influence, like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the"
edgarallanpoe,hold. In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in
edgarallanpoe,"the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears as if"
edgarallanpoe,"from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was blowing. I"
edgarallanpoe,could not imagine a reason for the absence of Augustus. We were surely
edgarallanpoe,far enough advanced on our voyage to allow of my going up. Some accident
edgarallanpoe,might have happened to him--but I could think of none which would
edgarallanpoe,"account for his suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except,"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed, his having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea"
edgarallanpoe,I could not dwell with any degree of patience. It was possible that we
edgarallanpoe,"had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near vicinity of"
edgarallanpoe,"Nantucket. This notion, however, I was forced to abandon; for such being"
edgarallanpoe,"the case, the brig must have frequently gone about; and I was entirely"
edgarallanpoe,"satisfied, from her continual inclination to the larboard, that she had"
edgarallanpoe,been sailing all along with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter.
edgarallanpoe,"Besides, granting that we were still in the neighborhood of the"
edgarallanpoe,"island, why should not Augustus have visited me and informed me of"
edgarallanpoe,the circumstance? Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of
edgarallanpoe,"my solitary and cheerless condition, I resolved to wait yet another"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty-four hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would make my way"
edgarallanpoe,"to the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend,"
edgarallanpoe,"or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a further"
edgarallanpoe,"supply of water from the stateroom. While occupied with this thought,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the contrary, into a state"
edgarallanpoe,"of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My dreams were of the most terrific"
edgarallanpoe,description. Every species of calamity and horror befell me. Among other
edgarallanpoe,"miseries I was smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of"
edgarallanpoe,the most ghastly and ferocious aspect. Immense serpents held me in their
edgarallanpoe,"embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully shining"
edgarallanpoe,"eyes. Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn and awe-inspiring"
edgarallanpoe,"character, spread themselves out before me. Immensely tall trunks of"
edgarallanpoe,"trees, gray and leafless, rose up in endless succession as far as the"
edgarallanpoe,"eye could reach. Their roots were concealed in wide-spreading morasses,"
edgarallanpoe,"whose dreary water lay intensely black, still, and altogether terrible,"
edgarallanpoe,"beneath. And the strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and"
edgarallanpoe,"waving to and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters"
edgarallanpoe,"for mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony"
edgarallanpoe,"and despair. The scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone, amidst the"
edgarallanpoe,burning sand-plains of Sahara. At my feet lay crouched a fierce lion
edgarallanpoe,of the tropics. Suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me. With
edgarallanpoe,"a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet, and laid bare his horrible"
edgarallanpoe,teeth. In another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like
edgarallanpoe,"the thunder of the firmament, and I fell impetuously to the earth."
edgarallanpoe,"Stifling in a paroxysm of terror, I at last found myself partially"
edgarallanpoe,"awake. My dream, then, was not all a dream. Now, at least, I was in"
edgarallanpoe,possession of my senses. The paws of some huge and real monster were
edgarallanpoe,pressing heavily upon my bosom--his hot breath was in my ear--and his
edgarallanpoe,white and ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.
edgarallanpoe,Had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the utterance
edgarallanpoe,"of a syllable, I could have neither stirred nor spoken. The beast,"
edgarallanpoe,"whatever it was, retained his position without attempting any immediate"
edgarallanpoe,"violence, while I lay in an utterly helpless, and, I fancied, a dying"
edgarallanpoe,condition beneath him. I felt that my powers of body and mind were fast
edgarallanpoe,"leaving me--in a word, that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer"
edgarallanpoe,fright. My brain swam--I grew deadly sick--my vision failed--even the
edgarallanpoe,"glaring eyeballs above me grew dim. Making a last strong effort, I at"
edgarallanpoe,"length breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself to"
edgarallanpoe,die. The sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the
edgarallanpoe,animal. He precipitated himself at full length upon my body; but what
edgarallanpoe,"was my astonishment, when, with a long and low whine, he commenced"
edgarallanpoe,"licking my face and hands with the greatest eagerness, and with the"
edgarallanpoe,"most extravagant demonstration of affection and joy! I was bewildered,"
edgarallanpoe,utterly lost in amazement--but I could not forget the peculiar whine
edgarallanpoe,"of my Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses I well"
edgarallanpoe,knew. It was he. I experienced a sudden rush of blood to my temples--a
edgarallanpoe,giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and reanimation. I rose
edgarallanpoe,"hurriedly from the mattress upon which I had been lying, and, throwing"
edgarallanpoe,"myself upon the neck of my faithful follower and friend, relieved the"
edgarallanpoe,long oppression of my bosom in a flood of the most passionate tears.
edgarallanpoe,As upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the greatest
edgarallanpoe,indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress. For a long time
edgarallanpoe,"I found it nearly impossible to connect any ideas; but, by very slow"
edgarallanpoe,"degrees, my thinking faculties returned, and I again called to memory"
edgarallanpoe,the several incidents of my condition. For the presence of Tiger I tried
edgarallanpoe,in vain to account; and after busying myself with a thousand different
edgarallanpoe,"conjectures respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing"
edgarallanpoe,"that he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort"
edgarallanpoe,by his caresses. Most people love their dogs--but for Tiger I had an
edgarallanpoe,"affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly, did"
edgarallanpoe,any creature more truly deserve it. For seven years he had been my
edgarallanpoe,"inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances had given"
edgarallanpoe,evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value the animal. I
edgarallanpoe,"had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of a malignant little"
edgarallanpoe,"villain in Nantucket who was leading him, with a rope around his neck,"
edgarallanpoe,"to the water; and the grown dog repaid the obligation, about three years"
edgarallanpoe,"afterward, by saving me from the bludgeon of a street robber."
edgarallanpoe,"Getting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my ear, that"
edgarallanpoe,"it had again run down; but at this I was not at all surprised, being"
edgarallanpoe,"convinced, from the peculiar state of my feelings, that I had slept,"
edgarallanpoe,"as before, for a very long period of time, how long, it was of course"
edgarallanpoe,"impossible to say. I was burning up with fever, and my thirst was almost"
edgarallanpoe,intolerable. I felt about the box for my little remaining supply of
edgarallanpoe,"water, for I had no light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the"
edgarallanpoe,"lantern, and the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. Upon finding"
edgarallanpoe,"the jug, however, I discovered it to be empty--Tiger, no doubt, having"
edgarallanpoe,"been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of mutton,"
edgarallanpoe,"the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the box. The"
edgarallanpoe,"spoiled meat I could well spare, but my heart sank as I thought of the"
edgarallanpoe,"water. I was feeble in the extreme--so much so that I shook all over,"
edgarallanpoe,"as with an ague, at the slightest movement or exertion. To add to my"
edgarallanpoe,"troubles, the brig was pitching and rolling with great violence, and"
edgarallanpoe,the oil-casks which lay upon my box were in momentary danger of falling
edgarallanpoe,"down, so as to block up the only way of ingress or egress. I felt, also,"
edgarallanpoe,terrible sufferings from sea-sickness. These considerations determined
edgarallanpoe,"me to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate"
edgarallanpoe,"relief, before I should be incapacitated from doing so altogether."
edgarallanpoe,"Having come to this resolve, I again felt about for the phosphorus-box"
edgarallanpoe,"and tapers. The former I found after some little trouble; but, not"
edgarallanpoe,discovering the tapers as soon as I had expected (for I remembered very
edgarallanpoe,"nearly the spot in which I had placed them), I gave up the search for"
edgarallanpoe,"the present, and bidding Tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey"
edgarallanpoe,toward the trap.
edgarallanpoe,In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent.
edgarallanpoe,"It was with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along at all, and"
edgarallanpoe,"very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me; when, falling"
edgarallanpoe,"prostrate on my face, I would remain for some minutes in a state"
edgarallanpoe,"bordering on insensibility. Still I struggled forward by slow degrees,"
edgarallanpoe,dreading every moment that I should swoon amid the narrow and intricate
edgarallanpoe,"windings of the lumber, in which event I had nothing but death to expect"
edgarallanpoe,"as the result. At length, upon making a push forward with all the energy"
edgarallanpoe,"I could command, I struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner"
edgarallanpoe,of an iron-bound crate. The accident only stunned me for a few moments;
edgarallanpoe,"but I found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick and violent"
edgarallanpoe,"roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely across my path, so as"
edgarallanpoe,effectually to block up the passage. With my utmost exertions I could
edgarallanpoe,"not move it a single inch from its position, it being closely wedged"
edgarallanpoe,"in among the surrounding boxes and ship-furniture. It became necessary,"
edgarallanpoe,"therefore, enfeebled as I was, either to leave the guidance of the"
edgarallanpoe,"whipcord and seek out a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and"
edgarallanpoe,resume the path on the other side. The former alternative presented too
edgarallanpoe,many difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. In my
edgarallanpoe,"present weak state of both mind and body, I should infallibly lose"
edgarallanpoe,"my way if I attempted it, and perish miserably amid the dismal and"
edgarallanpoe,"disgusting labyrinths of the hold. I proceeded, therefore, without"
edgarallanpoe,"hesitation, to summon up all my remaining strength and fortitude, and"
edgarallanpoe,"endeavour, as I best might, to clamber over the crate."
edgarallanpoe,"Upon standing erect, with this end in view, I found the undertaking even"
edgarallanpoe,a more serious task than my fears had led me to imagine. On each side of
edgarallanpoe,"the narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy lumber, which"
edgarallanpoe,the least blunder on my part might be the means of bringing down upon my
edgarallanpoe,"head; or, if this accident did not occur, the path might be effectually"
edgarallanpoe,"blocked up against my return by the descending mass, as it was in front"
edgarallanpoe,"by the obstacle there. The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box,"
edgarallanpoe,"upon which no foothold could be obtained. In vain I attempted, by every"
edgarallanpoe,"means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being thus enabled"
edgarallanpoe,"to draw myself up. Had I succeeded in reaching it, it is certain that"
edgarallanpoe,my strength would have proved utterly inadequate to the task of getting
edgarallanpoe,"over, and it was better in every respect that I failed. At length, in"
edgarallanpoe,"a desperate effort to force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong"
edgarallanpoe,vibration in the side next me. I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge
edgarallanpoe,"of the planks, and found that a very large one was loose. With my"
edgarallanpoe,"pocket-knife, which, luckily, I had with me, I succeeded, after great"
edgarallanpoe,"labour, in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture,"
edgarallanpoe,"discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the"
edgarallanpoe,"opposite side--in other words, that the top was wanting, it being the"
edgarallanpoe,bottom through which I had forced my way. I now met with no important
edgarallanpoe,difficulty in proceeding along the line until I finally reached the
edgarallanpoe,"nail. With a beating heart I stood erect, and with a gentle touch"
edgarallanpoe,pressed against the cover of the trap. It did not rise as soon as I
edgarallanpoe,"had expected, and I pressed it with somewhat more determination,"
edgarallanpoe,still dreading lest some other person than Augustus might be in his
edgarallanpoe,"state-room. The door, however, to my astonishment, remained steady, and"
edgarallanpoe,"I became somewhat uneasy, for I knew that it had formerly required"
edgarallanpoe,but little or no effort to remove it. I pushed it strongly--it was
edgarallanpoe,nevertheless firm: with all my strength--it still did not give way: with
edgarallanpoe,"rage, with fury, with despair--it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and"
edgarallanpoe,"it was evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the"
edgarallanpoe,"hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or that some"
edgarallanpoe,"immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was useless to think of"
edgarallanpoe,removing.
edgarallanpoe,My sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. In vain I
edgarallanpoe,attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus entombed. I
edgarallanpoe,"could summon up no connected chain of reflection, and, sinking on the"
edgarallanpoe,"floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most gloomy imaginings, in"
edgarallanpoe,"which the dreadful deaths of thirst, famine, suffocation, and premature"
edgarallanpoe,interment crowded upon me as the prominent disasters to be encountered.
edgarallanpoe,At length there returned to me some portion of presence of mind. I
edgarallanpoe,"arose, and felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture."
edgarallanpoe,"Having found them, I examined them closely to ascertain if they emitted"
edgarallanpoe,any light from the state-room; but none was visible. I then forced the
edgarallanpoe,"blade of my pen-knife through them, until I met with some hard obstacle."
edgarallanpoe,"Scraping against it, I discovered it to be a solid mass of iron, which,"
edgarallanpoe,"from its peculiar wavy feel as I passed the blade along it, I concluded"
edgarallanpoe,to be a chain-cable. The only course now left me was to retrace my
edgarallanpoe,"way to the box, and there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to"
edgarallanpoe,tranquilize my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape.
edgarallanpoe,"I immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after innumerable"
edgarallanpoe,"difficulties, in getting back. As I sank, utterly exhausted, upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length by my side, and seemed as"
edgarallanpoe,"if desirous, by his caresses, of consoling me in my troubles, and urging"
edgarallanpoe,me to bear them with fortitude.
edgarallanpoe,The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my
edgarallanpoe,"attention. After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he would"
edgarallanpoe,"suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. Upon reaching out my"
edgarallanpoe,"hand toward him, I then invariably found him lying on his back, with his"
edgarallanpoe,"paws uplifted. This conduct, so frequently repeated, appeared strange,"
edgarallanpoe,"and I could in no manner account for it. As the dog seemed distressed,"
edgarallanpoe,"I concluded that he had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my"
edgarallanpoe,"hands, I examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. I"
edgarallanpoe,"then supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he"
edgarallanpoe,"devoured with avidity--afterward, however, resuming his extraordinary"
edgarallanpoe,"manoeuvres. I now imagined that he was suffering, like myself, the"
edgarallanpoe,"torments of thirst, and was about adopting this conclusion as the true"
edgarallanpoe,"one, when the idea occurred to me that I had as yet only examined his"
edgarallanpoe,"paws, and that there might possibly be a wound upon some portion of his"
edgarallanpoe,"body or head. The latter I felt carefully over, but found nothing. On"
edgarallanpoe,"passing my hand, however, along his back, I perceived a slight erection"
edgarallanpoe,"of the hair extending completely across it. Probing this with my finger,"
edgarallanpoe,"I discovered a string, and tracing it up, found that it encircled the"
edgarallanpoe,"whole body. Upon a closer scrutiny, I came across a small slip of what"
edgarallanpoe,"had the feeling of letter paper, through which the string had been"
edgarallanpoe,fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately beneath the left
edgarallanpoe,shoulder of the animal.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 3
edgarallanpoe,THE thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note from
edgarallanpoe,"Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having happened to"
edgarallanpoe,"prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had devised this method of"
edgarallanpoe,"acquainting me with the true state of affairs. Trembling with eagerness,"
edgarallanpoe,I now commenced another search for my phosphorus matches and tapers.
edgarallanpoe,I had a confused recollection of having put them carefully away just
edgarallanpoe,"before falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the"
edgarallanpoe,"trap, I had been able to remember the exact spot where I had deposited"
edgarallanpoe,"them. But now I endeavored in vain to call it to mind, and busied myself"
edgarallanpoe,for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for the missing
edgarallanpoe,"articles; never, surely, was there a more tantalizing state of anxiety"
edgarallanpoe,"and suspense. At length, while groping about, with my head close to the"
edgarallanpoe,"ballast, near the opening of the box, and outside of it, I perceived"
edgarallanpoe,a faint glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. Greatly
edgarallanpoe,"surprised, I endeavored to make my way toward it, as it appeared to"
edgarallanpoe,be but a few feet from my position. Scarcely had I moved with this
edgarallanpoe,"intention, when I lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and, before I"
edgarallanpoe,"could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel along by the box"
edgarallanpoe,"until I had exactly resumed my original situation. Now, moving my head"
edgarallanpoe,"with caution to and fro, I found that, by proceeding slowly, with great"
edgarallanpoe,"care, in an opposite direction to that in which I had at first started,"
edgarallanpoe,"I was enabled to draw near the light, still keeping it in view."
edgarallanpoe,Presently I came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through
edgarallanpoe,"innumerable narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some"
edgarallanpoe,fragments of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side. I
edgarallanpoe,"was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell upon two"
edgarallanpoe,"or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently mumbled by the"
edgarallanpoe,dog. I concluded at once that he had devoured the whole of my supply
edgarallanpoe,"of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever able to read the note of"
edgarallanpoe,Augustus. The small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among other
edgarallanpoe,"rubbish in the barrel, that I despaired of deriving any service from"
edgarallanpoe,"them, and left them as they were. The phosphorus, of which there was"
edgarallanpoe,"only a speck or two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned"
edgarallanpoe,"with it, after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while"
edgarallanpoe,remained.
edgarallanpoe,What to do next I could not tell. The hold was so intensely dark that
edgarallanpoe,"I could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my face. The"
edgarallanpoe,"white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not even that when"
edgarallanpoe,I looked at it directly; by turning the exterior portions of the retina
edgarallanpoe,"toward it--that is to say, by surveying it slightly askance, I found"
edgarallanpoe,that it became in some measure perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison
edgarallanpoe,"may be imagined, and the note of my friend, if indeed it were a note"
edgarallanpoe,"from him, seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble, by"
edgarallanpoe,disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind.
edgarallanpoe,In vain I revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for
edgarallanpoe,procuring light--such expedients precisely as a man in the perturbed
edgarallanpoe,sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar
edgarallanpoe,purpose--each and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the
edgarallanpoe,"most reasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions, just as the"
edgarallanpoe,"reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker, alternately, one above the"
edgarallanpoe,"other. At last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational, and which"
edgarallanpoe,"gave me cause to wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained"
edgarallanpoe,"it before. I placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and,"
edgarallanpoe,collecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought
edgarallanpoe,"from the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. I then, with the"
edgarallanpoe,"palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. A clear"
edgarallanpoe,light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface; and had
edgarallanpoe,"there been any writing upon it, I should not have experienced the"
edgarallanpoe,"least difficulty, I am sure, in reading it. Not a syllable was there,"
edgarallanpoe,however--nothing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank; the illumination
edgarallanpoe,"died away in a few seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went."
edgarallanpoe,"I have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some period"
edgarallanpoe,"prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on idiocy. There"
edgarallanpoe,"were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect sanity, and, now and"
edgarallanpoe,"then, even of energy; but these were few. It must be remembered that"
edgarallanpoe,"I had been, for many days certainly, inhaling the almost pestilential"
edgarallanpoe,"atmosphere of a close hold in a whaling vessel, and for a long portion"
edgarallanpoe,of that time but scantily supplied with water. For the last fourteen
edgarallanpoe,or fifteen hours I had none--nor had I slept during that time. Salt
edgarallanpoe,"provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed,"
edgarallanpoe,"since the loss of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception"
edgarallanpoe,"of the sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as"
edgarallanpoe,they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched
edgarallanpoe,"condition of my throat. I was now in a high state of fever, and in"
edgarallanpoe,every respect exceedingly ill. This will account for the fact that many
edgarallanpoe,miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure with the
edgarallanpoe,"phosphorus, before the thought suggested itself that I had examined only"
edgarallanpoe,one side of the paper. I shall not attempt to describe my feelings
edgarallanpoe,of rage (for I believe I was more angry than any thing else) when the
edgarallanpoe,egregious oversight I had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception.
edgarallanpoe,"The blunder itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and"
edgarallanpoe,impetuosity rendered it otherwise--in my disappointment at not finding
edgarallanpoe,"some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in pieces and thrown"
edgarallanpoe,"it away, it was impossible to say where."
edgarallanpoe,From the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the sagacity of
edgarallanpoe,"Tiger. Having got, after a long search, a small piece of the note, I put"
edgarallanpoe,"it to the dog’s nose, and endeavored to make him understand that he must"
edgarallanpoe,"bring me the rest of it. To my astonishment, (for I had taught him none"
edgarallanpoe,"of the usual tricks for which his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter"
edgarallanpoe,"at once into my meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon"
edgarallanpoe,"found another considerable portion. Bringing me this, he paused awhile,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for"
edgarallanpoe,"my approval of what he had done. I patted him on the head, when he"
edgarallanpoe,immediately made off again. It was now some minutes before he came
edgarallanpoe,"back--but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip, which"
edgarallanpoe,"proved to be all the paper missing--it having been torn, it seems,"
edgarallanpoe,"only into three pieces. Luckily, I had no trouble in finding what few"
edgarallanpoe,fragments of the phosphorus were left--being guided by the indistinct
edgarallanpoe,glow one or two of the particles still emitted. My difficulties had
edgarallanpoe,"taught me the necessity of caution, and I now took time to reflect upon"
edgarallanpoe,"what I was about to do. It was very probable, I considered, that some"
edgarallanpoe,words were written upon that side of the paper which had not been
edgarallanpoe,examined--but which side was that? Fitting the pieces together gave me
edgarallanpoe,"no clew in this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there"
edgarallanpoe,"were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a proper"
edgarallanpoe,"manner, as written. There was the greater necessity of ascertaining the"
edgarallanpoe,"point in question beyond a doubt, as the phosphorus remaining would be"
edgarallanpoe,"altogether insufficient for a third attempt, should I fail in the one I"
edgarallanpoe,"was now about to make. I placed the paper on a book as before, and sat"
edgarallanpoe,for some minutes thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. At
edgarallanpoe,last I thought it barely possible that the written side might have
edgarallanpoe,"some unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling might"
edgarallanpoe,enable me to detect. I determined to make the experiment and passed
edgarallanpoe,my finger very carefully over the side which first presented itself.
edgarallanpoe,"Nothing, however, was perceptible, and I turned the paper, adjusting it"
edgarallanpoe,"on the book. I now again carried my forefinger cautiously along, when"
edgarallanpoe,"I was aware of an exceedingly slight, but still discernable glow, which"
edgarallanpoe,"followed as it proceeded. This, I knew, must arise from some very minute"
edgarallanpoe,remaining particles of the phosphorus with which I had covered the paper
edgarallanpoe,"in my previous attempt. The other, or under side, then, was that on"
edgarallanpoe,"which lay the writing, if writing there should finally prove to be."
edgarallanpoe,"Again I turned the note, and went to work as I had previously done."
edgarallanpoe,"Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a brilliancy ensued as before--but this"
edgarallanpoe,"time several lines of MS. in a large hand, and apparently in red ink,"
edgarallanpoe,"became distinctly visible. The glimmer, although sufficiently bright,"
edgarallanpoe,"was but momentary. Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there"
edgarallanpoe,would have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three
edgarallanpoe,"sentences before me--for I saw there were three. In my anxiety, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"to read all at once, I succeeded only in reading the seven concluding"
edgarallanpoe,"words, which thus appeared--“blood--your life depends upon lying close.”"
edgarallanpoe,Had I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note--the full
edgarallanpoe,"meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey,"
edgarallanpoe,"that admonition, even although it should have revealed a story of"
edgarallanpoe,"disaster the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly convinced, have"
edgarallanpoe,imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing and yet indefinable
edgarallanpoe,horror with which I was inspired by the fragmentary warning thus
edgarallanpoe,"received. And “blood,” too, that word of all words--so rife at all times"
edgarallanpoe,"with mystery, and suffering, and terror--how trebly full of import did"
edgarallanpoe,"it now appear--how chilly and heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from"
edgarallanpoe,any foregoing words to qualify or render it distinct) did its vague
edgarallanpoe,"syllables fall, amid the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost"
edgarallanpoe,recesses of my soul!
edgarallanpoe,"Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain"
edgarallanpoe,"concealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could"
edgarallanpoe,be--but I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution of
edgarallanpoe,"the mystery. Just after returning from my last journey to the trap, and"
edgarallanpoe,before my attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct
edgarallanpoe,"of Tiger, I had come to the resolution of making myself heard at all"
edgarallanpoe,"events by those on board, or, if I could not succeed in this directly,"
edgarallanpoe,of trying to cut my way through the orlop deck. The half certainty which
edgarallanpoe,I felt of being able to accomplish one of these two purposes in the last
edgarallanpoe,"emergency, had given me courage (which I should not otherwise have had)"
edgarallanpoe,to endure the evils of my situation. The few words I had been able to
edgarallanpoe,"read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and I now, for"
edgarallanpoe,"the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. In a paroxysm of despair"
edgarallanpoe,"I threw myself again upon the mattress, where, for about the period of"
edgarallanpoe,"a day and night, I lay in a kind of stupor, relieved only by momentary"
edgarallanpoe,intervals of reason and recollection.
edgarallanpoe,"At length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon the"
edgarallanpoe,horrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours it was
edgarallanpoe,barely possible that I might exist without water--for a longer time I
edgarallanpoe,could not do so. During the first portion of my imprisonment I had made
edgarallanpoe,"free use of the cordials with which Augustus had supplied me, but they"
edgarallanpoe,"only served to excite fever, without in the least degree assuaging"
edgarallanpoe,"thirst. I had now only about a gill left, and this was of a species of"
edgarallanpoe,strong peach liqueur at which my stomach revolted. The sausages were
edgarallanpoe,entirely consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the
edgarallanpoe,"skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had been eaten"
edgarallanpoe,"by Tiger. To add to my troubles, I found that my headache was increasing"
edgarallanpoe,"momentarily, and with it the species of delirium which had distressed me"
edgarallanpoe,more or less since my first falling asleep. For some hours past it had
edgarallanpoe,"been with the greatest difficulty I could breathe at all, and now each"
edgarallanpoe,attempt at so doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic
edgarallanpoe,action of the chest. But there was still another and very different
edgarallanpoe,"source of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had"
edgarallanpoe,been the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the
edgarallanpoe,mattress. It arose from the demeanor of the dog.
edgarallanpoe,I first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in the
edgarallanpoe,"phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he ran his nose"
edgarallanpoe,against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too greatly excited at
edgarallanpoe,"the time to pay much attention to the circumstance. Soon afterward,"
edgarallanpoe,"it will be remembered, I threw myself on the mattress, and fell into"
edgarallanpoe,a species of lethargy. Presently I became aware of a singular hissing
edgarallanpoe,"sound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was"
edgarallanpoe,"panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his"
edgarallanpoe,"eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him, when he"
edgarallanpoe,"replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet. Presently I relapsed"
edgarallanpoe,"into my stupor, from which I was again awakened in a similar manner."
edgarallanpoe,"This was repeated three or four times, until finally his behaviour"
edgarallanpoe,"inspired me with so great a degree of fear, that I became fully aroused."
edgarallanpoe,"He was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully,"
edgarallanpoe,"although in a kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly"
edgarallanpoe,convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the
edgarallanpoe,"confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at a loss"
edgarallanpoe,"what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of killing him,"
edgarallanpoe,yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety. I could distinctly
edgarallanpoe,perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly
edgarallanpoe,"animosity, and I expected every instant that he would attack me. At last"
edgarallanpoe,"I could endure my terrible situation no longer, and determined to make"
edgarallanpoe,"my way from the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition"
edgarallanpoe,"should render it necessary for me to do so. To get out, I had to"
edgarallanpoe,"pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate my"
edgarallanpoe,design--missing himself upon his fore-legs (as I perceived by the
edgarallanpoe,"altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his white"
edgarallanpoe,"fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the remains of the"
edgarallanpoe,"ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured them about"
edgarallanpoe,"my person, together with a large carving-knife which Augustus had left"
edgarallanpoe,"me--then, folding my cloak around me as closely as possible, I made a"
edgarallanpoe,"movement toward the mouth of the box. No sooner did I do this, than the"
edgarallanpoe,dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat. The whole weight of his
edgarallanpoe,"body struck me on the right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left,"
edgarallanpoe,while the enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had fallen upon my
edgarallanpoe,"knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these protected"
edgarallanpoe,"me from a second furious assault, during which I felt the sharp teeth"
edgarallanpoe,"pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck--yet,"
edgarallanpoe,"luckily, without being able to penetrate all the folds. I was now"
edgarallanpoe,"beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his"
edgarallanpoe,"power. Despair gave me strength, and I rose boldly up, shaking him from"
edgarallanpoe,"me by main force, and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress."
edgarallanpoe,"These I now threw over him, and before he could extricate himself, I had"
edgarallanpoe,got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit.
edgarallanpoe,"In this struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of"
edgarallanpoe,"ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a"
edgarallanpoe,"single gill of liqueur. As this reflection crossed my mind, I felt"
edgarallanpoe,myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be
edgarallanpoe,"supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it to the last drop, and dashed"
edgarallanpoe,it furiously upon the floor.
edgarallanpoe,"Scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my name"
edgarallanpoe,"pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the direction of"
edgarallanpoe,"the steerage. So unexpected was anything of the kind, and so intense was"
edgarallanpoe,"the emotion excited within me by the sound, that I endeavoured in vain"
edgarallanpoe,"to reply. My powers of speech totally failed, and in an agony of terror"
edgarallanpoe,"lest my friend should conclude me dead, and return without attempting"
edgarallanpoe,"to reach me, I stood up between the crates near the door of the box,"
edgarallanpoe,"trembling convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. Had"
edgarallanpoe,"a thousand words depended upon a syllable, I could not have spoken"
edgarallanpoe,it. There was a slight movement now audible among the lumber somewhere
edgarallanpoe,"forward of my station. The sound presently grew less distinct, then"
edgarallanpoe,"again less so, and still less. Shall I ever forget my feelings at this"
edgarallanpoe,"moment? He was going--my friend, my companion, from whom I had a right"
edgarallanpoe,to expect so much--he was going--he would abandon me--he was gone! He
edgarallanpoe,"would leave me to perish miserably, to expire in the most horrible and"
edgarallanpoe,"loathesome of dungeons--and one word, one little syllable, would save"
edgarallanpoe,"me--yet that single syllable I could not utter! I felt, I am sure, more"
edgarallanpoe,"than ten thousand times the agonies of death itself. My brain reeled,"
edgarallanpoe,"and I fell, deadly sick, against the end of the box."
edgarallanpoe,As I fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of my
edgarallanpoe,"pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor. Never did"
edgarallanpoe,any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my ears! With the
edgarallanpoe,intensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the effect of the noise upon
edgarallanpoe,Augustus--for I knew that the person who called my name could be no one
edgarallanpoe,but himself. All was silent for some moments. At length I again heard
edgarallanpoe,"the word “Arthur!” repeated in a low tone, and one full of hesitation."
edgarallanpoe,"Reviving hope loosened at once my powers of speech, and I now screamed"
edgarallanpoe,"at the top of my voice, “Augustus! oh, Augustus!” “Hush! for God’s sake"
edgarallanpoe,"be silent!” he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; “I will be"
edgarallanpoe,with you immediately--as soon as I can make my way through the hold.”
edgarallanpoe,"For a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and every moment"
edgarallanpoe,"seemed to me an age. At length I felt his hand upon my shoulder, and he"
edgarallanpoe,"placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water to my lips. Those only who"
edgarallanpoe,"have been suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb, or who have known"
edgarallanpoe,the insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as aggravated as
edgarallanpoe,"those which encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the"
edgarallanpoe,unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest of all
edgarallanpoe,physical luxuries afforded.
edgarallanpoe,"When I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced from"
edgarallanpoe,"his pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which I devoured with the"
edgarallanpoe,"greatest avidity. He had brought with him a light in a dark lantern, and"
edgarallanpoe,the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than the food and
edgarallanpoe,"drink. But I was impatient to learn the cause of his protracted absence,"
edgarallanpoe,and he proceeded to recount what had happened on board during my
edgarallanpoe,incarceration.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 4
edgarallanpoe,"THE brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he had"
edgarallanpoe,left the watch. This was on the twentieth of June. It will be remembered
edgarallanpoe,"that I had then been in the hold for three days; and, during this"
edgarallanpoe,"period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and so much running"
edgarallanpoe,"to and fro, especially in the cabin and staterooms, that he had had no"
edgarallanpoe,chance of visiting me without the risk of having the secret of the trap
edgarallanpoe,"discovered. When at length he did come, I had assured him that I was"
edgarallanpoe,"doing as well as possible; and, therefore, for the two next days he"
edgarallanpoe,"felt but little uneasiness on my account--still, however, watching an"
edgarallanpoe,opportunity of going down. It was not until the fourth day that he found
edgarallanpoe,one. Several times during this interval he had made up his mind to let
edgarallanpoe,"his father know of the adventure, and have me come up at once; but we"
edgarallanpoe,"were still within reaching distance of Nantucket, and it was doubtful,"
edgarallanpoe,"from some expressions which had escaped Captain Barnard, whether he"
edgarallanpoe,would not immediately put back if he discovered me to be on board.
edgarallanpoe,"Besides, upon thinking the matter over, Augustus, so he told me, could"
edgarallanpoe,"not imagine that I was in immediate want, or that I would hesitate,"
edgarallanpoe,"in such case, to make myself heard at the trap. When, therefore, he"
edgarallanpoe,considered everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet
edgarallanpoe,"with an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. This, as I said before,"
edgarallanpoe,"did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the watch,"
edgarallanpoe,and the seventh since I had first entered the hold. He then went down
edgarallanpoe,"without taking with him any water or provisions, intending in the first"
edgarallanpoe,"place merely to call my attention, and get me to come from the box to"
edgarallanpoe,"the trap,--when he would go up to the stateroom and thence hand me down"
edgarallanpoe,"a supply. When he descended for this purpose he found that I was asleep,"
edgarallanpoe,for it seems that I was snoring very loudly. From all the calculations
edgarallanpoe,"I can make on the subject, this must have been the slumber into which"
edgarallanpoe,"I fell just after my return from the trap with the watch, and which,"
edgarallanpoe,"consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days and"
edgarallanpoe,"nights at the very least. Latterly, I have had reason both from my own"
edgarallanpoe,"experience and the assurance of others, to be acquainted with the strong"
edgarallanpoe,soporific effects of the stench arising from old fish-oil when closely
edgarallanpoe,confined; and when I think of the condition of the hold in which I was
edgarallanpoe,"imprisoned, and the long period during which the brig had been used as a"
edgarallanpoe,"whaling vessel, I am more inclined to wonder that I awoke at all, after"
edgarallanpoe,"once falling asleep, than that I should have slept uninterruptedly for"
edgarallanpoe,the period specified above.
edgarallanpoe,Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the
edgarallanpoe,"trap--but I made him no reply. He then shut the trap, and spoke to me in"
edgarallanpoe,"a louder, and finally in a very loud tone--still I continued to snore."
edgarallanpoe,He was now at a loss what to do. It would take him some time to make his
edgarallanpoe,"way through the lumber to my box, and in the meanwhile his absence would"
edgarallanpoe,"be noticed by Captain Barnard, who had occasion for his services every"
edgarallanpoe,"minute, in arranging and copying papers connected with the business of"
edgarallanpoe,"the voyage. He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and"
edgarallanpoe,await another opportunity of visiting me. He was the more easily induced
edgarallanpoe,"to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most tranquil"
edgarallanpoe,"nature, and he could not suppose that I had undergone any inconvenience"
edgarallanpoe,from my incarceration. He had just made up his mind on these points
edgarallanpoe,"when his attention was arrested by an unusual bustle, the sound of"
edgarallanpoe,which proceeded apparently from the cabin. He sprang through the trap
edgarallanpoe,"as quickly as possible, closed it, and threw open the door of his"
edgarallanpoe,stateroom. No sooner had he put his foot over the threshold than a
edgarallanpoe,"pistol flashed in his face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment,"
edgarallanpoe,by a blow from a handspike.
edgarallanpoe,"A strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp upon"
edgarallanpoe,his throat; still he was able to see what was going on around him.
edgarallanpoe,"His father was tied hand and foot, and lying along the steps of the"
edgarallanpoe,"companion-way, with his head down, and a deep wound in the forehead,"
edgarallanpoe,from which the blood was flowing in a continued stream. He spoke not a
edgarallanpoe,"word, and was apparently dying. Over him stood the first mate, eyeing"
edgarallanpoe,"him with an expression of fiendish derision, and deliberately searching"
edgarallanpoe,"his pockets, from which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a"
edgarallanpoe,"chronometer. Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were"
edgarallanpoe,"rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they soon"
edgarallanpoe,equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. Besides Augustus and
edgarallanpoe,"Captain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in the cabin, and these"
edgarallanpoe,among the most ruffianly of the brig’s company. The villains now went
edgarallanpoe,"upon deck, taking my friend with them after having secured his arms"
edgarallanpoe,"behind his back. They proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was"
edgarallanpoe,fastened down--two of the mutineers standing by it with axes--two also
edgarallanpoe,at the main hatch. The mate called out in a loud voice: “Do you hear
edgarallanpoe,"there below? tumble up with you, one by one--now, mark that--and no"
edgarallanpoe,grumbling!” It was some minutes before any one appeared:--at last an
edgarallanpoe,"Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping piteously,"
edgarallanpoe,"and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to spare his life."
edgarallanpoe,The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe. The poor fellow
edgarallanpoe,"fell to the deck without a groan, and the black cook lifted him up in"
edgarallanpoe,"his arms as he would a child, and tossed him deliberately into the sea."
edgarallanpoe,"Hearing the blow and the plunge of the body, the men below could now"
edgarallanpoe,"be induced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a"
edgarallanpoe,"proposition was made to smoke them out. A general rush then ensued,"
edgarallanpoe,and for a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken.
edgarallanpoe,"The mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle"
edgarallanpoe,effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up.
edgarallanpoe,"These six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without arms,"
edgarallanpoe,submitted after a brief struggle. The mate gave them fair words--no
edgarallanpoe,"doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for they had no"
edgarallanpoe,difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. The result proved his
edgarallanpoe,"sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy. All in the forecastle"
edgarallanpoe,"presently signified their intention of submitting, and, ascending one"
edgarallanpoe,"by one, were pinioned and then thrown on their backs, together with the"
edgarallanpoe,"first six--there being in all, of the crew who were not concerned in the"
edgarallanpoe,"mutiny, twenty-seven."
edgarallanpoe,A scene of the most horrible butchery ensued. The bound seamen were
edgarallanpoe,"dragged to the gangway. Here the cook stood with an axe, striking each"
edgarallanpoe,victim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the
edgarallanpoe,"other mutineers. In this manner twenty-two perished, and Augustus had"
edgarallanpoe,"given himself up for lost, expecting every moment his own turn to come"
edgarallanpoe,"next. But it seemed that the villains were now either weary, or in"
edgarallanpoe,some measure disgusted with their bloody labour; for the four remaining
edgarallanpoe,"prisoners, together with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with"
edgarallanpoe,"the rest, were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole"
edgarallanpoe,"murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until sunset. They"
edgarallanpoe,"now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the survivors, who lay"
edgarallanpoe,"not more than four paces off, and could distinguish every word said."
edgarallanpoe,Upon some of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have a softening
edgarallanpoe,"effect, for several voices were heard in favor of releasing the captives"
edgarallanpoe,"altogether, on condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits."
edgarallanpoe,"The black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon,"
edgarallanpoe,"and who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the"
edgarallanpoe,"mate himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose"
edgarallanpoe,repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway.
edgarallanpoe,Fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be easily
edgarallanpoe,"restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among whom was a"
edgarallanpoe,"line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters. This man was the"
edgarallanpoe,"son of an Indian squaw of the tribe of Upsarokas, who live among the"
edgarallanpoe,"fastnesses of the Black Hills, near the source of the Missouri. His"
edgarallanpoe,"father was a fur-trader, I believe, or at least connected in some manner"
edgarallanpoe,with the Indian trading-posts on Lewis river. Peters himself was one of
edgarallanpoe,"the most ferocious-looking men I ever beheld. He was short in stature,"
edgarallanpoe,"not more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of"
edgarallanpoe,"Herculean mould. His hands, especially, were so enormously thick and"
edgarallanpoe,"broad as hardly to retain a human shape. His arms, as well as legs,"
edgarallanpoe,"were bowed in the most singular manner, and appeared to possess no"
edgarallanpoe,"flexibility whatever. His head was equally deformed, being of immense"
edgarallanpoe,"size, with an indentation on the crown (like that on the head of most"
edgarallanpoe,"negroes), and entirely bald. To conceal this latter deficiency, which"
edgarallanpoe,"did not proceed from old age, he usually wore a wig formed of any"
edgarallanpoe,hair-like material which presented itself--occasionally the skin of a
edgarallanpoe,"Spanish dog or American grizzly bear. At the time spoken of, he had on a"
edgarallanpoe,portion of one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural
edgarallanpoe,"ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the Upsaroka character. The"
edgarallanpoe,"mouth extended nearly from ear to ear, the lips were thin, and seemed,"
edgarallanpoe,"like some other portions of his frame, to be devoid of natural pliancy,"
edgarallanpoe,so that the ruling expression never varied under the influence of any
edgarallanpoe,emotion whatever. This ruling expression may be conceived when it is
edgarallanpoe,"considered that the teeth were exceedingly long and protruding, and"
edgarallanpoe,"never even partially covered, in any instance, by the lips. To pass this"
edgarallanpoe,"man with a casual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with"
edgarallanpoe,"laughter, but a second look would induce a shuddering acknowledgment,"
edgarallanpoe,"that if such an expression were indicative of merriment, the merriment"
edgarallanpoe,must be that of a demon. Of this singular being many anecdotes were
edgarallanpoe,prevalent among the seafaring men of Nantucket. These anecdotes went to
edgarallanpoe,"prove his prodigious strength when under excitement, and some of them"
edgarallanpoe,"had given rise to a doubt of his sanity. But on board the Grampus, it"
edgarallanpoe,"seems, he was regarded, at the time of the mutiny, with feelings more of"
edgarallanpoe,derision than of anything else. I have been thus particular in speaking
edgarallanpoe,"of Dirk Peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he proved the main"
edgarallanpoe,"instrument in preserving the life of Augustus, and because I shall"
edgarallanpoe,have frequent occasion to mention him hereafter in the course of my
edgarallanpoe,"narrative--a narrative, let me here say, which, in its latter portions,"
edgarallanpoe,will be found to include incidents of a nature so entirely out of the
edgarallanpoe,"range of human experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits"
edgarallanpoe,"of human credulity, that I proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining"
edgarallanpoe,"credence for all that I shall tell, yet confidently trusting in time"
edgarallanpoe,and progressing science to verify some of the most important and most
edgarallanpoe,improbable of my statements.
edgarallanpoe,"After much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was"
edgarallanpoe,determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of
edgarallanpoe,"Augustus, whom Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping as his"
edgarallanpoe,clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest whaleboats. The
edgarallanpoe,mate went down into the cabin to see if Captain Barnard was still
edgarallanpoe,"living--for, it will be remembered, he was left below when the mutineers"
edgarallanpoe,"came up. Presently the two made their appearance, the captain pale as"
edgarallanpoe,"death, but somewhat recovered from the effects of his wound. He spoke"
edgarallanpoe,"to the men in a voice hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him"
edgarallanpoe,"adrift, but to return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever"
edgarallanpoe,"they chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice. He might"
edgarallanpoe,as well have spoken to the winds. Two of the ruffians seized him by the
edgarallanpoe,"arms and hurled him over the brig’s side into the boat, which had been"
edgarallanpoe,lowered while the mate went below. The four men who were lying on the
edgarallanpoe,"deck were then untied and ordered to follow, which they did without"
edgarallanpoe,attempting any resistance--Augustus being still left in his painful
edgarallanpoe,"position, although he struggled and prayed only for the poor"
edgarallanpoe,satisfaction of being permitted to bid his father farewell. A handful of
edgarallanpoe,"sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither mast,"
edgarallanpoe,"sail, oar, nor compass. The boat was towed astern for a few minutes,"
edgarallanpoe,during which the mutineers held another consultation--it was then
edgarallanpoe,finally cut adrift. By this time night had come on--there were neither
edgarallanpoe,"moon nor stars visible--and a short and ugly sea was running, although"
edgarallanpoe,"there was no great deal of wind. The boat was instantly out of sight,"
edgarallanpoe,and little hope could be entertained for the unfortunate sufferers who
edgarallanpoe,"were in it. This event happened, however, in latitude 35 degrees 30’"
edgarallanpoe,"north, longitude 61 degrees 20’ west, and consequently at no very great"
edgarallanpoe,distance from the Bermuda Islands. Augustus therefore endeavored to
edgarallanpoe,console himself with the idea that the boat might either succeed in
edgarallanpoe,"reaching the land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by"
edgarallanpoe,vessels off the coast.
edgarallanpoe,"All sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her original"
edgarallanpoe,course to the southwest--the mutineers being bent upon some piratical
edgarallanpoe,"expedition, in which, from all that could be understood, a ship was to"
edgarallanpoe,be intercepted on her way from the Cape Verd Islands to Porto Rico. No
edgarallanpoe,"attention was paid to Augustus, who was untied and suffered to go about"
edgarallanpoe,anywhere forward of the cabin companion-way. Dirk Peters treated him
edgarallanpoe,"with some degree of kindness, and on one occasion saved him from"
edgarallanpoe,the brutality of the cook. His situation was still one of the most
edgarallanpoe,"precarious, as the men were continually intoxicated, and there was no"
edgarallanpoe,relying upon their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to
edgarallanpoe,"himself. His anxiety on my account he represented, however, as the most"
edgarallanpoe,"distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, I had never reason to"
edgarallanpoe,doubt the sincerity of his friendship. More than once he had resolved
edgarallanpoe,"to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board, but was"
edgarallanpoe,"restrained from so doing, partly through recollection of the atrocities"
edgarallanpoe,"he had already beheld, and partly through a hope of being able soon to"
edgarallanpoe,bring me relief. For the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch;
edgarallanpoe,"but, in spite of the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after"
edgarallanpoe,"the boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred. At length, on the"
edgarallanpoe,"night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the eastward,"
edgarallanpoe,and all hands were called up to take in sail. During the confusion which
edgarallanpoe,"ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and into the stateroom."
edgarallanpoe,What was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had
edgarallanpoe,been rendered a place of deposit for a variety of sea-stores and
edgarallanpoe,"ship-furniture, and that several fathoms of old chain-cable, which had"
edgarallanpoe,"been stowed away beneath the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence"
edgarallanpoe,"to make room for a chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap!"
edgarallanpoe,"To remove it without discovery was impossible, and he returned on"
edgarallanpoe,"deck as quickly as he could. As he came up, the mate seized him by the"
edgarallanpoe,"throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was about"
edgarallanpoe,"flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was again"
edgarallanpoe,preserved through the interference of Dirk Peters. Augustus was now put
edgarallanpoe,"in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on board), and his feet"
edgarallanpoe,"lashed tightly together. He was then taken into the steerage, and thrown"
edgarallanpoe,"into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance"
edgarallanpoe,that he should never put his foot on deck again “until the brig was no
edgarallanpoe,"longer a brig.” This was the expression of the cook, who threw him into"
edgarallanpoe,the berth--it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended by
edgarallanpoe,"the phrase. The whole affair, however, proved the ultimate means of my"
edgarallanpoe,"relief, as will presently appear."
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 5
edgarallanpoe,"FOR some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, Augustus"
edgarallanpoe,"abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth alive."
edgarallanpoe,He now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of the men who
edgarallanpoe,"should come down with my situation, thinking it better to let me take my"
edgarallanpoe,"chance with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold,--for it had"
edgarallanpoe,"been ten days since I was first imprisoned, and my jug of water was not"
edgarallanpoe,"a plentiful supply even for four. As he was thinking on this subject,"
edgarallanpoe,the idea came all at once into his head that it might be possible
edgarallanpoe,to communicate with me by the way of the main hold. In any other
edgarallanpoe,"circumstances, the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have"
edgarallanpoe,"prevented him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little"
edgarallanpoe,"prospect of life, and consequently little to lose, he bent his whole"
edgarallanpoe,"mind, therefore, upon the task."
edgarallanpoe,His handcuffs were the first consideration. At first he saw no method
edgarallanpoe,"of removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very"
edgarallanpoe,outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the irons could
edgarallanpoe,"be slipped off and on at pleasure, with very little effort or"
edgarallanpoe,"inconvenience, merely by squeezing his hands through them,--this species"
edgarallanpoe,"of manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons,"
edgarallanpoe,in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure. He now untied his
edgarallanpoe,"feet, and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily"
edgarallanpoe,"be readjusted in the event of any person’s coming down, proceeded to"
edgarallanpoe,examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. The partition here was
edgarallanpoe,"of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he should have"
edgarallanpoe,little trouble in cutting his way through. A voice was now heard at the
edgarallanpoe,"forecastle companion-way, and he had just time to put his right hand"
edgarallanpoe,into its handcuff (the left had not been removed) and to draw the rope
edgarallanpoe,"in a slipknot around his ankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed by"
edgarallanpoe,"Tiger, who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. The dog had"
edgarallanpoe,"been brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the animal,"
edgarallanpoe,and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the
edgarallanpoe,voyage. He went up to our house for him immediately after first taking
edgarallanpoe,"me into the hold, but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon"
edgarallanpoe,"his bringing the watch. Since the mutiny, Augustus had not seen him"
edgarallanpoe,"before his appearance with Dirk Peters, and had given him up for lost,"
edgarallanpoe,supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant
edgarallanpoe,villains belonging to the mate’s gang. It appeared afterward that he had
edgarallanpoe,"crawled into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to"
edgarallanpoe,"turn round, he could not extricate himself. Peters at last let him out,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to"
edgarallanpoe,"appreciate, had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion,"
edgarallanpoe,"leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes, with a can of"
edgarallanpoe,"water, he then went on deck, promising to come down with something more"
edgarallanpoe,to eat on the next day.
edgarallanpoe,"When he had gone, Augustus freed both hands from the manacles and"
edgarallanpoe,unfastened his feet. He then turned down the head of the mattress on
edgarallanpoe,"which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the ruffians had"
edgarallanpoe,not thought it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously
edgarallanpoe,"across one of the partition planks, as closely as possible to the floor"
edgarallanpoe,"of the berth. He chose to cut here, because, if suddenly interrupted, he"
edgarallanpoe,would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head of the
edgarallanpoe,"mattress fall into its proper position. For the remainder of the day,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, no disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided"
edgarallanpoe,the plank. It should here be observed that none of the crew occupied the
edgarallanpoe,"forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the cabin since"
edgarallanpoe,"the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the sea-stores of Captain"
edgarallanpoe,"Barnard, and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the"
edgarallanpoe,navigation of the brig. These circumstances proved fortunate both for
edgarallanpoe,"myself and Augustus; for, had matters been otherwise, he would have"
edgarallanpoe,"found it impossible to reach me. As it was, he proceeded with confidence"
edgarallanpoe,"in his design. It was near daybreak, however, before he completed the"
edgarallanpoe,second division of the board (which was about a foot above the first
edgarallanpoe,"cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage"
edgarallanpoe,"through with facility to the main orlop deck. Having got here, he made"
edgarallanpoe,"his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch, although in so"
edgarallanpoe,doing he had to scramble over tiers of oil-casks piled nearly as high as
edgarallanpoe,"the upper deck, there being barely room enough left for his body. Upon"
edgarallanpoe,"reaching the hatch he found that Tiger had followed him below, squeezing"
edgarallanpoe,"between two rows of the casks. It was now too late, however, to attempt"
edgarallanpoe,"getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing"
edgarallanpoe,through the close stowage in the lower hold. He therefore resolved to
edgarallanpoe,"return, and wait till the next night. With this design, he proceeded to"
edgarallanpoe,"loosen the hatch, so that he might have as little detention as possible"
edgarallanpoe,when he should come again. No sooner had he loosened it than Tiger
edgarallanpoe,"sprang eagerly to the small opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and"
edgarallanpoe,"then uttered a long whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious"
edgarallanpoe,"to remove the covering with his paws. There could be no doubt, from"
edgarallanpoe,"his behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and Augustus"
edgarallanpoe,thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him
edgarallanpoe,"down. He now hit upon the expedient of sending the note, as it was"
edgarallanpoe,especially desirable that I should make no attempt at forcing my way out
edgarallanpoe,"at least under existing circumstances, and there could be no certainty"
edgarallanpoe,of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended. After-events
edgarallanpoe,proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did;
edgarallanpoe,"for, had it not been for the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly"
edgarallanpoe,"have fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and"
edgarallanpoe,both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence.
edgarallanpoe,"Having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the"
edgarallanpoe,materials for so doing. An old toothpick was soon made into a pen; and
edgarallanpoe,"this by means of feeling altogether, for the between-decks was as"
edgarallanpoe,dark as pitch. Paper enough was obtained from the back of a letter--a
edgarallanpoe,duplicate of the forged letter from Mr. Ross. This had been the original
edgarallanpoe,"draught; but the handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated,"
edgarallanpoe,"Augustus had written another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into"
edgarallanpoe,"his coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered. Ink alone"
edgarallanpoe,"was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found for this by"
edgarallanpoe,means of a slight incision with the pen-knife on the back of a finger
edgarallanpoe,"just above the nail--a copious flow of blood ensuing, as usual, from"
edgarallanpoe,"wounds in that vicinity. The note was now written, as well as it could"
edgarallanpoe,be in the dark and under the circumstances. It briefly explained that a
edgarallanpoe,mutiny had taken place; that Captain Barnard was set adrift; and that I
edgarallanpoe,"might expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but"
edgarallanpoe,must not venture upon making any disturbance. It concluded with these
edgarallanpoe,words: “_I have scrawled this with blood--your life depends upon lying
edgarallanpoe,close._”
edgarallanpoe,"This slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down the"
edgarallanpoe,"hatchway, and Augustus made the best of his way back to the forecastle,"
edgarallanpoe,where he found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in
edgarallanpoe,"his absence. To conceal the hole in the partition, he drove his knife in"
edgarallanpoe,"just above it, and hung up a pea-jacket which he found in the berth. His"
edgarallanpoe,"handcuffs were then replaced, and also the rope around his ankles."
edgarallanpoe,"These arrangements were scarcely completed when Dirk Peters came below,"
edgarallanpoe,"very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him my friend’s"
edgarallanpoe,allowance of provision for the day. This consisted of a dozen large
edgarallanpoe,"Irish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. He sat for some time on"
edgarallanpoe,"a chest by the berth, and talked freely about the mate and the general"
edgarallanpoe,"concerns of the brig. His demeanour was exceedingly capricious, and"
edgarallanpoe,even grotesque. At one time Augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct.
edgarallanpoe,"At last, however, he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his"
edgarallanpoe,prisoner a good dinner on the morrow. During the day two of the crew
edgarallanpoe,"(harpooners) came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the"
edgarallanpoe,"last stage of intoxication. Like Peters, they made no scruple of talking"
edgarallanpoe,unreservedly about their plans. It appeared that they were much divided
edgarallanpoe,"among themselves as to their ultimate course, agreeing in no point,"
edgarallanpoe,"except the attack on the ship from the Cape Verd Islands, with"
edgarallanpoe,which they were in hourly expectation of meeting. As far as could be
edgarallanpoe,"ascertained, the mutiny had not been brought about altogether for the"
edgarallanpoe,sake of booty; a private pique of the chief mate’s against Captain
edgarallanpoe,Barnard having been the main instigation. There now seemed to be two
edgarallanpoe,"principal factions among the crew--one headed by the mate, the other by"
edgarallanpoe,the cook. The former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel
edgarallanpoe,"which should present itself, and equipping it at some of the West India"
edgarallanpoe,"Islands for a piratical cruise. The latter division, however, which was"
edgarallanpoe,"the stronger, and included Dirk Peters among its partisans, were bent"
edgarallanpoe,upon pursuing the course originally laid out for the brig into the South
edgarallanpoe,"Pacific; there either to take whale, or act otherwise, as circumstances"
edgarallanpoe,"should suggest. The representations of Peters, who had frequently"
edgarallanpoe,"visited these regions, had great weight, apparently, with the mutineers,"
edgarallanpoe,"wavering, as they were, between half-engendered notions of profit and"
edgarallanpoe,pleasure. He dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to be found
edgarallanpoe,"among the innumerable islands of the Pacific, on the perfect security"
edgarallanpoe,"and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed, but, more particularly, on"
edgarallanpoe,"the deliciousness of the climate, on the abundant means of good living,"
edgarallanpoe,"and on the voluptuous beauty of the women. As yet, nothing had been"
edgarallanpoe,absolutely determined upon; but the pictures of the hybrid line-manager
edgarallanpoe,"were taking strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen, and"
edgarallanpoe,there was every possibility that his intentions would be finally carried
edgarallanpoe,into effect.
edgarallanpoe,"The three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered the"
edgarallanpoe,forecastle all day. Augustus lay quiet until nearly night. He then freed
edgarallanpoe,"himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his attempt. A bottle"
edgarallanpoe,"was found in one of the berths, and this he filled with water from the"
edgarallanpoe,"pitcher left by Peters, storing his pockets at the same time with cold"
edgarallanpoe,"potatoes. To his great joy he also came across a lantern, with a small"
edgarallanpoe,"piece of tallow candle in it. This he could light at any moment, as he"
edgarallanpoe,had in his possession a box of phosphorus matches. When it was quite
edgarallanpoe,"dark, he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the"
edgarallanpoe,precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey the
edgarallanpoe,"idea of a person covered up. When through, he hung up the pea-jacket"
edgarallanpoe,"on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture--this manoeuvre being"
edgarallanpoe,"easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece of plank taken out"
edgarallanpoe,"until afterward. He was now on the main orlop deck, and proceeded to"
edgarallanpoe,"make his way, as before, between the upper deck and the oil-casks to"
edgarallanpoe,"the main hatchway. Having reached this, he lit the piece of candle, and"
edgarallanpoe,"descended, groping with extreme difficulty among the compact stowage of"
edgarallanpoe,the hold. In a few moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench
edgarallanpoe,and the closeness of the atmosphere. He could not think it possible
edgarallanpoe,that I had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so
edgarallanpoe,"oppressive an air. He called my name repeatedly, but I made him no"
edgarallanpoe,"reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed. The brig was"
edgarallanpoe,"rolling violently, and there was so much noise in consequence, that it"
edgarallanpoe,"was useless to listen for any weak sound, such as those of my breathing"
edgarallanpoe,"or snoring. He threw open the lantern, and held it as high as possible,"
edgarallanpoe,"whenever an opportunity occurred, in order that, by observing the light,"
edgarallanpoe,"I might, if alive, be aware that succor was approaching. Still nothing"
edgarallanpoe,"was heard from me, and the supposition of my death began to assume the"
edgarallanpoe,"character of certainty. He determined, nevertheless, to force a passage,"
edgarallanpoe,"if possible, to the box, and at least ascertain beyond a doubt the truth"
edgarallanpoe,of his surmises. He pushed on for some time in a most pitiable state of
edgarallanpoe,"anxiety, until, at length, he found the pathway utterly blocked up, and"
edgarallanpoe,that there was no possibility of making any farther way by the course
edgarallanpoe,"in which he had set out. Overcome now by his feelings, he threw himself"
edgarallanpoe,"among the lumber in despair, and wept like a child. It was at this"
edgarallanpoe,period that he heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which I had
edgarallanpoe,"thrown down. Fortunate, indeed, was it that the incident occurred--for,"
edgarallanpoe,"upon this incident, trivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny"
edgarallanpoe,"depended. Many years elapsed, however, before I was aware of this fact."
edgarallanpoe,A natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision prevented
edgarallanpoe,Augustus from confiding to me at once what a more intimate and
edgarallanpoe,unreserved communion afterward induced him to reveal. Upon finding his
edgarallanpoe,further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he could not
edgarallanpoe,"overcome, he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me, and"
edgarallanpoe,return at once to the forecastle. Before condemning him entirely on this
edgarallanpoe,"head, the harassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken"
edgarallanpoe,"into consideration. The night was fast wearing away, and his absence"
edgarallanpoe,from the forecastle might be discovered; and indeed would necessarily be
edgarallanpoe,"so, if he should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak. His candle"
edgarallanpoe,"was expiring in the socket, and there would be the greatest difficulty"
edgarallanpoe,"in retracing his way to the hatchway in the dark. It must be allowed,"
edgarallanpoe,"too, that he had every good reason to believe me dead; in which event"
edgarallanpoe,"no benefit could result to me from his reaching the box, and a world of"
edgarallanpoe,danger would be encountered to no purpose by himself. He had repeatedly
edgarallanpoe,"called, and I had made him no answer. I had been now eleven days and"
edgarallanpoe,nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had
edgarallanpoe,left with me--a supply which it was not at all probable I had hoarded in
edgarallanpoe,"the beginning of my confinement, as I had every cause to expect a speedy"
edgarallanpoe,"release. The atmosphere of the hold, too, must have appeared to him,"
edgarallanpoe,"coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage, of a nature"
edgarallanpoe,"absolutely poisonous, and by far more intolerable than it had seemed to"
edgarallanpoe,me upon my first taking up my quarters in the box--the hatchways at that
edgarallanpoe,time having been constantly open for many months previous. Add to these
edgarallanpoe,considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so lately
edgarallanpoe,"witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and narrow escapes"
edgarallanpoe,"from death, together with the frail and equivocal tenure by which he"
edgarallanpoe,still existed--circumstances all so well calculated to prostrate every
edgarallanpoe,"energy of mind--and the reader will be easily brought, as I have been,"
edgarallanpoe,to regard his apparent falling off in friendship and in faith with
edgarallanpoe,sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger.
edgarallanpoe,"The crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet Augustus was not sure"
edgarallanpoe,"that it proceeded from the hold. The doubt, however, was sufficient"
edgarallanpoe,inducement to persevere. He clambered up nearly to the orlop deck by
edgarallanpoe,"means of the stowage, and then, watching for a lull in the pitchings of"
edgarallanpoe,"the vessel, he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could command,"
edgarallanpoe,"regardless, for the moment, of being overheard by the crew. It will"
edgarallanpoe,"be remembered that on this occasion the voice reached me, but I was"
edgarallanpoe,so entirely overcome by violent agitation as to be incapable of reply.
edgarallanpoe,"Confident, now, that his worst apprehensions were well founded, he"
edgarallanpoe,"descended, with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss"
edgarallanpoe,"of time. In his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise"
edgarallanpoe,"occasioned by which I heard, as will be recollected. He had made"
edgarallanpoe,considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife again
edgarallanpoe,"caused him to hesitate. He retraced his steps immediately, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"clambering up the stowage a second time, called out my name, loudly as"
edgarallanpoe,"before, having watched for a lull. This time I found voice to answer."
edgarallanpoe,"Overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive, he now resolved to brave"
edgarallanpoe,every difficulty and danger in reaching me. Having extricated himself as
edgarallanpoe,quickly as possible from the labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed
edgarallanpoe,"in, he at length struck into an opening which promised better, and"
edgarallanpoe,"finally, after a series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of"
edgarallanpoe,utter exhaustion.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 6
edgarallanpoe,THE leading particulars of this narration were all that Augustus
edgarallanpoe,communicated to me while we remained near the box. It was not
edgarallanpoe,until afterward that he entered fully into all the details. He was
edgarallanpoe,"apprehensive of being missed, and I was wild with impatience to leave"
edgarallanpoe,my detested place of confinement. We resolved to make our way at once
edgarallanpoe,"to the hole in the bulkhead, near which I was to remain for the present,"
edgarallanpoe,while he went through to reconnoiter. To leave Tiger in the box was what
edgarallanpoe,"neither of us could endure to think of, yet, how to act otherwise was"
edgarallanpoe,"the question. He now seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we could not even"
edgarallanpoe,distinguish the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely
edgarallanpoe,"to the box. I was convinced that he was dead, and determined to open the"
edgarallanpoe,"door. We found him lying at full length, apparently in a deep stupor,"
edgarallanpoe,"yet still alive. No time was to be lost, yet I could not bring myself to"
edgarallanpoe,"abandon an animal who had now been twice instrumental in saving my life,"
edgarallanpoe,without some attempt at preserving him. We therefore dragged him along
edgarallanpoe,"with us as well as we could, although with the greatest difficulty and"
edgarallanpoe,"fatigue; Augustus, during part of the time, being forced to clamber"
edgarallanpoe,over the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his arms--a feat
edgarallanpoe,to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally inadequate. At
edgarallanpoe,"length we succeeded in reaching the hole, when Augustus got through, and"
edgarallanpoe,"Tiger was pushed in afterward. All was found to be safe, and we did"
edgarallanpoe,not fail to return sincere thanks to God for our deliverance from the
edgarallanpoe,"imminent danger we had escaped. For the present, it was agreed that I"
edgarallanpoe,"should remain near the opening, through which my companion could readily"
edgarallanpoe,"supply me with a part of his daily provision, and where I could have the"
edgarallanpoe,advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure.
edgarallanpoe,"In explanation of some portions of this narrative, wherein I have spoken"
edgarallanpoe,"of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous to some of my"
edgarallanpoe,"readers who may have seen a proper or regular stowage, I must here state"
edgarallanpoe,that the manner in which this most important duty had been performed
edgarallanpoe,on board the Grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on the part
edgarallanpoe,"of Captain Barnard, who was by no means as careful or as experienced a"
edgarallanpoe,seaman as the hazardous nature of the service on which he was
edgarallanpoe,employed would seem necessarily to demand. A proper stowage cannot be
edgarallanpoe,"accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous accidents,"
edgarallanpoe,"even within the limits of my own experience, have arisen from neglect"
edgarallanpoe,"or ignorance in this particular. Coasting vessels, in the frequent hurry"
edgarallanpoe,"and bustle attendant upon taking in or discharging cargo, are the most"
edgarallanpoe,liable to mishap from the want of a proper attention to stowage. The
edgarallanpoe,great point is to allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting
edgarallanpoe,"position even in the most violent rollings of the vessel. With this end,"
edgarallanpoe,"great attention must be paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but to the"
edgarallanpoe,"nature of the bulk, and whether there be a full or only a partial cargo."
edgarallanpoe,In most kinds of freight the stowage is accomplished by means of a
edgarallanpoe,"screw. Thus, in a load of tobacco or flour, the whole is screwed so"
edgarallanpoe,"tightly into the hold of the vessel that the barrels or hogsheads, upon"
edgarallanpoe,"discharging, are found to be completely flattened, and take some time"
edgarallanpoe,"to regain their original shape. This screwing, however, is resorted to"
edgarallanpoe,principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold; for in a
edgarallanpoe,"full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco, there can be no"
edgarallanpoe,"danger of any shifting whatever, at least none from which inconvenience"
edgarallanpoe,"can result. There have been instances, indeed, where this method of"
edgarallanpoe,"screwing has resulted in the most lamentable consequences, arising from"
edgarallanpoe,a cause altogether distinct from the danger attendant upon a shifting of
edgarallanpoe,"cargo. A load of cotton, for example, tightly screwed while in certain"
edgarallanpoe,"conditions, has been known, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a"
edgarallanpoe,vessel asunder at sea. There can be no doubt either that the same result
edgarallanpoe,"would ensue in the case of tobacco, while undergoing its usual course"
edgarallanpoe,"of fermentation, were it not for the interstices consequent upon the"
edgarallanpoe,rotundity of the hogsheads.
edgarallanpoe,It is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to be
edgarallanpoe,"apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be always taken"
edgarallanpoe,to guard against such misfortune. Only those who have encountered a
edgarallanpoe,"violent gale of wind, or rather who have experienced the rolling of"
edgarallanpoe,"a vessel in a sudden calm after the gale, can form an idea of the"
edgarallanpoe,"tremendous force of the plunges, and of the consequent terrible impetus"
edgarallanpoe,given to all loose articles in the vessel. It is then that the necessity
edgarallanpoe,"of a cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious."
edgarallanpoe,"When lying-to (especially with a small head sail), a vessel which is not"
edgarallanpoe,properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon her beam-ends;
edgarallanpoe,"this occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon an average, yet"
edgarallanpoe,"without any serious consequences resulting, provided there be a proper"
edgarallanpoe,"stowage. If this, however, has not been strictly attended to, in the"
edgarallanpoe,first of these heavy lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the
edgarallanpoe,"side of the vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented"
edgarallanpoe,"from regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do,"
edgarallanpoe,she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down. It is not too much
edgarallanpoe,to say that at least one-half of the instances in which vessels have
edgarallanpoe,foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to a shifting of cargo
edgarallanpoe,or of ballast.
edgarallanpoe,"When a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole, after"
edgarallanpoe,"being first stowed as compactly as may be, should be covered with a"
edgarallanpoe,"layer of stout shifting-boards, extending completely across the vessel."
edgarallanpoe,"Upon these boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected,"
edgarallanpoe,"reaching to the timbers above, and thus securing every thing in its"
edgarallanpoe,"place. In cargoes consisting of grain, or any similar matter, additional"
edgarallanpoe,precautions are requisite. A hold filled entirely with grain upon
edgarallanpoe,leaving port will be found not more than three fourths full upon
edgarallanpoe,"reaching its destination--this, too, although the freight, when measured"
edgarallanpoe,"bushel by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on"
edgarallanpoe,account of the swelling of the grain) the quantity consigned. This
edgarallanpoe,"result is occasioned by settling during the voyage, and is the more"
edgarallanpoe,perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the weather experienced.
edgarallanpoe,"If grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then, is ever so well secured by"
edgarallanpoe,"shifting-boards and stanchions, it will be liable to shift in a long"
edgarallanpoe,passage so greatly as to bring about the most distressing calamities.
edgarallanpoe,"To prevent these, every method should be employed before leaving port"
edgarallanpoe,to settle the cargo as much as possible; and for this there are many
edgarallanpoe,"contrivances, among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into"
edgarallanpoe,"the grain. Even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to"
edgarallanpoe,"secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about will"
edgarallanpoe,feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a cargo of
edgarallanpoe,"grain on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo. Yet there are"
edgarallanpoe,"hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is likely, many more from the"
edgarallanpoe,"ports of Europe, which sail daily with partial cargoes, even of the most"
edgarallanpoe,"dangerous species, and without any precaution whatever. The wonder"
edgarallanpoe,is that no more accidents occur than do actually happen. A lamentable
edgarallanpoe,instance of this heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of
edgarallanpoe,"Captain Joel Rice of the schooner Firefly, which sailed from Richmond,"
edgarallanpoe,"Virginia, to Madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year 1825. The"
edgarallanpoe,"captain had gone many voyages without serious accident, although he was"
edgarallanpoe,"in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his stowage, more than"
edgarallanpoe,to secure it in the ordinary manner. He had never before sailed with
edgarallanpoe,"a cargo of grain, and on this occasion had the corn thrown on board"
edgarallanpoe,"loosely, when it did not much more than half fill the vessel. For the"
edgarallanpoe,first portion of the voyage he met with nothing more than light breezes;
edgarallanpoe,but when within a day’s sail of Madeira there came on a strong gale from
edgarallanpoe,the N. N. E. which forced him to lie-to. He brought the schooner to the
edgarallanpoe,"wind under a double-reefed foresail alone, when she rode as well as any"
edgarallanpoe,"vessel could be expected to do, and shipped not a drop of water. Toward"
edgarallanpoe,"night the gale somewhat abated, and she rolled with more unsteadiness"
edgarallanpoe,"than before, but still did very well, until a heavy lurch threw her upon"
edgarallanpoe,"her beam-ends to starboard. The corn was then heard to shift bodily, the"
edgarallanpoe,force of the movement bursting open the main hatchway. The vessel
edgarallanpoe,went down like a shot. This happened within hail of a small sloop from
edgarallanpoe,"Madeira, which picked up one of the crew (the only person saved), and"
edgarallanpoe,"which rode out the gale in perfect security, as indeed a jolly boat"
edgarallanpoe,might have done under proper management.
edgarallanpoe,"The stowage on board the Grampus was most clumsily done, if stowage"
edgarallanpoe,that could be called which was little better than a promiscuous huddling
edgarallanpoe,together of oil-casks {*1} and ship furniture. I have already spoken of
edgarallanpoe,the condition of articles in the hold. On the orlop deck there was space
edgarallanpoe,enough for my body (as I have stated) between the oil-casks and the
edgarallanpoe,upper deck; a space was left open around the main hatchway; and several
edgarallanpoe,other large spaces were left in the stowage. Near the hole cut through
edgarallanpoe,"the bulkhead by Augustus there was room enough for an entire cask, and"
edgarallanpoe,in this space I found myself comfortably situated for the present.
edgarallanpoe,"By the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and readjusted"
edgarallanpoe,"his handcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight. We had made a narrow"
edgarallanpoe,"escape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all matters, when the mate"
edgarallanpoe,"came below, with Dirk Peters and the cook. They talked for some time"
edgarallanpoe,"about the vessel from the Cape Verds, and seemed to be excessively"
edgarallanpoe,anxious for her appearance. At length the cook came to the berth in
edgarallanpoe,"which Augustus was lying, and seated himself in it near the head. I"
edgarallanpoe,"could see and hear every thing from my hiding-place, for the piece cut"
edgarallanpoe,"out had not been put back, and I was in momentary expectation that the"
edgarallanpoe,"negro would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal"
edgarallanpoe,"the aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and our"
edgarallanpoe,"lives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed. Our good fortune"
edgarallanpoe,"prevailed, however; and although he frequently touched it as the vessel"
edgarallanpoe,"rolled, he never pressed against it sufficiently to bring about a"
edgarallanpoe,discovery. The bottom of the jacket had been carefully fastened to the
edgarallanpoe,"bulkhead, so that the hole might not be seen by its swinging to one"
edgarallanpoe,"side. All this time Tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and"
edgarallanpoe,"appeared to have recovered in some measure his faculties, for I could"
edgarallanpoe,see him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath.
edgarallanpoe,"After a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving Dirk Peters"
edgarallanpoe,"behind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat himself down in"
edgarallanpoe,the place just occupied by the mate. He began to talk very sociably with
edgarallanpoe,"Augustus, and we could now see that the greater part of his apparent"
edgarallanpoe,"intoxication, while the two others were with him, was a feint. He"
edgarallanpoe,answered all my companion’s questions with perfect freedom; told him
edgarallanpoe,"that he had no doubt of his father’s having been picked up, as there"
edgarallanpoe,were no less than five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he
edgarallanpoe,"was cut adrift; and used other language of a consolatory nature,"
edgarallanpoe,"which occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure. Indeed, I began to"
edgarallanpoe,"entertain hopes, that through the instrumentality of Peters we might"
edgarallanpoe,"be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig, and this idea I"
edgarallanpoe,mentioned to Augustus as soon as I found an opportunity. He thought
edgarallanpoe,"the matter possible, but urged the necessity of the greatest caution"
edgarallanpoe,"in making the attempt, as the conduct of the hybrid appeared to be"
edgarallanpoe,"instigated by the most arbitrary caprice alone; and, indeed, it was"
edgarallanpoe,difficult to say if he was at any moment of sound mind. Peters went
edgarallanpoe,"upon deck in about an hour, and did not return again until noon, when he"
edgarallanpoe,"brought Augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding. Of this,"
edgarallanpoe,"when we were left alone, I partook heartily, without returning through"
edgarallanpoe,"the hole. No one else came down into the forecastle during the day, and"
edgarallanpoe,"at night, I got into Augustus’ berth, where I slept soundly and sweetly"
edgarallanpoe,"until nearly daybreak, when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon"
edgarallanpoe,"deck, and I regained my hiding-place as quickly as possible. When the"
edgarallanpoe,"day was fully broke, we found that Tiger had recovered his strength"
edgarallanpoe,"almost entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia, drinking a"
edgarallanpoe,little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness. During
edgarallanpoe,the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite. His strange
edgarallanpoe,"conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the deleterious quality of the"
edgarallanpoe,"air of the hold, and had no connexion with canine madness. I could not"
edgarallanpoe,sufficiently rejoice that I had persisted in bringing him with me from
edgarallanpoe,"the box. This day was the thirtieth of June, and the thirteenth since"
edgarallanpoe,the Grampus made sail from Nantucket.
edgarallanpoe,"On the second of July the mate came below drunk as usual, and in an"
edgarallanpoe,"excessively good-humor. He came to Augustus’s berth, and, giving him a"
edgarallanpoe,"slap on the back, asked him if he thought he could behave himself if"
edgarallanpoe,"he let him loose, and whether he would promise not to be going into the"
edgarallanpoe,"cabin again. To this, of course, my friend answered in the affirmative,"
edgarallanpoe,"when the ruffian set him at liberty, after making him drink from a flask"
edgarallanpoe,"of rum which he drew from his coat-pocket. Both now went on deck, and I"
edgarallanpoe,did not see Augustus for about three hours. He then came below with the
edgarallanpoe,good news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he
edgarallanpoe,"pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been ordered"
edgarallanpoe,"to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle. He brought me, too, a good"
edgarallanpoe,"dinner, and a plentiful supply of water. The brig was still cruising for"
edgarallanpoe,"the vessel from the Cape Verds, and a sail was now in sight, which was"
edgarallanpoe,thought to be the one in question. As the events of the ensuing eight
edgarallanpoe,"days were of little importance, and had no direct bearing upon the main"
edgarallanpoe,"incidents of my narrative, I will here throw them into the form of a"
edgarallanpoe,"journal, as I do not wish to omit them altogether."
edgarallanpoe,"July 3. Augustus furnished me with three blankets, with which I"
edgarallanpoe,"contrived a comfortable bed in my hiding-place. No one came below,"
edgarallanpoe,"except my companion, during the day. Tiger took his station in the"
edgarallanpoe,"berth just by the aperture, and slept heavily, as if not yet entirely"
edgarallanpoe,recovered from the effects of his sickness. Toward night a flaw of wind
edgarallanpoe,"struck the brig before sail could be taken in, and very nearly capsized"
edgarallanpoe,"her. The puff died away immediately, however, and no damage was done"
edgarallanpoe,beyond the splitting of the foretopsail. Dirk Peters treated Augustus
edgarallanpoe,all this day with great kindness and entered into a long conversation
edgarallanpoe,"with him respecting the Pacific Ocean, and the islands he had visited"
edgarallanpoe,in that region. He asked him whether he would not like to go with the
edgarallanpoe,"mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those quarters,"
edgarallanpoe,and said that the men were gradually coming over to the mate’s views.
edgarallanpoe,To this Augustus thought it best to reply that he would be glad to go
edgarallanpoe,"on such an adventure, since nothing better could be done, and that any"
edgarallanpoe,thing was preferable to a piratical life.
edgarallanpoe,"July 4th. The vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from Liverpool,"
edgarallanpoe,and was allowed to pass unmolested. Augustus spent most of his time
edgarallanpoe,"on deck, with a view of obtaining all the information in his power"
edgarallanpoe,respecting the intentions of the mutineers. They had frequent and
edgarallanpoe,"violent quarrels among themselves, in one of which a harpooner, Jim"
edgarallanpoe,"Bonner, was thrown overboard. The party of the mate was gaining ground."
edgarallanpoe,"Jim Bonner belonged to the cook’s gang, of which Peters was a partisan."
edgarallanpoe,"July 5th. About daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the west,"
edgarallanpoe,"which at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could carry"
edgarallanpoe,nothing more than her trysail and foresail. In taking in the
edgarallanpoe,"foretopsail, Simms, one of the common hands, and belonging also to"
edgarallanpoe,"the cook’s gang, fell overboard, being very much in liquor, and was"
edgarallanpoe,drowned--no attempt being made to save him. The whole number of persons
edgarallanpoe,"on board was now thirteen, to wit: Dirk Peters; Seymour, the black"
edgarallanpoe,"cook; Jones, Greely, Hartman Rogers and William Allen, all of the"
edgarallanpoe,"cook’s party; the mate, whose name I never"
edgarallanpoe,"learned; Absalom Hicks, Wilson, John Hunty Richard Parker, of the mate’s"
edgarallanpoe,party;--besides Augustus and myself.
edgarallanpoe,"July 6th. The gale lasted all this day, blowing in heavy squalls,"
edgarallanpoe,accompanied with rain. The brig took in a good deal of water through her
edgarallanpoe,"seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually going, Augustus being"
edgarallanpoe,forced to take his turn. Just at twilight a large ship passed close
edgarallanpoe,"by us, without having been discovered until within hail. The ship was"
edgarallanpoe,supposed to be the one for which the mutineers were on the lookout. The
edgarallanpoe,"mate hailed her, but the reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale."
edgarallanpoe,"At eleven, a sea was shipped amidships, which tore away a great portion"
edgarallanpoe,"of the larboard bulwarks, and did some other slight damage. Toward"
edgarallanpoe,"morning the weather moderated, and at sunrise there was very little"
edgarallanpoe,wind.
edgarallanpoe,"July 7th. There was a heavy swell running all this day, during which the"
edgarallanpoe,"brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many articles broke loose in"
edgarallanpoe,"the hold, as I could hear distinctly from my hiding-place. I suffered"
edgarallanpoe,a great deal from sea-sickness. Peters had a long conversation this day
edgarallanpoe,"with Augustus, and told him that two of his gang, Greely and Allen, had"
edgarallanpoe,"gone over to the mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. He put several"
edgarallanpoe,questions to Augustus which he did not then exactly understand. During
edgarallanpoe,a part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little could
edgarallanpoe,"be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brig's straining, and"
edgarallanpoe,"taking in the water through her seams. A sail was thrummed, and got"
edgarallanpoe,"under the bows, which aided us in some measure, so that we began to gain"
edgarallanpoe,upon the leak.
edgarallanpoe,"July 8th. A light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward, when"
edgarallanpoe,"the mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the intention of making"
edgarallanpoe,some of the West India islands in pursuance of his piratical designs. No
edgarallanpoe,opposition was made by Peters or the cook--at least none in the hearing
edgarallanpoe,of Augustus. All idea of taking the vessel from the Cape Verds was
edgarallanpoe,abandoned. The leak was now easily kept under by one pump going every
edgarallanpoe,three quarters of an hour. The sail was drawn from beneath the bows.
edgarallanpoe,Spoke two small schooners during the day.
edgarallanpoe,July 9th. Fine weather. All hands employed in repairing bulwarks. Peters
edgarallanpoe,"had again a long conversation with Augustus, and spoke more plainly than"
edgarallanpoe,he had done heretofore. He said nothing should induce him to come into
edgarallanpoe,"the mate’s views, and even hinted his intention of taking the brig out"
edgarallanpoe,of his hands. He asked my friend if he could depend upon his aid in such
edgarallanpoe,"case, to which Augustus said, “Yes,” without hesitation. Peters then"
edgarallanpoe,"said he would sound the others of his party upon the subject, and went"
edgarallanpoe,away. During the remainder of the day Augustus had no opportunity of
edgarallanpoe,speaking with him privately.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 7
edgarallanpoe,"JULY 10. Spoke a brig from Rio, bound to Norfolk. Weather hazy, with"
edgarallanpoe,"a light baffling wind from the eastward. To-day Hartman Rogers died,"
edgarallanpoe,having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass of
edgarallanpoe,"grog. This man was of the cook’s party, and one upon whom Peters placed"
edgarallanpoe,his main reliance. He told Augustus that he believed the mate had
edgarallanpoe,"poisoned him, and that he expected, if he did not be on the look-out,"
edgarallanpoe,"his own turn would come shortly. There were now only himself, Jones, and"
edgarallanpoe,the cook belonging to his own gang--on the other side there were five.
edgarallanpoe,He had spoken to Jones about taking the command from the mate; but the
edgarallanpoe,"project having been coolly received, he had been deterred from pressing"
edgarallanpoe,"the matter any further, or from saying any thing to the cook. It was"
edgarallanpoe,"well, as it happened, that he was so prudent, for in the afternoon the"
edgarallanpoe,"cook expressed his determination of siding with the mate, and went over"
edgarallanpoe,formally to that party; while Jones took an opportunity of quarrelling
edgarallanpoe,"with Peters, and hinted that he would let the mate know of the plan"
edgarallanpoe,"in agitation. There was now, evidently, no time to be lost, and Peters"
edgarallanpoe,expressed his determination of attempting to take the vessel at all
edgarallanpoe,"hazards, provided Augustus would lend him his aid. My friend at once"
edgarallanpoe,"assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that purpose,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made known the fact"
edgarallanpoe,of my being on board. At this the hybrid was not more astonished than
edgarallanpoe,"delighted, as he had no reliance whatever upon Jones, whom he already"
edgarallanpoe,considered as belonging to the party of the mate. They went below
edgarallanpoe,"immediately, when Augustus called to me by name, and Peters and myself"
edgarallanpoe,were soon made acquainted. It was agreed that we should attempt to
edgarallanpoe,"retake the vessel upon the first good opportunity, leaving Jones"
edgarallanpoe,"altogether out of our councils. In the event of success, we were to"
edgarallanpoe,"run the brig into the first port that offered, and deliver her up. The"
edgarallanpoe,desertion of his party had frustrated Peters’ design of going into the
edgarallanpoe,"Pacific--an adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew,"
edgarallanpoe,"and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial, on the score"
edgarallanpoe,of insanity (which he solemnly avowed had actuated him in lending his
edgarallanpoe,"aid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a pardon, if found guilty, through"
edgarallanpoe,the representations of Augustus and myself. Our deliberations were
edgarallanpoe,"interrupted for the present by the cry of, “All hands take in sail,” and"
edgarallanpoe,Peters and Augustus ran up on deck.
edgarallanpoe,"As usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could be"
edgarallanpoe,"properly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her beam-ends. By"
edgarallanpoe,"keeping her away, however, she righted, having shipped a good deal of"
edgarallanpoe,"water. Scarcely was everything secure, when another squall took the"
edgarallanpoe,"vessel, and immediately afterward another--no damage being done. There"
edgarallanpoe,"was every appearance of a gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came on,"
edgarallanpoe,"with great fury, from the northward and westward. All was made as snug"
edgarallanpoe,"as possible, and we laid-to, as usual, under a close-reefed foresail. As"
edgarallanpoe,"night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with a remarkably heavy"
edgarallanpoe,"sea. Peters now came into the forecastle with Augustus, and we resumed"
edgarallanpoe,our deliberations.
edgarallanpoe,We agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the present
edgarallanpoe,"for carrying our designs into effect, as an attempt at such a moment"
edgarallanpoe,"would never be anticipated. As the brig was snugly laid-to, there would"
edgarallanpoe,"be no necessity of manoeuvring her until good weather, when, if we"
edgarallanpoe,"succeeded in our attempt, we might liberate one, or perhaps two of the"
edgarallanpoe,"men, to aid us in taking her into port. The main difficulty was the"
edgarallanpoe,"great disproportion in our forces. There were only three of us, and in"
edgarallanpoe,"the cabin there were nine. All the arms on board, too, were in their"
edgarallanpoe,"possession, with the exception of a pair of small pistols which Peters"
edgarallanpoe,"had concealed about his person, and the large seaman’s knife which"
edgarallanpoe,he always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons. From certain
edgarallanpoe,"indications, too--such, for example, as there being no such thing as"
edgarallanpoe,an axe or a handspike lying in their customary places--we began to fear
edgarallanpoe,"that the mate had his suspicions, at least in regard to Peters, and that"
edgarallanpoe,"he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid of him. It was clear,"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed, that what we should determine to do could not be done too soon."
edgarallanpoe,Still the odds were too much against us to allow of our proceeding
edgarallanpoe,without the greatest caution.
edgarallanpoe,"Peters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into"
edgarallanpoe,"conversation with the watch (Allen), when he would be able to throw him"
edgarallanpoe,"into the sea without trouble, and without making any disturbance, by"
edgarallanpoe,"seizing a good opportunity, that Augustus and myself should then come"
edgarallanpoe,"up, and endeavour to provide ourselves with some kind of weapons from"
edgarallanpoe,"the deck, and that we should then make a rush together, and secure the"
edgarallanpoe,companion-way before any opposition could be offered. I objected to
edgarallanpoe,"this, because I could not believe that the mate (who was a cunning"
edgarallanpoe,fellow in all matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices)
edgarallanpoe,would suffer himself to be so easily entrapped. The very fact of there
edgarallanpoe,being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was upon the
edgarallanpoe,"alert,--it not being usual except in vessels where discipline is most"
edgarallanpoe,"rigidly enforced, to station a watch on deck when a vessel is lying-to"
edgarallanpoe,"in a gale of wind. As I address myself principally, if not altogether,"
edgarallanpoe,"to persons who have never been to sea, it may be as well to state the"
edgarallanpoe,"exact condition of a vessel under such circumstances. Lying-to, or,"
edgarallanpoe,"in sea-parlance, “laying-to,” is a measure resorted to for various"
edgarallanpoe,"purposes, and effected in various manners. In moderate weather it"
edgarallanpoe,is frequently done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a
edgarallanpoe,"stand-still, to wait for another vessel or any similar object. If"
edgarallanpoe,"the vessel which lies-to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually"
edgarallanpoe,"accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails, so as to let"
edgarallanpoe,"the wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary. But we are now"
edgarallanpoe,speaking of lying-to in a gale of wind. This is done when the wind
edgarallanpoe,"is ahead, and too violent to admit of carrying sail without danger of"
edgarallanpoe,"capsizing; and sometimes even when the wind is fair, but the sea too"
edgarallanpoe,heavy for the vessel to be put before it. If a vessel be suffered to
edgarallanpoe,"scud before the wind in a very heavy sea, much damage is usually done"
edgarallanpoe,"her by the shipping of water over her stern, and sometimes by the"
edgarallanpoe,"violent plunges she makes forward. This manoeuvre, then, is seldom"
edgarallanpoe,"resorted to in such case, unless through necessity. When the vessel"
edgarallanpoe,is in a leaky condition she is often put before the wind even in the
edgarallanpoe,"heaviest seas; for, when lying-to, her seams are sure to be greatly"
edgarallanpoe,"opened by her violent straining, and it is not so much the case when"
edgarallanpoe,"scudding. Often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel, either when"
edgarallanpoe,the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in pieces the sail which
edgarallanpoe,"is employed with a view of bringing her head to the wind, or when,"
edgarallanpoe,"through the false modelling of the frame or other causes, this main"
edgarallanpoe,object cannot be effected.
edgarallanpoe,"Vessels in a gale of wind are laid-to in different manners, according"
edgarallanpoe,"to their peculiar construction. Some lie-to best under a foresail, and"
edgarallanpoe,"this, I believe, is the sail most usually employed. Large square-rigged"
edgarallanpoe,"vessels have sails for the express purpose, called storm-staysails."
edgarallanpoe,"But the jib is occasionally employed by itself,--sometimes the jib"
edgarallanpoe,"and foresail, or a double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the"
edgarallanpoe,"after-sails, are made use of. Foretopsails are very often found to"
edgarallanpoe,answer the purpose better than any other species of sail. The Grampus
edgarallanpoe,was generally laid-to under a close-reefed foresail.
edgarallanpoe,"When a vessel is to be laid-to, her head is brought up to the wind just"
edgarallanpoe,"so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when hauled flat aft,"
edgarallanpoe,"that is, when brought diagonally across the vessel. This being done,"
edgarallanpoe,the bows point within a few degrees of the direction from which the wind
edgarallanpoe,"issues, and the windward bow of course receives the shock of the waves."
edgarallanpoe,In this situation a good vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind
edgarallanpoe,"without shipping a drop of water, and without any further attention"
edgarallanpoe,being requisite on the part of the crew. The helm is usually lashed
edgarallanpoe,"down, but this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of the noise"
edgarallanpoe,"it makes when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel when"
edgarallanpoe,"lying-to. Indeed, the helm had far better be left loose than lashed very"
edgarallanpoe,"fast, for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy seas if there be no"
edgarallanpoe,"room for the helm to play. As long as the sail holds, a well modelled"
edgarallanpoe,"vessel will maintain her situation, and ride every sea, as if instinct"
edgarallanpoe,"with life and reason. If the violence of the wind, however, should tear"
edgarallanpoe,the sail into pieces (a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to
edgarallanpoe,"accomplish under ordinary circumstances), there is then imminent danger."
edgarallanpoe,"The vessel falls off from the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea,"
edgarallanpoe,is completely at its mercy: the only resource in this case is to put her
edgarallanpoe,"quietly before the wind, letting her scud until some other sail can be"
edgarallanpoe,"set. Some vessels will lie-to under no sail whatever, but such are not"
edgarallanpoe,to be trusted at sea.
edgarallanpoe,But to return from this digression. It had never been customary with the
edgarallanpoe,"mate to have any watch on deck when lying-to in a gale of wind, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"fact that he had now one, coupled with the circumstance of the missing"
edgarallanpoe,"axes and handspikes, fully convinced us that the crew were too well on"
edgarallanpoe,the watch to be taken by surprise in the manner Peters had suggested.
edgarallanpoe,"Something, however, was to be done, and that with as little delay as"
edgarallanpoe,"practicable, for there could be no doubt that a suspicion having"
edgarallanpoe,"been once entertained against Peters, he would be sacrificed upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"earliest occasion, and one would certainly be either found or made upon"
edgarallanpoe,the breaking of the gale.
edgarallanpoe,"Augustus now suggested that if Peters could contrive to remove, under"
edgarallanpoe,"any pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the trap in the"
edgarallanpoe,"stateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon them unawares by means"
edgarallanpoe,of the hold; but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel rolled
edgarallanpoe,and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature.
edgarallanpoe,By good fortune I at length hit upon the idea of working upon the
edgarallanpoe,superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate. It will be
edgarallanpoe,"remembered that one of the crew, Hartman Rogers, had died during the"
edgarallanpoe,"morning, having been attacked two days before with spasms after drinking"
edgarallanpoe,some spirits and water. Peters had expressed to us his opinion that this
edgarallanpoe,"man had been poisoned by the mate, and for this belief he had reasons,"
edgarallanpoe,"so he said, which were incontrovertible, but which he could not be"
edgarallanpoe,prevailed upon to explain to us--this wayward refusal being only in
edgarallanpoe,keeping with other points of his singular character. But whether or not
edgarallanpoe,"he had any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves,"
edgarallanpoe,"we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and determined to act"
edgarallanpoe,accordingly.
edgarallanpoe,"Rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent convulsions;"
edgarallanpoe,and the corpse presented in a few minutes after death one of the most
edgarallanpoe,horrid and loathsome spectacles I ever remember to have seen. The
edgarallanpoe,"stomach was swollen immensely, like that of a man who has been drowned"
edgarallanpoe,and lain under water for many weeks. The hands were in the same
edgarallanpoe,"condition, while the face was shrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky"
edgarallanpoe,"whiteness, except where relieved by two or three glaring red blotches"
edgarallanpoe,like those occasioned by the erysipelas: one of these blotches extended
edgarallanpoe,"diagonally across the face, completely covering up an eye as if with"
edgarallanpoe,a band of red velvet. In this disgusting condition the body had been
edgarallanpoe,"brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown overboard, when the mate"
edgarallanpoe,"getting a glimpse of it (for he now saw it for the first time), and"
edgarallanpoe,being either touched with remorse for his crime or struck with terror at
edgarallanpoe,"so horrible a sight, ordered the men to sew the body up in its"
edgarallanpoe,"hammock, and allow it the usual rites of sea-burial. Having given these"
edgarallanpoe,"directions, he went below, as if to avoid any further sight of his"
edgarallanpoe,"victim. While preparations were making to obey his orders, the gale came"
edgarallanpoe,"on with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the present. The"
edgarallanpoe,"corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard scuppers, where"
edgarallanpoe,"it still lay at the time of which I speak, floundering about with the"
edgarallanpoe,furious lurches of the brig.
edgarallanpoe,"Having arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as"
edgarallanpoe,"speedily as possible. Peters went upon deck, and, as he had anticipated,"
edgarallanpoe,"was immediately accosted by Allen, who appeared to be stationed more as"
edgarallanpoe,a watch upon the forecastle than for any other purpose. The fate of
edgarallanpoe,"this villain, however, was speedily and silently decided; for Peters,"
edgarallanpoe,"approaching him in a careless manner, as if about to address him, seized"
edgarallanpoe,"him by the throat, and, before he could utter a single cry, tossed"
edgarallanpoe,"him over the bulwarks. He then called to us, and we came up. Our first"
edgarallanpoe,"precaution was to look about for something with which to arm ourselves,"
edgarallanpoe,"and in doing this we had to proceed with great care, for it was"
edgarallanpoe,"impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding fast, and"
edgarallanpoe,violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge forward. It was
edgarallanpoe,"indispensable, too, that we should be quick in our operations, for every"
edgarallanpoe,"minute we expected the mate to be up to set the pumps going, as it was"
edgarallanpoe,evident the brig must be taking in water very fast. After searching
edgarallanpoe,"about for some time, we could find nothing more fit for our purpose"
edgarallanpoe,"than the two pump-handles, one of which Augustus took, and I the other."
edgarallanpoe,"Having secured these, we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and"
edgarallanpoe,"dropped the body overboard. Peters and myself then went below, leaving"
edgarallanpoe,"Augustus to watch upon deck, where he took his station just where Allen"
edgarallanpoe,"had been placed, and with his back to the cabin companionway, so that,"
edgarallanpoe,"if any of the mate's gang should come up, he might suppose it was the"
edgarallanpoe,watch.
edgarallanpoe,As soon as I got below I commenced disguising myself so as to represent
edgarallanpoe,the corpse of Rogers. The shirt which we had taken from the body aided
edgarallanpoe,"us very much, for it was of singular form and character, and easily"
edgarallanpoe,"recognizable--a kind of smock, which the deceased wore over his other"
edgarallanpoe,"clothing. It was a blue stockinett, with large white stripes running"
edgarallanpoe,"across. Having put this on, I proceeded to equip myself with a false"
edgarallanpoe,"stomach, in imitation of the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse."
edgarallanpoe,This was soon effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes. I
edgarallanpoe,then gave the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white
edgarallanpoe,"woollen mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that offered"
edgarallanpoe,"themselves. Peters then arranged my face, first rubbing it well over"
edgarallanpoe,"with white chalk, and afterward blotching it with blood, which he took"
edgarallanpoe,from a cut in his finger. The streak across the eye was not forgotten
edgarallanpoe,and presented a most shocking appearance.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 8
edgarallanpoe,AS I viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which hung up in
edgarallanpoe,"the cabin, and by the dim light of a kind of battle-lantern, I was"
edgarallanpoe,"so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and at the"
edgarallanpoe,"recollection of the terrific reality which I was thus representing,"
edgarallanpoe,"that I was seized with a violent tremour, and could scarcely summon"
edgarallanpoe,"resolution to go on with my part. It was necessary, however, to act with"
edgarallanpoe,"decision, and Peters and myself went upon deck."
edgarallanpoe,"We there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the bulwarks,"
edgarallanpoe,the three of us crept to the cabin companion-way. It was only partially
edgarallanpoe,"closed, precautions having been taken to prevent its being suddenly"
edgarallanpoe,"pushed to from without, by means of placing billets of wood on the upper"
edgarallanpoe,step so as to interfere with the shutting. We found no difficulty in
edgarallanpoe,getting a full view of the interior of the cabin through the cracks
edgarallanpoe,where the hinges were placed. It now proved to have been very fortunate
edgarallanpoe,"for us that we had not attempted to take them by surprise, for they were"
edgarallanpoe,"evidently on the alert. Only one was asleep, and he lying just at the"
edgarallanpoe,"foot of the companion-ladder, with a musket by his side. The rest were"
edgarallanpoe,"seated on several mattresses, which had been taken from the berths and"
edgarallanpoe,thrown on the floor. They were engaged in earnest conversation; and
edgarallanpoe,"although they had been carousing, as appeared from two empty jugs, with"
edgarallanpoe,"some tin tumblers which lay about, they were not as much intoxicated"
edgarallanpoe,"as usual. All had knives, one or two of them pistols, and a great many"
edgarallanpoe,muskets were lying in a berth close at hand.
edgarallanpoe,We listened to their conversation for some time before we could make
edgarallanpoe,"up our minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing determinate,"
edgarallanpoe,"except that we would attempt to paralyze their exertions, when we should"
edgarallanpoe,"attack them, by means of the apparition of Rogers. They were discussing"
edgarallanpoe,"their piratical plans, in which all we could hear distinctly was, that"
edgarallanpoe,"they would unite with the crew of a schooner _Hornet_, and, if possible,"
edgarallanpoe,get the schooner herself into their possession preparatory to some
edgarallanpoe,"attempt on a large scale, the particulars of which could not be made out"
edgarallanpoe,by either of us.
edgarallanpoe,"One of the men spoke of Peters, when the mate replied to him in a low"
edgarallanpoe,"voice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added more"
edgarallanpoe,"loudly, that “he could not understand his being so much forward with the"
edgarallanpoe,"captain’s brat in the forecastle, and he thought the sooner both of them"
edgarallanpoe,"were overboard the better.” To this no answer was made, but we could"
edgarallanpoe,"easily perceive that the hint was well received by the whole party, and"
edgarallanpoe,"more particularly by Jones. At this period I was excessively agitated,"
edgarallanpoe,the more so as I could see that neither Augustus nor Peters could
edgarallanpoe,"determine how to act. I made up my mind, however, to sell my life as"
edgarallanpoe,"dearly as possible, and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any"
edgarallanpoe,feelings of trepidation.
edgarallanpoe,"The tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the rigging, and"
edgarallanpoe,"the washing of the sea over the deck, prevented us from hearing what was"
edgarallanpoe,"said, except during momentary lulls. In one of these, we all distinctly"
edgarallanpoe,"heard the mate tell one of the men to “go forward, have an eye upon"
edgarallanpoe,"them, for he wanted no such secret doings on board the brig.” It was"
edgarallanpoe,well for us that the pitching of the vessel at this moment was so
edgarallanpoe,violent as to prevent this order from being carried into instant
edgarallanpoe,"execution. The cook got up from his mattress to go for us, when a"
edgarallanpoe,"tremendous lurch, which I thought would carry away the masts, threw him"
edgarallanpoe,"headlong against one of the larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open,"
edgarallanpoe,"and creating a good deal of other confusion. Luckily, neither of"
edgarallanpoe,"our party was thrown from his position, and we had time to make a"
edgarallanpoe,"precipitate retreat to the forecastle, and arrange a hurried plan of"
edgarallanpoe,"action before the messenger made his appearance, or rather before he put"
edgarallanpoe,"his head out of the companion-hatch, for he did not come on deck."
edgarallanpoe,"From this station he could not notice the absence of Allen, and he"
edgarallanpoe,"accordingly bawled out, as if to him, repeating the orders of the"
edgarallanpoe,"mate. Peters cried out, “Ay, ay,” in a disguised voice, and the cook"
edgarallanpoe,"immediately went below, without entertaining a suspicion that all was"
edgarallanpoe,not right.
edgarallanpoe,"My two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin,"
edgarallanpoe,Peters closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it.
edgarallanpoe,"The mate received them with feigned cordiality, and told Augustus that,"
edgarallanpoe,"since he had behaved himself so well of late, he might take up his"
edgarallanpoe,quarters in the cabin and be one of them for the future. He then poured
edgarallanpoe,"him out a tumbler half full of rum, and made him drink it. All this I"
edgarallanpoe,"saw and heard, for I followed my friends to the cabin as soon as the"
edgarallanpoe,"door was shut, and took up my old point of observation. I had"
edgarallanpoe,"brought with me the two pump-handles, one of which I secured near the"
edgarallanpoe,"companion-way, to be ready for use when required."
edgarallanpoe,I now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good view of
edgarallanpoe,"all that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve myself to the task"
edgarallanpoe,of descending among the mutineers when Peters should make a signal to
edgarallanpoe,"me, as agreed upon. Presently he contrived to turn the conversation upon"
edgarallanpoe,"the bloody deeds of the mutiny, and by degrees led the men to talk"
edgarallanpoe,of the thousand superstitions which are so universally current among
edgarallanpoe,"seamen. I could not make out all that was said, but I could plainly see"
edgarallanpoe,the effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present.
edgarallanpoe,"The mate was evidently much agitated, and presently, when some one"
edgarallanpoe,"mentioned the terrific appearance of Rogers’ corpse, I thought he was"
edgarallanpoe,upon the point of swooning. Peters now asked him if he did not think it
edgarallanpoe,would be better to have the body thrown overboard at once as it was too
edgarallanpoe,horrible a sight to see it floundering about in the scuppers. At this
edgarallanpoe,"the villain absolutely gasped for breath, and turned his head slowly"
edgarallanpoe,"round upon his companions, as if imploring some one to go up and perform"
edgarallanpoe,"the task. No one, however, stirred, and it was quite evident that the"
edgarallanpoe,whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous excitement.
edgarallanpoe,Peters now made me the signal. I immediately threw open the door of the
edgarallanpoe,"companion-way, and, descending, without uttering a syllable, stood erect"
edgarallanpoe,in the midst of the party.
edgarallanpoe,The intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all
edgarallanpoe,to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into
edgarallanpoe,"consideration. Usually, in cases of a similar nature, there is left in"
edgarallanpoe,the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of
edgarallanpoe,"the vision before his eyes; a degree of hope, however feeble, that he"
edgarallanpoe,"is the victim of chicanery, and that the apparition is not actually a"
edgarallanpoe,visitant from the old world of shadows. It is not too much to say that
edgarallanpoe,such remnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such
edgarallanpoe,"visitation, and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been"
edgarallanpoe,"brought about, is to be attributed, even in the cases most in point,"
edgarallanpoe,"and where most suffering has been experienced, more to a kind of"
edgarallanpoe,"anticipative horror, lest the apparition might possibly be real, than"
edgarallanpoe,"to an unwavering belief in its reality. But, in the present instance, it"
edgarallanpoe,"will be seen immediately, that in the minds of the mutineers there"
edgarallanpoe,was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that
edgarallanpoe,the apparition of Rogers was indeed a revivification of his disgusting
edgarallanpoe,"corpse, or at least its spiritual image. The isolated situation of the"
edgarallanpoe,"brig, with its entire inaccessibility on account of the gale, confined"
edgarallanpoe,the apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and
edgarallanpoe,"definite limits, that they must have thought themselves enabled to"
edgarallanpoe,"survey them all at a glance. They had now been at sea twenty-four days,"
edgarallanpoe,without holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel
edgarallanpoe,"whatever. The whole of the crew, too--at least all whom they had the"
edgarallanpoe,most remote reason for suspecting to be on board--were assembled in the
edgarallanpoe,"cabin, with the exception of Allen, the watch; and his gigantic stature"
edgarallanpoe,(he was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in their eyes to
edgarallanpoe,permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their
edgarallanpoe,minds even for an instant. Add to these considerations the awe-inspiring
edgarallanpoe,"nature of the tempest, and that of the conversation brought about by"
edgarallanpoe,Peters; the deep impression which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse
edgarallanpoe,had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men; the excellence
edgarallanpoe,"of the imitation in my person, and the uncertain and wavering light"
edgarallanpoe,"in which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin lantern, swinging"
edgarallanpoe,"violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure, and"
edgarallanpoe,there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than
edgarallanpoe,the entire effect which we had anticipated. The mate sprang up from the
edgarallanpoe,"mattress on which he was lying, and, without uttering a syllable, fell"
edgarallanpoe,"back, stone dead, upon the cabin floor, and was hurled to the leeward"
edgarallanpoe,"like a log by a heavy roll of the brig. Of the remaining seven, there"
edgarallanpoe,were but three who had at first any degree of presence of mind. The
edgarallanpoe,"four others sat for some time rooted apparently to the floor, the most"
edgarallanpoe,pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered.
edgarallanpoe,"The only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook, John Hunt,"
edgarallanpoe,and Richard Parker; but they made but a feeble and irresolute defence.
edgarallanpoe,"The two former were shot instantly by Peters, and I felled Parker with"
edgarallanpoe,a blow on the head from the pump-handle which I had brought with me. In
edgarallanpoe,"the meantime, Augustus seized one of the muskets lying on the floor"
edgarallanpoe,and shot another mutineer Wilson through the breast. There were now but
edgarallanpoe,three remaining; but by this time they had become aroused from their
edgarallanpoe,"lethargy, and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised"
edgarallanpoe,"upon them, for they fought with great resolution and fury, and, but for"
edgarallanpoe,"the immense muscular strength of Peters, might have ultimately got the"
edgarallanpoe,"better of us. These three men were--Jones, Greely, and Absolom Hicks."
edgarallanpoe,"Jones had thrown Augustus to the floor, stabbed him in several places"
edgarallanpoe,"along the right arm, and would no doubt have soon dispatched him"
edgarallanpoe,(as neither Peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own
edgarallanpoe,"antagonists), had it not been for the timely aid of a friend, upon whose"
edgarallanpoe,"assistance we, surely, had never depended. This friend was no other than"
edgarallanpoe,"Tiger. With a low growl, he bounded into the cabin, at a most critical"
edgarallanpoe,"moment for Augustus, and throwing himself upon Jones, pinned him to the"
edgarallanpoe,"floor in an instant. My friend, however, was now too much injured to"
edgarallanpoe,"render us any aid whatever, and I was so encumbered with my disguise"
edgarallanpoe,that I could do but little. The dog would not leave his hold upon the
edgarallanpoe,"throat of Jones--Peters, nevertheless, was far more than a match for the"
edgarallanpoe,"two men who remained, and would, no doubt, have dispatched them sooner,"
edgarallanpoe,"had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act, and the"
edgarallanpoe,tremendous lurches of the vessel. Presently he was enabled to get hold
edgarallanpoe,"of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor. With this he"
edgarallanpoe,beat out the brains of Greely as he was in the act of discharging a
edgarallanpoe,"musket at me, and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing"
edgarallanpoe,"him in contact with Hicks, he seized him by the throat, and, by dint of"
edgarallanpoe,"sheer strength, strangled him instantaneously. Thus, in far less time"
edgarallanpoe,"than I have taken to tell it, we found ourselves masters of the brig."
edgarallanpoe,The only person of our opponents who was left alive was Richard Parker.
edgarallanpoe,"This man, it will be remembered, I had knocked down with a blow from the"
edgarallanpoe,pump-handle at the commencement of the attack. He now lay motionless by
edgarallanpoe,"the door of the shattered stateroom; but, upon Peters touching him with"
edgarallanpoe,"his foot, he spoke, and entreated for mercy. His head was only slightly"
edgarallanpoe,"cut, and otherwise he had received no injury, having been merely stunned"
edgarallanpoe,"by the blow. He now got up, and, for the present, we secured his hands"
edgarallanpoe,"behind his back. The dog was still growling over Jones; but, upon"
edgarallanpoe,"examination, we found him completely dead, the blood issuing in a stream"
edgarallanpoe,"from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no doubt, by the sharp teeth"
edgarallanpoe,of the animal.
edgarallanpoe,"It was now about one o’clock in the morning, and the wind was still"
edgarallanpoe,"blowing tremendously. The brig evidently laboured much more than usual,"
edgarallanpoe,and it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a
edgarallanpoe,view of easing her in some measure. At almost every roll to leeward
edgarallanpoe,"she shipped a sea, several of which came partially down into the cabin"
edgarallanpoe,"during our scuffle, the hatchway having been left open by myself when I"
edgarallanpoe,"descended. The entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away,"
edgarallanpoe,"as well as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the counter."
edgarallanpoe,"The creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication that it"
edgarallanpoe,"was nearly sprung. To make room for more stowage in the afterhold, the"
edgarallanpoe,heel of this mast had been stepped between decks (a very reprehensible
edgarallanpoe,"practice, occasionally resorted to by ignorant ship-builders), so that"
edgarallanpoe,"it was in imminent danger of working from its step. But, to crown all"
edgarallanpoe,"our difficulties, we plummed the well, and found no less than seven feet"
edgarallanpoe,of water.
edgarallanpoe,"Leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work"
edgarallanpoe,"immediately at the pumps--Parker, of course, being set at liberty to"
edgarallanpoe,assist us in the labour. Augustus’s arm was bound up as well as we could
edgarallanpoe,"effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not much. However, we"
edgarallanpoe,found that we could just manage to keep the leak from gaining upon us
edgarallanpoe,"by having one pump constantly going. As there were only four of us, this"
edgarallanpoe,"was severe labour; but we endeavoured to keep up our spirits, and looked"
edgarallanpoe,"anxiously for daybreak, when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting"
edgarallanpoe,away the mainmast.
edgarallanpoe,"In this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"when the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in the least,"
edgarallanpoe,nor were there any signs of its abating. We now dragged the bodies
edgarallanpoe,on deck and threw them overboard. Our next care was to get rid of the
edgarallanpoe,"mainmast. The necessary preparations having been made, Peters cut away"
edgarallanpoe,"at the mast (having found axes in the cabin), while the rest of us stood"
edgarallanpoe,"by the stays and lanyards. As the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch, the"
edgarallanpoe,"word was given to cut away the weather-lanyards, which being done, the"
edgarallanpoe,"whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea, clear of the brig,"
edgarallanpoe,and without doing any material injury. We now found that the vessel
edgarallanpoe,"did not labour quite as much as before, but our situation was still"
edgarallanpoe,"exceedingly precarious, and in spite of the utmost exertions, we"
edgarallanpoe,could not gain upon the leak without the aid of both pumps. The
edgarallanpoe,little assistance which Augustus could render us was not really of any
edgarallanpoe,"importance. To add to our distress, a heavy sea, striking the brig to"
edgarallanpoe,"the windward, threw her off several points from the wind, and, before"
edgarallanpoe,"she could regain her position, another broke completely over her, and"
edgarallanpoe,hurled her full upon her beam-ends. The ballast now shifted in a mass
edgarallanpoe,to leeward (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for
edgarallanpoe,"some time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us from"
edgarallanpoe,"capsizing. Presently, however, we partially righted; but the ballast"
edgarallanpoe,"still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much along that it was"
edgarallanpoe,"useless to think of working the pumps, which indeed we could not have"
edgarallanpoe,"done much longer in any case, as our hands were entirely raw with"
edgarallanpoe,"the excessive labour we had undergone, and were bleeding in the most"
edgarallanpoe,horrible manner.
edgarallanpoe,"Contrary to Parker’s advice, we now proceeded to cut away the foremast,"
edgarallanpoe,"and at length accomplished it after much difficulty, owing to the"
edgarallanpoe,position in which we lay. In going overboard the wreck took with it the
edgarallanpoe,"bowsprit, and left us a complete hulk."
edgarallanpoe,"So far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our longboat,"
edgarallanpoe,which had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come on
edgarallanpoe,board. But we had not long to congratulate ourselves; for the foremast
edgarallanpoe,"having gone, and, of course, the foresail with it, by which the brig had"
edgarallanpoe,"been steadied, every sea now made a complete breach over us, and in"
edgarallanpoe,"five minutes our deck was swept from stem to stern, the longboat"
edgarallanpoe,"and starboard bulwarks torn off, and even the windlass shattered into"
edgarallanpoe,"fragments. It was, indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more"
edgarallanpoe,pitiable condition.
edgarallanpoe,"At noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale’s abating,"
edgarallanpoe,"but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only lulled for a few"
edgarallanpoe,minutes to blow with redoubled fury. About four in the afternoon it was
edgarallanpoe,"utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the blast; and,"
edgarallanpoe,"as the night closed in upon us, I had not a shadow of hope that the"
edgarallanpoe,vessel would hold together until morning.
edgarallanpoe,"By midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now up to"
edgarallanpoe,"the orlop deck. The rudder went soon afterward, the sea which tore it"
edgarallanpoe,"away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water,"
edgarallanpoe,against which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as would
edgarallanpoe,be occasioned by going ashore. We had all calculated that the rudder
edgarallanpoe,"would hold its own to the last, as it was unusually strong, being rigged"
edgarallanpoe,as I have never seen one rigged either before or since. Down its main
edgarallanpoe,"timber there ran a succession of stout iron hooks, and others in the"
edgarallanpoe,same manner down the stern-post. Through these hooks there extended
edgarallanpoe,"a very thick wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus held to the"
edgarallanpoe,stern-post and swinging freely on the rod. The tremendous force of the
edgarallanpoe,"sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact, that the hooks in"
edgarallanpoe,"the stern-post, which ran entirely through it, being clinched on the"
edgarallanpoe,"inside, were drawn every one of them completely out of the solid wood."
edgarallanpoe,"We had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock,"
edgarallanpoe,when one of the most tremendous waves I had then ever known broke right
edgarallanpoe,"on board of us, sweeping the companion-way clear off, bursting in the"
edgarallanpoe,"hatchways, and filling every inch of the vessel with water."
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 9
edgarallanpoe,"LUCKILY, just before night, all four of us had lashed ourselves firmly"
edgarallanpoe,"to the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as flat upon the"
edgarallanpoe,deck as possible. This precaution alone saved us from destruction. As
edgarallanpoe,"it was, we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water"
edgarallanpoe,"which tumbled upon us, and which did not roll from above us until we"
edgarallanpoe,"were nearly exhausted. As soon as I could recover breath, I called aloud"
edgarallanpoe,"to my companions. Augustus alone replied, saying: “It is all over with"
edgarallanpoe,"us, and may God have mercy upon our souls!” By-and-by both the others"
edgarallanpoe,"were enabled to speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as there"
edgarallanpoe,"was still hope; it being impossible, from the nature of the cargo, that"
edgarallanpoe,"the brig could go down, and there being every chance that the gale would"
edgarallanpoe,"blow over by the morning. These words inspired me with new life; for,"
edgarallanpoe,"strange as it may seem, although it was obvious that a vessel with a"
edgarallanpoe,"cargo of empty oil-casks would not sink, I had been hitherto so confused"
edgarallanpoe,in mind as to have overlooked this consideration altogether; and the
edgarallanpoe,danger which I had for some time regarded as the most imminent was
edgarallanpoe,"that of foundering. As hope revived within me, I made use of every"
edgarallanpoe,opportunity to strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains
edgarallanpoe,"of the windlass, and in this occupation I soon discovered that my"
edgarallanpoe,companions were also busy. The night was as dark as it could possibly
edgarallanpoe,"be, and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which surrounded us it"
edgarallanpoe,"is useless to attempt describing. Our deck lay level with the sea, or"
edgarallanpoe,"rather we were encircled with a towering ridge of foam, a portion of"
edgarallanpoe,which swept over us every instant. It is not too much to say that our
edgarallanpoe,heads were not fairly out of the water more than one second in three.
edgarallanpoe,"Although we lay close together, no one of us could see the other,"
edgarallanpoe,"or, indeed, any portion of the brig itself, upon which we were so"
edgarallanpoe,"tempestuously hurled about. At intervals we called one to the other,"
edgarallanpoe,"thus endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and"
edgarallanpoe,encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it. The feeble
edgarallanpoe,condition of Augustus made him an object of solicitude with us all; and
edgarallanpoe,"as, from the lacerated condition of his right arm, it must have been"
edgarallanpoe,impossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of
edgarallanpoe,"firmness, we were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone"
edgarallanpoe,overboard--yet to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the
edgarallanpoe,"question. Fortunately, his station was more secure than that of any"
edgarallanpoe,of the rest of us; for the upper part of his body lying just beneath
edgarallanpoe,"a portion of the shattered windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon"
edgarallanpoe,"him, were greatly broken in their violence. In any other situation than"
edgarallanpoe,this (into which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed
edgarallanpoe,himself in a very exposed spot) he must inevitably have perished before
edgarallanpoe,"morning. Owing to the brig’s lying so much along, we were all less"
edgarallanpoe,liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the case. The
edgarallanpoe,"heel, as I have before stated, was to larboard, about one half of the"
edgarallanpoe,"deck being constantly under water. The seas, therefore, which struck us"
edgarallanpoe,"to starboard were much broken, by the vessel’s side, only reaching us"
edgarallanpoe,in fragments as we lay flat on our faces; while those which came from
edgarallanpoe,"larboard being what are called back-water seas, and obtaining little"
edgarallanpoe,"hold upon us on account of our posture, had not sufficient force to drag"
edgarallanpoe,us from our fastenings.
edgarallanpoe,In this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show
edgarallanpoe,us more fully the horrors which surrounded us. The brig was a mere
edgarallanpoe,"log, rolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale was upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"increase, if any thing, blowing indeed a complete hurricane, and there"
edgarallanpoe,appeared to us no earthly prospect of deliverance. For several hours
edgarallanpoe,"we held on in silence, expecting every moment that our lashings would"
edgarallanpoe,"either give way, that the remains of the windlass would go by the board,"
edgarallanpoe,"or that some of the huge seas, which roared in every direction around"
edgarallanpoe,"us and above us, would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we"
edgarallanpoe,should be drowned before it could regain the surface. By the mercy of
edgarallanpoe,"God, however, we were preserved from these imminent dangers, and about"
edgarallanpoe,midday were cheered by the light of the blessed sun. Shortly afterward
edgarallanpoe,"we could perceive a sensible diminution in the force of the wind, when,"
edgarallanpoe,"now for the first time since the latter part of the evening before,"
edgarallanpoe,"Augustus spoke, asking Peters, who lay closest to him, if he thought"
edgarallanpoe,there was any possibility of our being saved. As no reply was at first
edgarallanpoe,"made to this question, we all concluded that the hybrid had been drowned"
edgarallanpoe,"where he lay; but presently, to our great joy, he spoke, although very"
edgarallanpoe,"feebly, saying that he was in great pain, being so cut by the tightness"
edgarallanpoe,"of his lashings across the stomach, that he must either find means of"
edgarallanpoe,"loosening them or perish, as it was impossible that he could endure"
edgarallanpoe,"his misery much longer. This occasioned us great distress, as it was"
edgarallanpoe,altogether useless to think of aiding him in any manner while the
edgarallanpoe,sea continued washing over us as it did. We exhorted him to bear his
edgarallanpoe,"sufferings with fortitude, and promised to seize the first opportunity"
edgarallanpoe,which should offer itself to relieve him. He replied that it would soon
edgarallanpoe,be too late; that it would be all over with him before we could help
edgarallanpoe,"him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent, when we"
edgarallanpoe,concluded that he had perished.
edgarallanpoe,"As the evening drew on, the sea had fallen so much that scarcely more"
edgarallanpoe,than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five
edgarallanpoe,"minutes, and the wind had abated a great deal, although still blowing a"
edgarallanpoe,"severe gale. I had not heard any of my companions speak for hours, and"
edgarallanpoe,"now called to Augustus. He replied, although very feebly, so that"
edgarallanpoe,I could not distinguish what he said. I then spoke to Peters and to
edgarallanpoe,"Parker, neither of whom returned any answer."
edgarallanpoe,"Shortly after this period I fell into a state of partial insensibility,"
edgarallanpoe,during which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination; such as
edgarallanpoe,"green trees, waving meadows of ripe grain, processions of dancing girls,"
edgarallanpoe,"troops of cavalry, and other phantasies. I now remember that, in all"
edgarallanpoe,"which passed before my mind’s eye, motion was a predominant idea. Thus,"
edgarallanpoe,"I never fancied any stationary object, such as a house, a mountain, or"
edgarallanpoe,"any thing of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds, balloons,"
edgarallanpoe,"people on horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar moving"
edgarallanpoe,"objects, presented themselves in endless succession. When I recovered"
edgarallanpoe,"from this state, the sun was, as near as I could guess, an hour high."
edgarallanpoe,I had the greatest difficulty in bringing to recollection the various
edgarallanpoe,"circumstances connected with my situation, and for some time remained"
edgarallanpoe,"firmly convinced that I was still in the hold of the brig, near the box,"
edgarallanpoe,and that the body of Parker was that of Tiger.
edgarallanpoe,"When I at length completely came to my senses, I found that the wind"
edgarallanpoe,"blew no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was comparatively"
edgarallanpoe,calm; so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships. My left
edgarallanpoe,"arm had broken loose from its lashings, and was much cut about the"
edgarallanpoe,"elbow; my right was entirely benumbed, and the hand and wrist swollen"
edgarallanpoe,"prodigiously by the pressure of the rope, which had worked from the"
edgarallanpoe,shoulder downward. I was also in great pain from another rope which
edgarallanpoe,"went about my waist, and had been drawn to an insufferable degree of"
edgarallanpoe,"tightness. Looking round upon my companions, I saw that Peters still"
edgarallanpoe,"lived, although a thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as"
edgarallanpoe,"to give him the appearance of being cut nearly in two; as I stirred, he"
edgarallanpoe,"made a feeble motion to me with his hand, pointing to the rope. Augustus"
edgarallanpoe,"gave no indication of life whatever, and was bent nearly double across a"
edgarallanpoe,"splinter of the windlass. Parker spoke to me when he saw me moving,"
edgarallanpoe,and asked me if I had not sufficient strength to release him from his
edgarallanpoe,"situation, saying that if I would summon up what spirits I could, and"
edgarallanpoe,"contrive to untie him, we might yet save our lives; but that otherwise"
edgarallanpoe,"we must all perish. I told him to take courage, and I would endeavor to"
edgarallanpoe,"free him. Feeling in my pantaloons’ pocket, I got hold of my penknife,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, after several ineffectual attempts, at length succeeded in opening"
edgarallanpoe,"it. I then, with my left hand, managed to free my right from its"
edgarallanpoe,"fastenings, and afterward cut the other ropes which held me. Upon"
edgarallanpoe,"attempting, however, to move from my position, I found that my legs"
edgarallanpoe,"failed me altogether, and that I could not get up; neither could I"
edgarallanpoe,"move my right arm in any direction. Upon mentioning this to Parker, he"
edgarallanpoe,"advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the windlass"
edgarallanpoe,"with my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to circulate. Doing"
edgarallanpoe,"this, the numbness presently began to die away so that I could move"
edgarallanpoe,"first one of my legs, and then the other, and, shortly afterward I"
edgarallanpoe,regained the partial use of my right arm. I now crawled with great
edgarallanpoe,"caution toward Parker, without getting on my legs, and soon cut loose"
edgarallanpoe,"all the lashings about him, when, after a short delay, he also recovered"
edgarallanpoe,the partial use of his limbs. We now lost no time in getting loose the
edgarallanpoe,rope from Peters. It had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his
edgarallanpoe,"woollen pantaloons, and through two shirts, and made its way into his"
edgarallanpoe,"groin, from which the blood flowed out copiously as we removed the"
edgarallanpoe,"cordage. No sooner had we removed it, however, than he spoke, and seemed"
edgarallanpoe,to experience instant relief--being able to move with much greater ease
edgarallanpoe,than either Parker or myself--this was no doubt owing to the discharge
edgarallanpoe,of blood.
edgarallanpoe,"We had little hopes that Augustus would recover, as he evinced no signs"
edgarallanpoe,"of life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he had merely"
edgarallanpoe,"swooned from the loss of blood, the bandages we had placed around his"
edgarallanpoe,wounded arm having been torn off by the water; none of the ropes which
edgarallanpoe,held him to the windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his
edgarallanpoe,"death. Having relieved him from the fastenings, and got him clear of"
edgarallanpoe,"the broken wood about the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to"
edgarallanpoe,"windward, with his head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of"
edgarallanpoe,us busied ourselves in chafing his limbs. In about half an hour he came
edgarallanpoe,"to himself, although it was not until the next morning that he gave"
edgarallanpoe,"signs of recognizing any of us, or had sufficient strength to speak. By"
edgarallanpoe,"the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was quite dark, and it"
edgarallanpoe,"began to cloud up, so that we were again in the greatest agony lest it"
edgarallanpoe,"should come on to blow hard, in which event nothing could have saved us"
edgarallanpoe,"from perishing, exhausted as we were. By good fortune it continued very"
edgarallanpoe,"moderate during the night, the sea subsiding every minute, which gave"
edgarallanpoe,us great hopes of ultimate preservation. A gentle breeze still blew
edgarallanpoe,"from the N. W., but the weather was not at all cold. Augustus was lashed"
edgarallanpoe,carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from slipping
edgarallanpoe,"overboard with the rolls of the vessel, as he was still too weak to"
edgarallanpoe,hold on at all. For ourselves there was no such necessity. We sat close
edgarallanpoe,"together, supporting each other with the aid of the broken ropes"
edgarallanpoe,"about the windlass, and devising methods of escape from our frightful"
edgarallanpoe,situation. We derived much comfort from taking off our clothes and
edgarallanpoe,"wringing the water from them. When we put them on after this, they felt"
edgarallanpoe,"remarkably warm and pleasant, and served to invigorate us in no little"
edgarallanpoe,"degree. We helped Augustus off with his, and wrung them for him, when he"
edgarallanpoe,experienced the same comfort.
edgarallanpoe,"Our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and when we"
edgarallanpoe,"looked forward to the means of relief in this respect, our hearts sunk"
edgarallanpoe,"within us, and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the"
edgarallanpoe,"less dreadful perils of the sea. We endeavoured, however, to console"
edgarallanpoe,ourselves with the hope of being speedily picked up by some vessel
edgarallanpoe,and encouraged each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might
edgarallanpoe,happen.
edgarallanpoe,"The morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather still"
edgarallanpoe,"continued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light breeze from"
edgarallanpoe,"the N. W. The sea was now quite smooth, and as, from some cause which we"
edgarallanpoe,"could not determine, the brig did not lie so much along as she had done"
edgarallanpoe,"before, the deck was comparatively dry, and we could move about with"
edgarallanpoe,freedom. We had now been better than three entire days and nights
edgarallanpoe,"without either food or drink, and it became absolutely necessary that we"
edgarallanpoe,should make an attempt to get up something from below. As the brig was
edgarallanpoe,"completely full of water, we went to this work despondently, and with"
edgarallanpoe,but little expectation of being able to obtain anything. We made a kind
edgarallanpoe,of drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of the
edgarallanpoe,"companion-hatch into two pieces of wood. Tying these across each other,"
edgarallanpoe,"and fastening them to the end of a rope, we threw them into the cabin,"
edgarallanpoe,"and dragged them to and fro, in the faint hope of being thus able to"
edgarallanpoe,"entangle some article which might be of use to us for food, or which"
edgarallanpoe,might at least render us assistance in getting it. We spent the greater
edgarallanpoe,"part of the morning in this labour without effect, fishing up nothing"
edgarallanpoe,"more than a few bedclothes, which were readily caught by the nails."
edgarallanpoe,"Indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater success was"
edgarallanpoe,hardly to be anticipated.
edgarallanpoe,"We now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"brink of despair, when Peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to"
edgarallanpoe,"his body, and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving"
edgarallanpoe,into the cabin. This proposition we hailed with all the delight which
edgarallanpoe,reviving hope could inspire. He proceeded immediately to strip off his
edgarallanpoe,clothes with the exception of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was
edgarallanpoe,"then carefully fastened around his middle, being brought up over"
edgarallanpoe,his shoulders in such a manner that there was no possibility of its
edgarallanpoe,"slipping. The undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger; for,"
edgarallanpoe,"as we could hardly expect to find much, if any, provision in the cabin"
edgarallanpoe,"itself, it was necessary that the diver, after letting himself down,"
edgarallanpoe,"should make a turn to the right, and proceed under water a distance of"
edgarallanpoe,"ten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the storeroom, and return,"
edgarallanpoe,without drawing breath.
edgarallanpoe,"Everything being ready, Peters now descended in the cabin, going down"
edgarallanpoe,the companion-ladder until the water reached his chin. He then plunged
edgarallanpoe,"in, head first, turning to the right as he plunged, and endeavouring to"
edgarallanpoe,"make his way to the storeroom. In this first attempt, however, he was"
edgarallanpoe,altogether unsuccessful. In less than half a minute after his going down
edgarallanpoe,we felt the rope jerked violently (the signal we had agreed upon when
edgarallanpoe,"he desired to be drawn up). We accordingly drew him up instantly, but so"
edgarallanpoe,incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder. He had brought
edgarallanpoe,"nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more than a very"
edgarallanpoe,"little way into the passage, owing to the constant exertions he found it"
edgarallanpoe,necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up against the
edgarallanpoe,"deck. Upon getting out he was very much exhausted, and had to rest full"
edgarallanpoe,fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend.
edgarallanpoe,The second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained so long
edgarallanpoe,"under water without giving the signal, that, becoming alarmed for his"
edgarallanpoe,"safety, we drew him out without it, and found that he was almost at the"
edgarallanpoe,"last gasp, having, as he said, repeatedly jerked at the rope without"
edgarallanpoe,our feeling it. This was probably owing to a portion of it having become
edgarallanpoe,entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder. This balustrade
edgarallanpoe,"was, indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if"
edgarallanpoe,"possible, before proceeding with our design. As we had no means of"
edgarallanpoe,"getting it away except by main force, we all descended into the water"
edgarallanpoe,"as far as we could on the ladder, and giving a pull against it with our"
edgarallanpoe,"united strength, succeeded in breaking it down."
edgarallanpoe,"The third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first, and it"
edgarallanpoe,now became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without the
edgarallanpoe,"aid of some weight with which the diver might steady himself, and keep"
edgarallanpoe,to the floor of the cabin while making his search. For a long time we
edgarallanpoe,looked about in vain for something which might answer this purpose; but
edgarallanpoe,"at length, to our great joy, we discovered one of the weather-forechains"
edgarallanpoe,so loose that we had not the least difficulty in wrenching it off.
edgarallanpoe,"Having fastened this securely to one of his ankles, Peters now made his"
edgarallanpoe,"fourth descent into the cabin, and this time succeeded in making his way"
edgarallanpoe,"to the door of the steward’s room. To his inexpressible grief, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"he found it locked, and was obliged to return without effecting an"
edgarallanpoe,"entrance, as, with the greatest exertion, he could remain under water"
edgarallanpoe,"not more, at the utmost extent, than a single minute. Our affairs now"
edgarallanpoe,"looked gloomy indeed, and neither Augustus nor myself could refrain from"
edgarallanpoe,"bursting into tears, as we thought of the host of difficulties which"
edgarallanpoe,"encompassed us, and the slight probability which existed of our finally"
edgarallanpoe,making an escape. But this weakness was not of long duration. Throwing
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves on our knees to God, we implored His aid in the many dangers"
edgarallanpoe,which beset us; and arose with renewed hope and vigor to think what
edgarallanpoe,could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our deliverance.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 10
edgarallanpoe,SHORTLY afterward an incident occurred which I am induced to look upon
edgarallanpoe,"as more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete with the"
edgarallanpoe,"extremes first of delight and then of horror, than even any of the"
edgarallanpoe,"thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years, crowded"
edgarallanpoe,"with events of the most startling and, in many cases, of the most"
edgarallanpoe,unconceived and unconceivable character. We were lying on the deck near
edgarallanpoe,"the companion-way, and debating the possibility of yet making our way"
edgarallanpoe,"into the storeroom, when, looking toward Augustus, who lay fronting"
edgarallanpoe,"myself, I perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale, and that"
edgarallanpoe,his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner.
edgarallanpoe,"Greatly alarmed, I spoke to him, but he made me no reply, and I was"
edgarallanpoe,"beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill, when I took notice"
edgarallanpoe,"of his eyes, which were glaring apparently at some object behind me. I"
edgarallanpoe,"turned my head, and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which thrilled"
edgarallanpoe,"through every particle of my frame, when I perceived a large brig"
edgarallanpoe,"bearing down upon us, and not more than a couple of miles off. I sprung"
edgarallanpoe,to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart;
edgarallanpoe,"and, stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel, stood in"
edgarallanpoe,"this manner, motionless, and unable to articulate a syllable. Peters"
edgarallanpoe,"and Parker were equally affected, although in different ways. The former"
edgarallanpoe,"danced about the deck like a madman, uttering the most extravagant"
edgarallanpoe,"rhodomontades, intermingled with howls and imprecations, while the"
edgarallanpoe,"latter burst into tears, and continued for many minutes weeping like a"
edgarallanpoe,child.
edgarallanpoe,"The vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a Dutch build,"
edgarallanpoe,"and painted black, with a tawdry gilt figure-head. She had evidently"
edgarallanpoe,"seen a good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed, had suffered"
edgarallanpoe,much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves; for her
edgarallanpoe,"foretopmast was gone, and some of her starboard bulwarks. When we first"
edgarallanpoe,"saw her, she was, as I have already said, about two miles off and to"
edgarallanpoe,"windward, bearing down upon us. The breeze was very gentle, and what"
edgarallanpoe,"astonished us chiefly was, that she had no other sails set than her"
edgarallanpoe,"foremast and mainsail, with a flying jib--of course she came down but"
edgarallanpoe,"slowly, and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy. The awkward"
edgarallanpoe,"manner in which she steered, too, was remarked by all of us, even"
edgarallanpoe,"excited as we were. She yawed about so considerably, that once or twice"
edgarallanpoe,"we thought it impossible she could see us, or imagined that, having seen"
edgarallanpoe,"us, and discovered no person on board, she was about to tack and make"
edgarallanpoe,off in another direction. Upon each of these occasions we screamed and
edgarallanpoe,"shouted at the top of our voices, when the stranger would appear to"
edgarallanpoe,"change for a moment her intention, and again hold on toward us--this"
edgarallanpoe,"singular conduct being repeated two or three times, so that at last we"
edgarallanpoe,could think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing
edgarallanpoe,the helmsman to be in liquor.
edgarallanpoe,No person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a
edgarallanpoe,"quarter of a mile of us. We then saw three seamen, whom by their dress"
edgarallanpoe,we took to be Hollanders. Two of these were lying on some old sails near
edgarallanpoe,"the forecastle, and the third, who appeared to be looking at us with"
edgarallanpoe,"great curiosity, was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit."
edgarallanpoe,"This last was a stout and tall man, with a very dark skin. He seemed"
edgarallanpoe,"by his manner to be encouraging us to have patience, nodding to us in"
edgarallanpoe,"a cheerful although rather odd way, and smiling constantly, so as to"
edgarallanpoe,display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth. As his vessel drew
edgarallanpoe,"nearer, we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into"
edgarallanpoe,"the water; but of this he took little or no notice, continuing his"
edgarallanpoe,odd smiles and gesticulations. I relate these things and circumstances
edgarallanpoe,"minutely, and I relate them, it must be understood, precisely as they"
edgarallanpoe,_appeared _to us.
edgarallanpoe,"The brig came on slowly, and now more steadily than before, and--I"
edgarallanpoe,cannot speak calmly of this event--our hearts leaped up wildly within
edgarallanpoe,"us, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to"
edgarallanpoe,"God for the complete, unexpected, and glorious deliverance that was so"
edgarallanpoe,"palpably at hand. Of a sudden, and all at once, there came wafted over"
edgarallanpoe,the ocean from the strange vessel (which was now close upon us) a
edgarallanpoe,"smell, a stench, such as the whole world has no name for--no conception"
edgarallanpoe,"of--hellish--utterly suffocating--insufferable, inconceivable. I gasped"
edgarallanpoe,"for breath, and turning to my companions, perceived that they were paler"
edgarallanpoe,than marble. But we had now no time left for question or surmise--the
edgarallanpoe,"brig was within fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her intention to"
edgarallanpoe,"run under our counter, that we might board her without putting out a"
edgarallanpoe,"boat. We rushed aft, when, suddenly, a wide yaw threw her off full five"
edgarallanpoe,"or six points from the course she had been running, and, as she passed"
edgarallanpoe,"under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet, we had a full view"
edgarallanpoe,of her decks. Shall I ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle?
edgarallanpoe,"Twenty-five or thirty human bodies, among whom were several females, lay"
edgarallanpoe,scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last and most
edgarallanpoe,loathsome state of putrefaction. We plainly saw that not a soul lived in
edgarallanpoe,that fated vessel! Yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help!
edgarallanpoe,"Yes, long and loudly did we beg, in the agony of the moment, that those"
edgarallanpoe,"silent and disgusting images would stay for us, would not abandon us to"
edgarallanpoe,"become like them, would receive us among their goodly company! We were"
edgarallanpoe,raving with horror and despair--thoroughly mad through the anguish of
edgarallanpoe,our grievous disappointment.
edgarallanpoe,"As our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to by"
edgarallanpoe,"something, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely resembling"
edgarallanpoe,the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled
edgarallanpoe,and deceived. At this instant another sudden yaw brought the region of
edgarallanpoe,"the forecastle for a moment into view, and we beheld at once the origin"
edgarallanpoe,"of the sound. We saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark,"
edgarallanpoe,"and still nodding his head to and fro, but his face was now turned from"
edgarallanpoe,"us so that we could not behold it. His arms were extended over the rail,"
edgarallanpoe,and the palms of his hands fell outward. His knees were lodged upon
edgarallanpoe,"a stout rope, tightly stretched, and reaching from the heel of the"
edgarallanpoe,"bowsprit to a cathead. On his back, from which a portion of the shirt"
edgarallanpoe,"had been torn, leaving it bare, there sat a huge sea-gull, busily"
edgarallanpoe,"gorging itself with the horrible flesh, its bill and talons deep buried,"
edgarallanpoe,and its white plumage spattered all over with blood. As the brig moved
edgarallanpoe,"farther round so as to bring us close in view, the bird, with much"
edgarallanpoe,"apparent difficulty, drew out its crimsoned head, and, after eyeing us"
edgarallanpoe,"for a moment as if stupefied, arose lazily from the body upon which it"
edgarallanpoe,"had been feasting, and, flying directly above our deck, hovered there"
edgarallanpoe,a while with a portion of clotted and liver-like substance in its beak.
edgarallanpoe,The horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash immediately
edgarallanpoe,"at the feet of Parker. May God forgive me, but now, for the first time,"
edgarallanpoe,"there flashed through my mind a thought, a thought which I will not"
edgarallanpoe,"mention, and I felt myself making a step toward the ensanguined spot."
edgarallanpoe,"I looked upward, and the eyes of Augustus met my own with a degree of"
edgarallanpoe,intense and eager meaning which immediately brought me to my senses. I
edgarallanpoe,"sprang forward quickly, and, with a deep shudder, threw the frightful"
edgarallanpoe,thing into the sea.
edgarallanpoe,"The body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the rope,"
edgarallanpoe,had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous
edgarallanpoe,"bird, and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the"
edgarallanpoe,"belief of its being alive. As the gull relieved it of its weight,"
edgarallanpoe,"it swung round and fell partially over, so that the face was fully"
edgarallanpoe,"discovered. Never, surely, was any object so terribly full of awe! The"
edgarallanpoe,"eyes were gone, and the whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth"
edgarallanpoe,"utterly naked. This, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to"
edgarallanpoe,"hope! this the--but I forbear. The brig, as I have already told, passed"
edgarallanpoe,"under our stern, and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward. With"
edgarallanpoe,her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance
edgarallanpoe,"and joy. Deliberately as she went by, we might possibly have found means"
edgarallanpoe,"of boarding her, had not our sudden disappointment and the appalling"
edgarallanpoe,nature of the discovery which accompanied it laid entirely prostrate
edgarallanpoe,"every active faculty of mind and body. We had seen and felt, but"
edgarallanpoe,"we could neither think nor act, until, alas! too late. How much our"
edgarallanpoe,intellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the
edgarallanpoe,"fact, that when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive"
edgarallanpoe,"no more than the half of her hull, the proposition was seriously"
edgarallanpoe,entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming!
edgarallanpoe,"I have, since this period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the"
edgarallanpoe,hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger. Her build
edgarallanpoe,"and general appearance, as I have before stated, led us to the belief"
edgarallanpoe,"that she was a Dutch trader, and the dresses of the crew also sustained"
edgarallanpoe,"this opinion. We might have easily seen the name upon her stern, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed, taken other observations, which would have guided us in making"
edgarallanpoe,out her character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us
edgarallanpoe,to every thing of that nature. From the saffron-like hue of such of the
edgarallanpoe,"corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the whole of her"
edgarallanpoe,"company had perished by the yellow fever, or some other virulent disease"
edgarallanpoe,of the same fearful kind. If such were the case (and I know not what
edgarallanpoe,"else to imagine), death, to judge from the positions of the bodies, must"
edgarallanpoe,"have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a"
edgarallanpoe,way totally distinct from that which generally characterizes even
edgarallanpoe,the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are acquainted. It is
edgarallanpoe,"possible, indeed, that poison, accidentally introduced into some of"
edgarallanpoe,"their sea-stores, may have brought about the disaster, or that the"
edgarallanpoe,"eating of some unknown venomous species of fish, or other marine animal,"
edgarallanpoe,"or oceanic bird, might have induced it--but it is utterly useless to"
edgarallanpoe,"form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no doubt, remain for"
edgarallanpoe,"ever involved, in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery."
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 11
edgarallanpoe,"WE spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy,"
edgarallanpoe,"gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness, hiding her from"
edgarallanpoe,"our sight, recalled us in some measure to our senses. The pangs"
edgarallanpoe,"of hunger and thirst then returned, absorbing all other cares and"
edgarallanpoe,"considerations. Nothing, however, could be done until the morning,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, securing ourselves as well as possible, we endeavoured to snatch"
edgarallanpoe,"a little repose. In this I succeeded beyond my expectations, sleeping"
edgarallanpoe,"until my companions, who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at"
edgarallanpoe,daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull.
edgarallanpoe,"It was now a dead calm, with the sea as smooth as I have ever known"
edgarallanpoe,"it,--the weather warm and pleasant. The brig was out of sight. We"
edgarallanpoe,"commenced our operations by wrenching off, with some trouble, another of"
edgarallanpoe,"the forechains; and having fastened both to Peters’ feet, he again made"
edgarallanpoe,"an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom, thinking it possible"
edgarallanpoe,"that he might be able to force it open, provided he could get at it"
edgarallanpoe,"in sufficient time; and this he hoped to do, as the hulk lay much more"
edgarallanpoe,steadily than before.
edgarallanpoe,"He succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening one of"
edgarallanpoe,"the chains from his ankle, he made every exertion to force the passage"
edgarallanpoe,"with it, but in vain, the framework of the room being far stronger than"
edgarallanpoe,"was anticipated. He was quite exhausted with his long stay under water,"
edgarallanpoe,and it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take
edgarallanpoe,"his place. For this service Parker immediately volunteered; but, after"
edgarallanpoe,"making three ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even succeed"
edgarallanpoe,in getting near the door. The condition of Augustus’s wounded arm
edgarallanpoe,"rendered it useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be"
edgarallanpoe,"unable to force the room open should he reach it, and it accordingly now"
edgarallanpoe,devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance.
edgarallanpoe,"Peters had left one of the chains in the passage, and I found, upon"
edgarallanpoe,"plunging in, that I had not sufficient balance to keep me firmly down."
edgarallanpoe,"I determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my first effort, than"
edgarallanpoe,merely to recover the other chain. In groping along the floor of the
edgarallanpoe,"passage for this, I felt a hard substance, which I immediately grasped,"
edgarallanpoe,"not having time to ascertain what it was, but returning and ascending"
edgarallanpoe,"instantly to the surface. The prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy"
edgarallanpoe,may be conceived when I say that it was found to be full of port
edgarallanpoe,"wine. Giving thanks to God for this timely and cheering assistance, we"
edgarallanpoe,"immediately drew the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate"
edgarallanpoe,"sup, felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength,"
edgarallanpoe,and spirits with which it inspired us. We then carefully recorked the
edgarallanpoe,"bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a manner that"
edgarallanpoe,there was no possibility of its getting broken.
edgarallanpoe,"Having rested a while after this fortunate discovery, I again descended,"
edgarallanpoe,"and now recovered the chain, with which I instantly came up. I then"
edgarallanpoe,"fastened it on and went down for the third time, when I became fully"
edgarallanpoe,"satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that situation, would enable"
edgarallanpoe,me to force open the door of the storeroom. I therefore returned in
edgarallanpoe,despair.
edgarallanpoe,"There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope, and I could perceive"
edgarallanpoe,in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their
edgarallanpoe,minds to perish. The wine had evidently produced in them a species
edgarallanpoe,"of delirium, which, perhaps, I had been prevented from feeling by the"
edgarallanpoe,"immersion I had undergone since drinking it. They talked incoherently,"
edgarallanpoe,"and about matters unconnected with our condition, Peters repeatedly"
edgarallanpoe,"asking me questions about Nantucket. Augustus, too, I remember,"
edgarallanpoe,"approached me with a serious air, and requested me to lend him a"
edgarallanpoe,"pocket-comb, as his hair was full of fish-scales, and he wished to get"
edgarallanpoe,"them out before going on shore. Parker appeared somewhat less affected,"
edgarallanpoe,"and urged me to dive at random into the cabin, and bring up any article"
edgarallanpoe,"which might come to hand. To this I consented, and, in the first"
edgarallanpoe,"attempt, after staying under a full minute, brought up a small leather"
edgarallanpoe,trunk belonging to Captain Barnard. This was immediately opened in the
edgarallanpoe,faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink. We found
edgarallanpoe,"nothing, however, except a box of razors and two linen shirts. I now"
edgarallanpoe,"went down again, and returned without any success. As my head came"
edgarallanpoe,"above water I heard a crash on deck, and, upon getting up, saw that my"
edgarallanpoe,companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the
edgarallanpoe,"remainder of the wine, having let the bottle fall in the endeavour"
edgarallanpoe,to replace it before I saw them. I remonstrated with them on the
edgarallanpoe,"heartlessness of their conduct, when Augustus burst into tears. The"
edgarallanpoe,"other two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but I hope"
edgarallanpoe,never again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of
edgarallanpoe,"countenance was absolutely frightful. Indeed, it was apparent that the"
edgarallanpoe,"stimulus, in the empty state of their stomachs, had taken instant and"
edgarallanpoe,"violent effect, and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated. With"
edgarallanpoe,"great difficulty I prevailed upon them to lie down, when they fell very"
edgarallanpoe,"soon into a heavy slumber, accompanied with loud stertorous breathing."
edgarallanpoe,"I now found myself, as it were, alone in the brig, and my reflections,"
edgarallanpoe,"to be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy nature. No prospect"
edgarallanpoe,"offered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine, or, at the"
edgarallanpoe,"best, by being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up,"
edgarallanpoe,for in our present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living
edgarallanpoe,through another.
edgarallanpoe,"The gnawing hunger which I now experienced was nearly insupportable, and"
edgarallanpoe,I felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease
edgarallanpoe,"it. With my knife I cut off a small portion of the leather trunk, and"
edgarallanpoe,"endeavoured to eat it, but found it utterly impossible to swallow a"
edgarallanpoe,"single morsel, although I fancied that some little alleviation of my"
edgarallanpoe,suffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting
edgarallanpoe,"them out. Toward night my companions awoke, one by one, each in an"
edgarallanpoe,"indescribable state of weakness and horror, brought on by the wine,"
edgarallanpoe,"whose fumes had now evaporated. They shook as if with a violent ague,"
edgarallanpoe,and uttered the most lamentable cries for water. Their condition
edgarallanpoe,"affected me in the most lively degree, at the same time causing me to"
edgarallanpoe,rejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented
edgarallanpoe,"me from indulging in the wine, and consequently from sharing their"
edgarallanpoe,"melancholy and most distressing sensations. Their conduct, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"gave me great uneasiness and alarm; for it was evident that, unless"
edgarallanpoe,"some favourable change took place, they could afford me no assistance in"
edgarallanpoe,providing for our common safety. I had not yet abandoned all idea of being
edgarallanpoe,able to get up something from below; but the attempt could not possibly
edgarallanpoe,be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of himself to
edgarallanpoe,aid me by holding the end of the rope while I went down. Parker appeared
edgarallanpoe,"to be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others, and I"
edgarallanpoe,"endeavoured, by every means in my power, to rouse him. Thinking that a"
edgarallanpoe,"plunge in the sea-water might have a beneficial effect, I contrived to"
edgarallanpoe,"fasten the end of a rope around his body, and then, leading him to the"
edgarallanpoe,"companion-way (he remaining quite passive all the while), pushed him in,"
edgarallanpoe,and immediately drew him out. I had good reason to congratulate myself
edgarallanpoe,upon having made this experiment; for he appeared much revived and
edgarallanpoe,"invigorated, and, upon getting out, asked me, in a rational manner, why"
edgarallanpoe,"I had so served him. Having explained my object, he expressed himself"
edgarallanpoe,"indebted to me, and said that he felt greatly better from the immersion,"
edgarallanpoe,afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation. We then resolved to
edgarallanpoe,"treat Augustus and Peters in the same way, which we immediately did,"
edgarallanpoe,when they both experienced much benefit from the shock. This idea of
edgarallanpoe,sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some medical
edgarallanpoe,work the good effect of the shower-bath in a case where the patient was
edgarallanpoe,suffering from _mania a potu_.
edgarallanpoe,Finding that I could now trust my companions to hold the end of the
edgarallanpoe,"rope, I again made three or four plunges into the cabin, although it was"
edgarallanpoe,"now quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered"
edgarallanpoe,the hulk somewhat unsteady. In the course of these attempts I succeeded
edgarallanpoe,"in bringing up two case-knives, a three-gallon jug, empty, and a"
edgarallanpoe,"blanket, but nothing which could serve us for food. I continued my"
edgarallanpoe,"efforts, after getting these articles, until I was completely exhausted,"
edgarallanpoe,but brought up nothing else. During the night Parker and Peters occupied
edgarallanpoe,"themselves by turns in the same manner; but nothing coming to hand, we"
edgarallanpoe,"now gave up this attempt in despair, concluding that we were exhausting"
edgarallanpoe,ourselves in vain.
edgarallanpoe,We passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense
edgarallanpoe,mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined. The morning of
edgarallanpoe,"the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked eagerly around the horizon"
edgarallanpoe,"for relief, but to no purpose. The sea was still smooth, with only a"
edgarallanpoe,"long swell from the northward, as on yesterday. This was the sixth day"
edgarallanpoe,"since we had tasted either food or drink, with the exception of the"
edgarallanpoe,"bottle of port wine, and it was clear that we could hold out but a very"
edgarallanpoe,little while longer unless something could be obtained. I never saw
edgarallanpoe,"before, nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as"
edgarallanpoe,Peters and Augustus. Had I met them on shore in their present condition
edgarallanpoe,I should not have had the slightest suspicion that I had ever beheld
edgarallanpoe,"them. Their countenances were totally changed in character, so that I"
edgarallanpoe,could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with
edgarallanpoe,"whom I had been in company but a few days before. Parker, although sadly"
edgarallanpoe,"reduced, and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom,"
edgarallanpoe,"was not so far gone as the other two. He suffered with great patience,"
edgarallanpoe,"making no complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every"
edgarallanpoe,"manner he could devise. For myself, although at the commencement of"
edgarallanpoe,"the voyage I had been in bad health, and was at all times of a delicate"
edgarallanpoe,"constitution, I suffered less than any of us, being much less reduced in"
edgarallanpoe,"frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree, while the"
edgarallanpoe,"rest were completely prostrated in intellect, and seemed to be"
edgarallanpoe,"brought to a species of second childhood, generally simpering in"
edgarallanpoe,"their expressions, with idiotic smiles, and uttering the most absurd"
edgarallanpoe,"platitudes. At intervals, however, they would appear to revive suddenly,"
edgarallanpoe,"as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition, when"
edgarallanpoe,"they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour, and"
edgarallanpoe,"speak, for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner altogether"
edgarallanpoe,"rational, although full of the most intense despair. It is possible,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of"
edgarallanpoe,"their own condition as I did of mine, and that I may have"
edgarallanpoe,unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as
edgarallanpoe,themselves--this is a matter which cannot be determined.
edgarallanpoe,"About noon Parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter,"
edgarallanpoe,and it was with the utmost difficulty I could restrain him from plunging
edgarallanpoe,into the sea with the view of swimming toward it. Peters and Augustus
edgarallanpoe,"took little notice of what he said, being apparently wrapped up in moody"
edgarallanpoe,"contemplation. Upon looking in the direction pointed out, I could not"
edgarallanpoe,"perceive the faintest appearance of the shore--indeed, I was too well"
edgarallanpoe,aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of that
edgarallanpoe,"nature. It was a long time, nevertheless, before I could convince Parker"
edgarallanpoe,"of his mistake. He then burst into a flood of tears, weeping like a"
edgarallanpoe,"child, with loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when becoming"
edgarallanpoe,"exhausted, he fell asleep."
edgarallanpoe,Peters and Augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow
edgarallanpoe,portions of the leather. I advised them to chew it and spit it out; but
edgarallanpoe,they were too excessively debilitated to be able to follow my advice. I
edgarallanpoe,"continued to chew pieces of it at intervals, and found some relief from"
edgarallanpoe,"so doing; my chief distress was for water, and I was only prevented from"
edgarallanpoe,taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences
edgarallanpoe,which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with
edgarallanpoe,ourselves.
edgarallanpoe,"The day wore on in this manner, when I suddenly discovered a sail to the"
edgarallanpoe,"eastward, and on our larboard bow. She appeared to be a large ship, and"
edgarallanpoe,"was coming nearly athwart us, being probably twelve or fifteen miles"
edgarallanpoe,"distant. None of my companions had as yet discovered her, and I forbore"
edgarallanpoe,"to tell them of her for the present, lest we might again be disappointed"
edgarallanpoe,"of relief. At length upon her getting nearer, I saw distinctly that she"
edgarallanpoe,"was heading immediately for us, with her light sails filled. I could now"
edgarallanpoe,"contain myself no longer, and pointed her out to my fellow-sufferers."
edgarallanpoe,"They immediately sprang to their feet, again indulging in the most"
edgarallanpoe,"extravagant demonstrations of joy, weeping, laughing in an idiotic"
edgarallanpoe,"manner, jumping, stamping upon the deck, tearing their hair, and praying"
edgarallanpoe,"and cursing by turns. I was so affected by their conduct, as well as"
edgarallanpoe,"by what I considered a sure prospect of deliverance, that I could not"
edgarallanpoe,"refrain from joining in with their madness, and gave way to the impulses"
edgarallanpoe,"of my gratitude and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck, clapping"
edgarallanpoe,"my hands, shouting, and other similar acts, until I was suddenly called"
edgarallanpoe,"to my recollection, and once more to the extreme human misery and"
edgarallanpoe,"despair, by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully"
edgarallanpoe,"presented toward us, and steering in a direction nearly opposite to that"
edgarallanpoe,in which I had at first perceived her.
edgarallanpoe,It was some time before I could induce my poor companions to believe
edgarallanpoe,that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place. They
edgarallanpoe,replied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that
edgarallanpoe,they were not to be deceived by such misrepresentations. The conduct of
edgarallanpoe,Augustus most sensibly affected me. In spite of all I could say or do to
edgarallanpoe,"the contrary, he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing"
edgarallanpoe,"us, and in making preparations to go on board of her. Some seaweed"
edgarallanpoe,"floating by the brig, he maintained that it was the ship’s boat, and"
edgarallanpoe,"endeavoured to throw himself upon it, howling and shrieking in the most"
edgarallanpoe,"heartrending manner, when I forcibly restrained him from thus casting"
edgarallanpoe,himself into the sea.
edgarallanpoe,"Having become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the ship"
edgarallanpoe,"until we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming hazy, with"
edgarallanpoe,"a light breeze springing up. As soon as she was entirely gone, Parker"
edgarallanpoe,turned suddenly toward me with an expression of countenance which made
edgarallanpoe,me shudder. There was about him an air of self-possession which I had
edgarallanpoe,"not noticed in him until now, and before he opened his lips my heart"
edgarallanpoe,"told me what he would say. He proposed, in a few words, that one of us"
edgarallanpoe,should die to preserve the existence of the others.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 12
edgarallanpoe,"I had for some time past, dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced"
edgarallanpoe,"to this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up my mind to"
edgarallanpoe,suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort
edgarallanpoe,to such a course. Nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the
edgarallanpoe,present intensity of hunger under which I laboured. The proposition had
edgarallanpoe,not been heard by either Peters or Augustus. I therefore took Parker
edgarallanpoe,aside; and mentally praying to God for power to dissuade him from the
edgarallanpoe,"horrible purpose he entertained, I expostulated with him for a long"
edgarallanpoe,"time, and in the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of"
edgarallanpoe,"every thing which he held sacred, and urging him by every species of"
edgarallanpoe,"argument which the extremity of the case suggested, to abandon the idea,"
edgarallanpoe,and not to mention it to either of the other two.
edgarallanpoe,He heard all I said without attempting to controvert any of my
edgarallanpoe,"arguments, and I had begun to hope that he would be prevailed upon to do"
edgarallanpoe,"as I desired. But when I had ceased speaking, he said that he knew very"
edgarallanpoe,"well all I had said was true, and that to resort to such a course was"
edgarallanpoe,the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man;
edgarallanpoe,but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained;
edgarallanpoe,"that it was unnecessary for all to perish, when, by the death of one,"
edgarallanpoe,"it was possible, and even probable, that the rest might be finally"
edgarallanpoe,preserved; adding that I might save myself the trouble of trying to turn
edgarallanpoe,"him from his purpose, his mind having been thoroughly made up on the"
edgarallanpoe,"subject even before the appearance of the ship, and that only her"
edgarallanpoe,heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention at an
edgarallanpoe,earlier period.
edgarallanpoe,"I now begged him, if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his"
edgarallanpoe,"design, at least to defer it for another day, when some vessel might"
edgarallanpoe,"come to our relief; again reiterating every argument I could devise, and"
edgarallanpoe,which I thought likely to have influence with one of his rough nature.
edgarallanpoe,"He said, in reply, that he had not spoken until the very last possible"
edgarallanpoe,"moment, that he could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind,"
edgarallanpoe,"and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be too late, as"
edgarallanpoe,regarded himself at least.
edgarallanpoe,Finding that he was not to be moved by anything I could say in a mild
edgarallanpoe,"tone, I now assumed a different demeanor, and told him that he must be"
edgarallanpoe,aware I had suffered less than any of us from our calamities; that my
edgarallanpoe,"health and strength, consequently, were at that moment far better than"
edgarallanpoe,"his own, or than that either of Peters or Augustus; in short, that I was"
edgarallanpoe,in a condition to have my own way by force if I found it necessary;
edgarallanpoe,and that if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his
edgarallanpoe,"bloody and cannibal designs, I would not hesitate to throw him into the"
edgarallanpoe,"sea. Upon this he immediately seized me by the throat, and drawing a"
edgarallanpoe,"knife, made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach;"
edgarallanpoe,an atrocity which his excessive debility alone prevented him from
edgarallanpoe,"accomplishing. In the meantime, being roused to a high pitch of anger, I"
edgarallanpoe,"forced him to the vessel’s side, with the full intention of throwing him"
edgarallanpoe,"overboard. He was saved from his fate, however, by the interference of"
edgarallanpoe,"Peters, who now approached and separated us, asking the cause of the"
edgarallanpoe,disturbance. This Parker told before I could find means in any manner to
edgarallanpoe,prevent him.
edgarallanpoe,The effect of his words was even more terrible than what I had
edgarallanpoe,"anticipated. Both Augustus and Peters, who, it seems, had long secretly"
edgarallanpoe,entertained the same fearful idea which Parker had been merely the
edgarallanpoe,"first to broach, joined with him in his design and insisted upon its"
edgarallanpoe,immediately being carried into effect. I had calculated that one at
edgarallanpoe,least of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient
edgarallanpoe,strength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute
edgarallanpoe,"so dreadful a purpose, and, with the aid of either one of them, I had no"
edgarallanpoe,fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment. Being disappointed in
edgarallanpoe,"this expectation, it became absolutely necessary that I should attend"
edgarallanpoe,"to my own safety, as a further resistance on my part might possibly be"
edgarallanpoe,considered by men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse
edgarallanpoe,for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that I knew would speedily be
edgarallanpoe,enacted.
edgarallanpoe,"I now told them I was willing to submit to the proposal, merely"
edgarallanpoe,"requesting a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which had"
edgarallanpoe,"gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when it was"
edgarallanpoe,possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight. After great
edgarallanpoe,"difficulty I obtained from them a promise to wait thus long; and, as I"
edgarallanpoe,"had anticipated (a breeze rapidly coming in), the fog lifted before the"
edgarallanpoe,"hour had expired, when, no vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to"
edgarallanpoe,draw lots.
edgarallanpoe,It is with extreme reluctance that I dwell upon the appalling scene
edgarallanpoe,"which ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no after events"
edgarallanpoe,"have been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory,"
edgarallanpoe,and whose stern recollection will embitter every future moment of my
edgarallanpoe,existence. Let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much
edgarallanpoe,haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit. The only
edgarallanpoe,"method we could devise for the terrific lottery, in which we were to"
edgarallanpoe,"take each a chance, was that of drawing straws. Small splinters of wood"
edgarallanpoe,"were made to answer our purpose, and it was agreed that I should be"
edgarallanpoe,"the holder. I retired to one end of the hulk, while my poor companions"
edgarallanpoe,silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned
edgarallanpoe,toward me. The bitterest anxiety which I endured at any period of this
edgarallanpoe,fearful drama was while I occupied myself in the arrangement of the
edgarallanpoe,lots. There are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he
edgarallanpoe,will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence;
edgarallanpoe,an interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by
edgarallanpoe,"which that existence may be held. But now that the silent, definite, and"
edgarallanpoe,stern nature of the business in which I was engaged (so different from
edgarallanpoe,the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors
edgarallanpoe,of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few chances I had of escaping
edgarallanpoe,the most appalling of deaths--a death for the most appalling of
edgarallanpoe,purposes--every particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up
edgarallanpoe,"departed like feathers before the wind, leaving me a helpless prey to"
edgarallanpoe,"the most abject and pitiable terror. I could not, at first, even summon"
edgarallanpoe,up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of
edgarallanpoe,"wood, my fingers absolutely refusing their office, and my knees knocking"
edgarallanpoe,violently against each other. My mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd
edgarallanpoe,projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation.
edgarallanpoe,"I thought of falling on my knees to my companions, and entreating them"
edgarallanpoe,"to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly rushing upon them, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"by putting one of them to death, of rendering the decision by lot"
edgarallanpoe,"useless--in short, of every thing but of going through with the matter"
edgarallanpoe,"I had in hand. At last, after wasting a long time in this imbecile"
edgarallanpoe,"conduct, I was recalled to my senses by the voice of Parker, who urged"
edgarallanpoe,me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring.
edgarallanpoe,Even then I could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the
edgarallanpoe,"spot, but thought over every species of finesse by which I could trick"
edgarallanpoe,"some one of my fellow-sufferers to draw the short straw, as it had been"
edgarallanpoe,agreed that whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was
edgarallanpoe,to die for the preservation of the rest. Before any one condemn me for
edgarallanpoe,"this apparent heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation precisely"
edgarallanpoe,similar to my own.
edgarallanpoe,"At length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost"
edgarallanpoe,"bursting from my bosom, I advanced to the region of the forecastle,"
edgarallanpoe,where my companions were awaiting me. I held out my hand with the
edgarallanpoe,"splinters, and Peters immediately drew. He was free--his, at least, was"
edgarallanpoe,not the shortest; and there was now another chance against my escape.
edgarallanpoe,"I summoned up all my strength, and passed the lots to Augustus. He also"
edgarallanpoe,"drew immediately, and he also was free; and now, whether I should live"
edgarallanpoe,"or die, the chances were no more than precisely even. At this moment"
edgarallanpoe,"all the fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom, and I felt toward"
edgarallanpoe,"my poor fellow-creature, Parker, the most intense, the most diabolical"
edgarallanpoe,"hatred. But the feeling did not last; and, at length, with a convulsive"
edgarallanpoe,"shudder and closed eyes, I held out the two remaining splinters toward"
edgarallanpoe,him. It was fully five minutes before he could summon resolution to
edgarallanpoe,"draw, during which period of heartrending suspense I never once opened"
edgarallanpoe,my eyes. Presently one of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand.
edgarallanpoe,"The decision was then over, yet I knew not whether it was for me or"
edgarallanpoe,"against me. No one spoke, and still I dared not satisfy myself by"
edgarallanpoe,looking at the splinter I held. Peters at length took me by the
edgarallanpoe,"hand, and I forced myself to look up, when I immediately saw by the"
edgarallanpoe,"countenance of Parker that I was safe, and that he it was who had been"
edgarallanpoe,"doomed to suffer. Gasping for breath, I fell senseless to the deck."
edgarallanpoe,I recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the
edgarallanpoe,tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in
edgarallanpoe,"bringing it about. He made no resistance whatever, and was stabbed in"
edgarallanpoe,"the back by Peters, when he fell instantly dead. I must not dwell"
edgarallanpoe,upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued. Such things may be
edgarallanpoe,"imagined, but words have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite"
edgarallanpoe,"horror of their reality. Let it suffice to say that, having in some"
edgarallanpoe,measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of
edgarallanpoe,"the victim, and having by common consent taken off the hands, feet,"
edgarallanpoe,"and head, throwing them together with the entrails, into the sea, we"
edgarallanpoe,"devoured the rest of the body, piecemeal, during the four ever memorable"
edgarallanpoe,"days of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth of the"
edgarallanpoe,month.
edgarallanpoe,"On the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen"
edgarallanpoe,"or twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet"
edgarallanpoe,which had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the gale.
edgarallanpoe,The quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon;
edgarallanpoe,but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and
edgarallanpoe,hope.
edgarallanpoe,On the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity. The
edgarallanpoe,"weather still remained warm and pleasant, with occasional fogs and light"
edgarallanpoe,"breezes, most usually from N. to W."
edgarallanpoe,"On the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together,"
edgarallanpoe,"gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed through"
edgarallanpoe,my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of
edgarallanpoe,"hope. I remembered that, when the foremast had been cut away, Peters,"
edgarallanpoe,"being in the windward chains, passed one of the axes into my hand,"
edgarallanpoe,"requesting me to put it, if possible, in a place of security, and that"
edgarallanpoe,a few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her
edgarallanpoe,I had taken this axe into the forecastle and laid it in one of the
edgarallanpoe,"larboard berths. I now thought it possible that, by getting at this"
edgarallanpoe,"axe, we might cut through the deck over the storeroom, and thus readily"
edgarallanpoe,supply ourselves with provisions.
edgarallanpoe,"When I communicated this object to my companions, they uttered a feeble"
edgarallanpoe,"shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle. The"
edgarallanpoe,difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the
edgarallanpoe,"cabin, the opening being much smaller, for it will be remembered that"
edgarallanpoe,the whole framework about the cabin companion-hatch had been carried
edgarallanpoe,"away, whereas the forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only about"
edgarallanpoe,"three feet square, had remained uninjured. I did not hesitate, however,"
edgarallanpoe,to attempt the descent; and a rope being fastened round my body as
edgarallanpoe,"before, I plunged boldly in, feet foremost, made my way quickly to the"
edgarallanpoe,"berth, and at the first attempt brought up the axe. It was hailed with"
edgarallanpoe,"the most ecstatic joy and triumph, and the ease with which it had been"
edgarallanpoe,obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate preservation.
edgarallanpoe,We now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled
edgarallanpoe,"hope, Peters and myself taking the axe by turns, Augustus’s wounded arm"
edgarallanpoe,not permitting him to aid us in any degree. As we were still so feeble
edgarallanpoe,"as to be scarcely able to stand unsupported, and could consequently work"
edgarallanpoe,"but a minute or two without resting, it soon became evident that many"
edgarallanpoe,"long hours would be necessary to accomplish our task--that is, to cut an"
edgarallanpoe,opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom.
edgarallanpoe,"This consideration, however, did not discourage us; and, working all"
edgarallanpoe,"night by the light of the moon, we succeeded in effecting our purpose by"
edgarallanpoe,daybreak on the morning of the twenty-third.
edgarallanpoe,"Peters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all arrangements"
edgarallanpoe,"as before, he descended, and soon returned bringing up with him a small"
edgarallanpoe,"jar, which, to our great joy, proved to be full of olives. Having"
edgarallanpoe,"shared these among us, and devoured them with the greatest avidity,"
edgarallanpoe,we proceeded to let him down again. This time he succeeded beyond our
edgarallanpoe,"utmost expectations, returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle"
edgarallanpoe,"of Madeira wine. Of the latter we each took a moderate sup, having"
edgarallanpoe,learned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too
edgarallanpoe,"freely. The ham, except about two pounds near the bone, was not in a"
edgarallanpoe,"condition to be eaten, having been entirely spoiled by the salt water."
edgarallanpoe,"The sound part was divided among us. Peters and Augustus, not being able"
edgarallanpoe,"to restrain their appetite, swallowed theirs upon the instant; but I was"
edgarallanpoe,"more cautious, and ate but a small portion of mine, dreading the thirst"
edgarallanpoe,"which I knew would ensue. We now rested a while from our labors, which"
edgarallanpoe,had been intolerably severe.
edgarallanpoe,"By noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again renewed"
edgarallanpoe,"our attempt at getting up provisions, Peters and myself going down"
edgarallanpoe,"alternately, and always with more or less success, until sundown. During"
edgarallanpoe,"this interval we had the good fortune to bring up, altogether, four"
edgarallanpoe,"more small jars of olives, another ham, a carboy containing nearly three"
edgarallanpoe,"gallons of excellent Cape Madeira wine, and, what gave us still more"
edgarallanpoe,"delight, a small tortoise of the Gallipago breed, several of which had"
edgarallanpoe,"been taken on board by Captain Barnard, as the _Grampus_ was leaving"
edgarallanpoe,"port, from the schooner _Mary Pitts_, just returned from a sealing"
edgarallanpoe,voyage in the Pacific.
edgarallanpoe,In a subsequent portion of this narrative I shall have frequent occasion
edgarallanpoe,"to mention this species of tortoise. It is found principally, as most"
edgarallanpoe,"of my readers may know, in the group of islands called the Gallipagos,"
edgarallanpoe,"which, indeed, derive their name from the animal--the Spanish word"
edgarallanpoe,Gallipago meaning a fresh-water terrapin. From the peculiarity of their
edgarallanpoe,shape and action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise.
edgarallanpoe,They are frequently found of an enormous size. I have myself seen
edgarallanpoe,"several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds,"
edgarallanpoe,although I do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them
edgarallanpoe,"weighing more than eight hundred. Their appearance is singular, and even"
edgarallanpoe,"disgusting. Their steps are very slow, measured, and heavy, their bodies"
edgarallanpoe,"being carried about a foot from the ground. Their neck is long, and"
edgarallanpoe,"exceedingly slender, from eighteen inches to two feet is a very common"
edgarallanpoe,"length, and I killed one, where the distance from the shoulder to the"
edgarallanpoe,extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten inches. The head
edgarallanpoe,has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent. They can exist without
edgarallanpoe,"food for an almost incredible length of time, instances having been"
edgarallanpoe,known where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain
edgarallanpoe,"two years without nourishment of any kind--being as fat, and, in every"
edgarallanpoe,"respect, in as good order at the expiration of the time as when they"
edgarallanpoe,were first put in. In one particular these extraordinary animals bear
edgarallanpoe,"a resemblance to the dromedary, or camel of the desert. In a bag at the"
edgarallanpoe,root of the neck they carry with them a constant supply of water. In
edgarallanpoe,"some instances, upon killing them after a full year’s deprivation of all"
edgarallanpoe,"nourishment, as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water"
edgarallanpoe,have been found in their bags. Their food is chiefly wild parsley and
edgarallanpoe,"celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and prickly pears, upon which latter"
edgarallanpoe,"vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a great quantity of it being usually"
edgarallanpoe,found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the animal itself is
edgarallanpoe,"discovered. They are excellent and highly nutritious food, and have,"
edgarallanpoe,"no doubt, been the means of preserving the lives of thousands of seamen"
edgarallanpoe,employed in the whale-fishery and other pursuits in the Pacific.
edgarallanpoe,The one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was
edgarallanpoe,"not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five or seventy pounds."
edgarallanpoe,"It was a female, and in excellent condition, being exceedingly fat, and"
edgarallanpoe,having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag. This
edgarallanpoe,"was indeed a treasure; and, falling on our knees with one accord, we"
edgarallanpoe,returned fervent thanks to God for so seasonable a relief.
edgarallanpoe,"We had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening, as"
edgarallanpoe,its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious. It was upon the
edgarallanpoe,"point of making its escape from Peter’s grasp, and slipping back into"
edgarallanpoe,"the water, when Augustus, throwing a rope with a slipknot around its"
edgarallanpoe,"throat, held it up in this manner until I jumped into the hole by the"
edgarallanpoe,"side of Peters, and assisted him in lifting it out."
edgarallanpoe,"The water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug; which, it will be"
edgarallanpoe,"remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin. Having done this,"
edgarallanpoe,"we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form, with the cork, a kind"
edgarallanpoe,"of glass, holding not quite half a gill. We then each drank one of these"
edgarallanpoe,"measures full, and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day"
edgarallanpoe,as long as it should hold out.
edgarallanpoe,"During the last two or three days, the weather having been dry and"
edgarallanpoe,"pleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well as our"
edgarallanpoe,"clothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed this night (that"
edgarallanpoe,"of the twenty-third) in comparative comfort, enjoying a tranquil"
edgarallanpoe,"repose, after having supped plentifully on olives and ham, with a"
edgarallanpoe,small allowance of the wine. Being afraid of losing some of our stores
edgarallanpoe,"overboard during the night, in the event of a breeze springing up, we"
edgarallanpoe,secured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the
edgarallanpoe,"windlass. Our tortoise, which we were anxious to preserve alive as long"
edgarallanpoe,"as we could, we threw on its back, and otherwise carefully fastened."
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 13
edgarallanpoe,JULY 24. This morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and
edgarallanpoe,strength. Notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still
edgarallanpoe,"placed, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a great distance"
edgarallanpoe,"from land, without more food than would last us for a fortnight even"
edgarallanpoe,"with great care, almost entirely without water, and floating about at"
edgarallanpoe,"the mercy of every wind and wave on the merest wreck in the world, still"
edgarallanpoe,the infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers from which we had so
edgarallanpoe,lately and so providentially been delivered caused us to regard what
edgarallanpoe,we now endured as but little more than an ordinary evil--so strictly
edgarallanpoe,comparative is either good or ill.
edgarallanpoe,At sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up
edgarallanpoe,"something from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on, with some"
edgarallanpoe,"lightning, we turn our attention to the catching of water by means of"
edgarallanpoe,the sheet we had used before for this purpose. We had no other means of
edgarallanpoe,collecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the
edgarallanpoe,"forechain-plates in the middle of it. The water, thus conducted to the"
edgarallanpoe,"centre, was drained through into our jug. We had nearly filled it in"
edgarallanpoe,"this manner, when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged"
edgarallanpoe,"us to desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that"
edgarallanpoe,"we could no longer keep our feet. We now went forward, and, lashing"
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before, awaited the"
edgarallanpoe,event with far more calmness than could have been anticipated or would
edgarallanpoe,have been imagined possible under the circumstances. At noon the wind
edgarallanpoe,"had freshened into a two-reef breeze, and by night into a stiff gale,"
edgarallanpoe,accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell. Experience having taught
edgarallanpoe,"us, however, the best method of arranging our lashings, we weathered"
edgarallanpoe,"this dreary night in tolerable security, although thoroughly drenched at"
edgarallanpoe,"almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary dread of being washed"
edgarallanpoe,"off. Fortunately, the weather was so warm as to render the water rather"
edgarallanpoe,grateful than otherwise.
edgarallanpoe,"July 25. This morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot breeze,"
edgarallanpoe,and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were able to
edgarallanpoe,"keep ourselves dry upon the deck. To our great grief, however, we found"
edgarallanpoe,"that two jars of our olives, as well as the whole of our ham, had been"
edgarallanpoe,"washed overboard, in spite of the careful manner in which they had been"
edgarallanpoe,"fastened. We determined not to kill the tortoise as yet, and contented"
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the olives, and"
edgarallanpoe,"a measure of water each, which latter we mixed half and half, with"
edgarallanpoe,"wine, finding great relief and strength from the mixture, without the"
edgarallanpoe,distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port. The
edgarallanpoe,sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at getting up
edgarallanpoe,"provision from the storeroom. Several articles, of no importance to us"
edgarallanpoe,"in our present situation, floated up through the opening during the day,"
edgarallanpoe,and were immediately washed overboard. We also now observed that the
edgarallanpoe,"hulk lay more along than ever, so that we could not stand an instant"
edgarallanpoe,without lashing ourselves. On this account we passed a gloomy and
edgarallanpoe,"uncomfortable day. At noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical, and"
edgarallanpoe,we had no doubt that we had been driven down by the long succession of
edgarallanpoe,northward and northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator.
edgarallanpoe,"Toward evening we saw several sharks, and were somewhat alarmed by the"
edgarallanpoe,audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us. At one
edgarallanpoe,"time, a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the water, the monster"
edgarallanpoe,"actually swam in upon us, floundering for some moments just over the"
edgarallanpoe,"companion-hatch, and striking Peters violently with his tail. A heavy"
edgarallanpoe,"sea at length hurled him overboard, much to our relief. In moderate"
edgarallanpoe,weather we might have easily captured him.
edgarallanpoe,"July 26. This morning, the wind having greatly abated, and the sea not"
edgarallanpoe,"being very rough, we determined to renew our exertions in the storeroom."
edgarallanpoe,"After a great deal of hard labor during the whole day, we found that"
edgarallanpoe,"nothing further was to be expected from this quarter, the partitions of"
edgarallanpoe,"the room having been stove during the night, and its contents swept into"
edgarallanpoe,"the hold. This discovery, as may be supposed, filled us with despair."
edgarallanpoe,"July 27. The sea nearly smooth, with a light wind, and still from the"
edgarallanpoe,"northward and westward. The sun coming out hotly in the afternoon,"
edgarallanpoe,we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes. Found great relief from
edgarallanpoe,"thirst, and much comfort otherwise, by bathing in the sea; in this,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, we were forced to use great caution, being afraid of sharks,"
edgarallanpoe,several of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day.
edgarallanpoe,July 28. Good weather still. The brig now began to lie along so
edgarallanpoe,alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up. Prepared
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves as well as we could for this emergency, lashing our tortoise,"
edgarallanpoe,"waterjug, and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to"
edgarallanpoe,"the windward, placing them outside the hull below the main-chains. The"
edgarallanpoe,"sea very smooth all day, with little or no wind."
edgarallanpoe,July 29. A continuance of the same weather. Augustus’s wounded arm began
edgarallanpoe,to evince symptoms of mortification. He complained of drowsiness and
edgarallanpoe,"excessive thirst, but no acute pain. Nothing could be done for his"
edgarallanpoe,relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the
edgarallanpoe,"olives, and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced. We did every"
edgarallanpoe,"thing in our power for his comfort, and trebled his allowance of water."
edgarallanpoe,"July 30. An excessively hot day, with no wind. An enormous shark kept"
edgarallanpoe,close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon. We made several
edgarallanpoe,unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose. Augustus much
edgarallanpoe,"worse, and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as"
edgarallanpoe,from the effect of his wounds. He constantly prayed to be relieved from
edgarallanpoe,"his sufferings, wishing for nothing but death. This evening we ate the"
edgarallanpoe,"last of our olives, and found the water in our jug so putrid that we"
edgarallanpoe,could not swallow it at all without the addition of wine. Determined to
edgarallanpoe,kill our tortoise in the morning.
edgarallanpoe,"July 31. After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to the"
edgarallanpoe,"position of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise."
edgarallanpoe,"He proved to be much smaller than we had supposed, although in good"
edgarallanpoe,"condition,--the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten"
edgarallanpoe,"pounds. With a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible,"
edgarallanpoe,"we cut it into fine pieces, and filled with them our three remaining"
edgarallanpoe,"olive jars and the wine-bottle (all of which had been kept), pouring in"
edgarallanpoe,afterward the vinegar from the olives. In this manner we put away about
edgarallanpoe,"three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it until we had"
edgarallanpoe,consumed the rest. We concluded to restrict ourselves to about four
edgarallanpoe,ounces of the meat per day; the whole would thus last us thirteen days.
edgarallanpoe,"A brisk shower, with severe thunder and lightning, came on about dusk,"
edgarallanpoe,but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about
edgarallanpoe,"half a pint of water. The whole of this, by common consent, was given"
edgarallanpoe,"to Augustus, who now appeared to be in the last extremity. He drank the"
edgarallanpoe,water from the sheet as we caught it (we holding it above him as he lay
edgarallanpoe,"so as to let it run into his mouth), for we had now nothing left capable"
edgarallanpoe,"of holding water, unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the"
edgarallanpoe,"carboy, or the stale water from the jug. Either of these expedients"
edgarallanpoe,would have been resorted to had the shower lasted.
edgarallanpoe,The sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught. His
edgarallanpoe,"arm was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder, and his feet"
edgarallanpoe,were like ice. We expected every moment to see him breathe his last.
edgarallanpoe,"He was frightfully emaciated; so much so that, although he weighed a"
edgarallanpoe,"hundred and twenty-seven pounds upon his leaving Nantucket, he now did"
edgarallanpoe,not weigh more than forty or fifty at the farthest. His eyes were sunk
edgarallanpoe,"far in his head, being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his"
edgarallanpoe,"cheeks hung so loosely as to prevent his masticating any food, or even"
edgarallanpoe,"swallowing any liquid, without great difficulty."
edgarallanpoe,"August 1. A continuance of the same calm weather, with an oppressively"
edgarallanpoe,"hot sun. Suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water in the jug being"
edgarallanpoe,"absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin. We contrived, nevertheless,"
edgarallanpoe,"to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine; our thirst, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"was but little abated. We found more relief by bathing in the sea, but"
edgarallanpoe,"could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals,"
edgarallanpoe,on account of the continual presence of sharks. We now saw clearly that
edgarallanpoe,Augustus could not be saved; that he was evidently dying. We could do
edgarallanpoe,"nothing to relieve his sufferings, which appeared to be great. About"
edgarallanpoe,"twelve o’clock he expired in strong convulsions, and without having"
edgarallanpoe,spoken for several hours. His death filled us with the most gloomy
edgarallanpoe,"forebodings, and had so great an effect upon our spirits that we sat"
edgarallanpoe,"motionless by the corpse during the whole day, and never addressed each"
edgarallanpoe,other except in a whisper. It was not until some time after dark that
edgarallanpoe,we took courage to get up and throw the body overboard. It was then
edgarallanpoe,"loathsome beyond expression, and so far decayed that, as Peters"
edgarallanpoe,"attempted to lift it, an entire leg came off in his grasp. As the mass"
edgarallanpoe,"of putrefaction slipped over the vessel’s side into the water, the glare"
edgarallanpoe,of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly discovered to
edgarallanpoe,"us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of whose horrible teeth, as"
edgarallanpoe,"their prey was torn to pieces among them, might have been heard at"
edgarallanpoe,the distance of a mile. We shrunk within ourselves in the extremity of
edgarallanpoe,horror at the sound.
edgarallanpoe,August 2. The same fearfully calm and hot weather. The dawn found us in
edgarallanpoe,a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion. The water
edgarallanpoe,"in the jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick gelatinous mass;"
edgarallanpoe,"nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with slime. We threw it out,"
edgarallanpoe,"and washed the jug well in the sea, afterward pouring a little vinegar"
edgarallanpoe,in it from our bottles of pickled tortoise. Our thirst could now
edgarallanpoe,"scarcely be endured, and we tried in vain to relieve it by wine, which"
edgarallanpoe,"seemed only to add fuel to the flame, and excited us to a high degree"
edgarallanpoe,of intoxication. We afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings by
edgarallanpoe,mixing the wine with seawater; but this instantly brought about the most
edgarallanpoe,"violent retchings, so that we never again attempted it. During the whole"
edgarallanpoe,"day we anxiously sought an opportunity of bathing, but to no purpose;"
edgarallanpoe,for the hulk was now entirely besieged on all sides with sharks--no
edgarallanpoe,doubt the identical monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the
edgarallanpoe,"evening before, and who were in momentary expectation of another similar"
edgarallanpoe,feast. This circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and
edgarallanpoe,filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings. We had
edgarallanpoe,"experienced indescribable relief in bathing, and to have this resource"
edgarallanpoe,"cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could bear. Nor,"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed, were we altogether free from the apprehension of immediate"
edgarallanpoe,"danger, for the least slip or false movement would have thrown us"
edgarallanpoe,"at once within reach of those voracious fish, who frequently thrust"
edgarallanpoe,"themselves directly upon us, swimming up to leeward. No shouts or"
edgarallanpoe,exertions on our part seemed to alarm them. Even when one of the largest
edgarallanpoe,"was struck with an axe by Peters and much wounded, he persisted in his"
edgarallanpoe,"attempts to push in where we were. A cloud came up at dusk, but, to our"
edgarallanpoe,"extreme anguish, passed over without discharging itself. It is quite"
edgarallanpoe,impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period. We
edgarallanpoe,"passed a sleepless night, both on this account and through dread of the"
edgarallanpoe,sharks.
edgarallanpoe,"August 3. No prospect of relief, and the brig lying still more and more"
edgarallanpoe,"along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at all."
edgarallanpoe,"Busied ourselves in securing our wine and tortoise-meat, so that we"
edgarallanpoe,might not lose them in the event of our rolling over. Got out two stout
edgarallanpoe,"spikes from the forechains, and, by means of the axe, drove them into"
edgarallanpoe,"the hull to windward within a couple of feet of the water, this not"
edgarallanpoe,"being very far from the keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends. To"
edgarallanpoe,"these spikes we now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than"
edgarallanpoe,their former position beneath the chains. Suffered great agony from
edgarallanpoe,thirst during the whole day--no chance of bathing on account of the
edgarallanpoe,"sharks, which never left us for a moment. Found it impossible to sleep."
edgarallanpoe,August 4. A little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was
edgarallanpoe,"heeling over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the"
edgarallanpoe,"movement. At first the roll was slow and gradual, and we contrived to"
edgarallanpoe,"clamber over to windward very well, having taken the precaution to leave"
edgarallanpoe,ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven in for the provision. But
edgarallanpoe,we had not calculated sufficiently upon the acceleration of the impetus;
edgarallanpoe,"for, presently the heel became too violent to allow of our keeping pace"
edgarallanpoe,"with it; and, before either of us knew what was to happen, we found"
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves hurled furiously into the sea, and struggling several fathoms"
edgarallanpoe,"beneath the surface, with the huge hull immediately above us."
edgarallanpoe,In going under the water I had been obliged to let go my hold upon
edgarallanpoe,"the rope; and finding that I was completely beneath the vessel, and"
edgarallanpoe,"my strength nearly exhausted, I scarcely made a struggle for life,"
edgarallanpoe,"and resigned myself, in a few seconds, to die. But here again I was"
edgarallanpoe,"deceived, not having taken into consideration the natural rebound of"
edgarallanpoe,"the hull to windward. The whirl of the water upward, which the vessel"
edgarallanpoe,"occasioned in rolling partially back, brought me to the surface still"
edgarallanpoe,more violently than I had been plunged beneath. Upon coming up I found
edgarallanpoe,"myself about twenty yards from the hulk, as near as I could judge. She"
edgarallanpoe,"was lying keel up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the sea in"
edgarallanpoe,"all directions around was much agitated, and full of strong whirlpools."
edgarallanpoe,I could see nothing of Peters. An oil-cask was floating within a few
edgarallanpoe,"feet of me, and various other articles from the brig were scattered"
edgarallanpoe,about.
edgarallanpoe,"My principal terror was now on account of the sharks, which I knew to be"
edgarallanpoe,"in my vicinity. In order to deter these, if possible, from approaching"
edgarallanpoe,"me, I splashed the water vigorously with both hands and feet as I swam"
edgarallanpoe,"towards the hulk, creating a body of foam. I have no doubt that to this"
edgarallanpoe,"expedient, simple as it was, I was indebted for my preservation; for"
edgarallanpoe,"the sea all round the brig, just before her rolling over, was so crowded"
edgarallanpoe,"with these monsters, that I must have been, and really was, in actual"
edgarallanpoe,"contact with some of them during my progress. By great good fortune,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, I reached the side of the vessel in safety, although so utterly"
edgarallanpoe,weakened by the violent exertion I had used that I should never have
edgarallanpoe,"been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of Peters, who,"
edgarallanpoe,"now, to my great joy, made his appearance (having scrambled up to the"
edgarallanpoe,"keel from the opposite side of the hull), and threw me the end of a"
edgarallanpoe,rope--one of those which had been attached to the spikes.
edgarallanpoe,"Having barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed to the"
edgarallanpoe,dreadful imminency of another--that of absolute starvation. Our whole
edgarallanpoe,stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our care in
edgarallanpoe,securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of obtaining
edgarallanpoe,"more, we gave way both of us to despair, weeping aloud like children,"
edgarallanpoe,and neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the other. Such
edgarallanpoe,"weakness can scarcely be conceived, and to those who have never been"
edgarallanpoe,"similarly situated will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it must be"
edgarallanpoe,remembered that our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long
edgarallanpoe,"course of privation and terror to which we had been subjected, that we"
edgarallanpoe,"could not justly be considered, at that period, in the light of rational"
edgarallanpoe,"beings. In subsequent perils, nearly as great, if not greater, I bore"
edgarallanpoe,"up with fortitude against all the evils of my situation, and Peters, it"
edgarallanpoe,"will be seen, evinced a stoical philosophy nearly as incredible as his"
edgarallanpoe,present childlike supineness and imbecility--the mental condition made
edgarallanpoe,the difference.
edgarallanpoe,"The overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the"
edgarallanpoe,"wine and turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation more"
edgarallanpoe,"deplorable than before, except for the disappearance of the bedclothes"
edgarallanpoe,"by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch rainwater, and of the jug"
edgarallanpoe,"in which we had kept it when caught; for we found the whole bottom, from"
edgarallanpoe,"within two or three feet of the bends as far as the keel, together with"
edgarallanpoe,"the keel itself, thickly covered with large barnacles, which proved"
edgarallanpoe,"to be excellent and highly nutritious food. Thus, in two important"
edgarallanpoe,"respects, the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a benefit"
edgarallanpoe,rather than an injury; it had opened to us a supply of provisions which
edgarallanpoe,"we could not have exhausted, using it moderately, in a month; and it had"
edgarallanpoe,"greatly contributed to our comfort as regards position, we being much"
edgarallanpoe,"more at ease, and in infinitely less danger, than before."
edgarallanpoe,"The difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all the"
edgarallanpoe,benefits of the change in our condition. That we might be ready to avail
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which might fall we took"
edgarallanpoe,"off our shirts, to make use of them as we had of the sheets--not hoping,"
edgarallanpoe,"of course, to get more in this way, even under the most favorable"
edgarallanpoe,"circumstances, than half a gill at a time. No signs of a cloud appeared"
edgarallanpoe,"during the day, and the agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable."
edgarallanpoe,"At night, Peters obtained about an hour’s disturbed sleep, but my"
edgarallanpoe,intense sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single
edgarallanpoe,moment.
edgarallanpoe,"August 5. To-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a vast"
edgarallanpoe,"quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as to find eleven"
edgarallanpoe,"small crabs, which afforded us several delicious meals. Their shells"
edgarallanpoe,"being quite soft, we ate them entire, and found that they irritated our"
edgarallanpoe,thirst far less than the barnacles. Seeing no trace of sharks among the
edgarallanpoe,"seaweed, we also ventured to bathe, and remained in the water for four"
edgarallanpoe,"or five hours, during which we experienced a very sensible diminution"
edgarallanpoe,"of our thirst. Were greatly refreshed, and spent the night somewhat more"
edgarallanpoe,"comfortably than before, both of us snatching a little sleep."
edgarallanpoe,"August 6. This day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain,"
edgarallanpoe,lasting from about noon until after dark. Bitterly did we now regret the
edgarallanpoe,"loss of our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the little means we had of"
edgarallanpoe,"catching the water, we might have filled one, if not both of them. As"
edgarallanpoe,"it was, we contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by suffering"
edgarallanpoe,"the shirts to become saturated, and then wringing them so as to let the"
edgarallanpoe,grateful fluid trickle into our mouths. In this occupation we passed the
edgarallanpoe,entire day.
edgarallanpoe,August 7. Just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a
edgarallanpoe,"sail to the eastward, and _evidently coming towards us!_ We hailed the"
edgarallanpoe,"glorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of rapture; and began"
edgarallanpoe,"instantly to make every signal in our power, by flaring the shirts in"
edgarallanpoe,"the air, leaping as high as our weak condition would permit, and even by"
edgarallanpoe,"hallooing with all the strength of our lungs, although the vessel"
edgarallanpoe,"could not have been less than fifteen miles distant. However, she"
edgarallanpoe,"still continued to near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her"
edgarallanpoe,"present course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us. In"
edgarallanpoe,"about an hour after we first discovered her, we could clearly see the"
edgarallanpoe,"people on her decks. She was a long, low, and rakish-looking topsail"
edgarallanpoe,"schooner, with a black ball in her foretopsail, and had, apparently,"
edgarallanpoe,"a full crew. We now became alarmed, for we could hardly imagine it"
edgarallanpoe,"possible that she did not observe us, and were apprehensive that she"
edgarallanpoe,"meant to leave us to perish as we were--an act of fiendish barbarity,"
edgarallanpoe,"which, however incredible it may appear, has been repeatedly perpetuated"
edgarallanpoe,"at sea, under circumstances very nearly similar, and by beings who"
edgarallanpoe,"were regarded as belonging to the human species. {*2} In this instance,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, by the mercy of God, we were destined to be most happily"
edgarallanpoe,"deceived; for, presently we were aware of a sudden commotion on the deck"
edgarallanpoe,"of the stranger, who immediately afterward ran up a British flag, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"hauling her wind, bore up directly upon us. In half an hour more"
edgarallanpoe,"we found ourselves in her cabin. She proved to be the Jane Guy, of"
edgarallanpoe,"Liverpool, Captain Guy, bound on a sealing and trading voyage to the"
edgarallanpoe,South Seas and Pacific.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 14
edgarallanpoe,THE _Jane Guy_ was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred and
edgarallanpoe,"eighty tons burden. She was unusually sharp in the bows, and on a wind,"
edgarallanpoe,"in moderate weather, the fastest sailer I have ever seen. Her qualities,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so good, and her draught of water"
edgarallanpoe,was by far too great for the trade to which she was destined. For this
edgarallanpoe,"peculiar service, a larger vessel, and one of a light proportionate"
edgarallanpoe,"draught, is desirable--say a vessel of from three hundred to three"
edgarallanpoe,"hundred and fifty tons. She should be bark-rigged, and in other respects"
edgarallanpoe,of a different construction from the usual South Sea ships. It is
edgarallanpoe,"absolutely necessary that she should be well armed. She should have, say"
edgarallanpoe,"ten or twelve twelve-pound carronades, and two or three long twelves,"
edgarallanpoe,"with brass blunderbusses, and water-tight arm-chests for each top. Her"
edgarallanpoe,anchors and cables should be of far greater strength than is required
edgarallanpoe,"for any other species of trade, and, above all, her crew should be"
edgarallanpoe,"numerous and efficient--not less, for such a vessel as I have described,"
edgarallanpoe,than fifty or sixty able-bodied men. The Jane Guy had a crew of
edgarallanpoe,"thirty-five, all able seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she"
edgarallanpoe,"was not altogether as well armed or otherwise equipped, as a navigator"
edgarallanpoe,acquainted with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have
edgarallanpoe,desired.
edgarallanpoe,"Captain Guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of"
edgarallanpoe,"considerable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had devoted"
edgarallanpoe,"a great portion of his life. He was deficient, however, in energy, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely"
edgarallanpoe,"requisite. He was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed, and was"
edgarallanpoe,invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the South Seas for any
edgarallanpoe,"cargo which might come most readily to hand. He had on board, as usual"
edgarallanpoe,"in such voyages, beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets,"
edgarallanpoe,"saws, adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, spokeshaves,"
edgarallanpoe,"rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread,"
edgarallanpoe,"crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other similar articles."
edgarallanpoe,"The schooner sailed from Liverpool on the tenth of July, crossed the"
edgarallanpoe,"Tropic of Cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty degrees west,"
edgarallanpoe,"and reached Sal, one of the Cape Verd islands, on the twenty-ninth,"
edgarallanpoe,where she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage. On
edgarallanpoe,"the third of August, she left the Cape Verds and steered southwest,"
edgarallanpoe,"stretching over toward the coast of Brazil, so as to cross the equator"
edgarallanpoe,between the meridians of twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude.
edgarallanpoe,This is the course usually taken by vessels bound from Europe to the
edgarallanpoe,"Cape of Good Hope, or by that route to the East Indies. By proceeding"
edgarallanpoe,thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which continually
edgarallanpoe,"prevail on the coast of Guinea, while, in the end, it is found to be the"
edgarallanpoe,"shortest track, as westerly winds are never wanting afterward by which"
edgarallanpoe,to reach the Cape. It was Captain Guy’s intention to make his first
edgarallanpoe,stoppage at Kerguelen’s Land--I hardly know for what reason. On the
edgarallanpoe,"day we were picked up the schooner was off Cape St. Roque, in longitude"
edgarallanpoe,"thirty-one degrees west; so that, when found, we had drifted probably,"
edgarallanpoe,"from north to south, _not less than five-and-twenty degrees!_"
edgarallanpoe,On board the Jane Guy we were treated with all the kindness our
edgarallanpoe,"distressed situation demanded. In about a fortnight, during which time"
edgarallanpoe,"we continued steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes and fine"
edgarallanpoe,"weather, both Peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of"
edgarallanpoe,"our late privation and dreadful sufferings, and we began to remember"
edgarallanpoe,what had passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been
edgarallanpoe,"happily awakened, than as events which had taken place in sober and"
edgarallanpoe,naked reality. I have since found that this species of partial oblivion
edgarallanpoe,"is usually brought about by sudden transition, whether from joy"
edgarallanpoe,to sorrow or from sorrow to joy--the degree of forgetfulness being
edgarallanpoe,"proportioned to the degree of difference in the exchange. Thus, in my"
edgarallanpoe,"own case, I now feel it impossible to realize the full extent of"
edgarallanpoe,the misery which I endured during the days spent upon the hulk. The
edgarallanpoe,"incidents are remembered, but not the feelings which the incidents"
edgarallanpoe,"elicited at the time of their occurrence. I only know, that when they"
edgarallanpoe,"did occur, I then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of"
edgarallanpoe,agony.
edgarallanpoe,We continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of
edgarallanpoe,"greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships, and more"
edgarallanpoe,"frequently with the black or right whale, so called in contradistinction"
edgarallanpoe,"to the spermaceti. These, however, were chiefly found south of the"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty-fifth parallel. On the sixteenth of September, being in the"
edgarallanpoe,"vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, the schooner encountered her first"
edgarallanpoe,"gale of any violence since leaving Liverpool. In this neighborhood, but"
edgarallanpoe,more frequently to the south and east of the promontory (we were to
edgarallanpoe,"the westward), navigators have often to contend with storms from the"
edgarallanpoe,"northward, which rage with great fury. They always bring with them a"
edgarallanpoe,"heavy sea, and one of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous"
edgarallanpoe,"chopping round of the wind, an occurrence almost certain to take place"
edgarallanpoe,during the greatest force of the gale. A perfect hurricane will be
edgarallanpoe,"blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast, and in the next"
edgarallanpoe,"not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction, while from"
edgarallanpoe,the southwest it will come out all at once with a violence almost
edgarallanpoe,inconceivable. A bright spot to the southward is the sure forerunner of
edgarallanpoe,"the change, and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper precautions."
edgarallanpoe,It was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white
edgarallanpoe,"squall, and, as usual, from the northward. By eight it had increased"
edgarallanpoe,"very much, and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas I"
edgarallanpoe,"had then ever beheld. Every thing had been made as snug as possible,"
edgarallanpoe,"but the schooner laboured excessively, and gave evidence of her bad"
edgarallanpoe,"qualities as a seaboat, pitching her forecastle under at every plunge"
edgarallanpoe,and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she
edgarallanpoe,was buried in another. Just before sunset the bright spot for which we
edgarallanpoe,"had been on the look-out made its appearance in the southwest, and in"
edgarallanpoe,an hour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping
edgarallanpoe,"listlessly against the mast. In two minutes more, in spite of every"
edgarallanpoe,"preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends, as if by magic, and a"
edgarallanpoe,perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay. The
edgarallanpoe,"blow from the southwest, however, luckily proved to be nothing more than"
edgarallanpoe,"a squall, and we had the good fortune to right the vessel without the"
edgarallanpoe,loss of a spar. A heavy cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours
edgarallanpoe,"after this, but toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good"
edgarallanpoe,condition as before the gale. Captain Guy considered that he had made an
edgarallanpoe,escape little less than miraculous.
edgarallanpoe,"On the thirteenth of October we came in sight of Prince Edward’s Island,"
edgarallanpoe,"in latitude 46 degrees 53’ S., longitude 37 degrees 46’ E. Two days"
edgarallanpoe,"afterward we found ourselves near Possession Island, and presently"
edgarallanpoe,"passed the islands of Crozet, in latitude 42 degrees 59’ S., longitude"
edgarallanpoe,48 degrees E. On the eighteenth we made Kerguelen’s or Desolation
edgarallanpoe,"Island, in the Southern Indian Ocean, and came to anchor in Christmas"
edgarallanpoe,"Harbour, having four fathoms of water."
edgarallanpoe,"This island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the Cape"
edgarallanpoe,"of Good Hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues. It"
edgarallanpoe,"was first discovered in 1772, by the Baron de Kergulen, or Kerguelen,"
edgarallanpoe,"a Frenchman, who, thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive"
edgarallanpoe,"southern continent carried home information to that effect, which"
edgarallanpoe,"produced much excitement at the time. The government, taking the matter"
edgarallanpoe,"up, sent the baron back in the following year for the purpose of"
edgarallanpoe,"giving his new discovery a critical examination, when the mistake was"
edgarallanpoe,"discovered. In 1777, Captain Cook fell in with the same group, and gave"
edgarallanpoe,"to the principal one the name of Desolation Island, a title which"
edgarallanpoe,"it certainly well deserves. Upon approaching the land, however, the"
edgarallanpoe,"navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of most"
edgarallanpoe,"of the hills, from September to March, are clothed with very brilliant"
edgarallanpoe,verdure. This deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant resembling
edgarallanpoe,"saxifrage, which is abundant, growing in large patches on a species"
edgarallanpoe,of crumbling moss. Besides this plant there is scarcely a sign of
edgarallanpoe,"vegetation on the island, if we except some coarse rank grass near the"
edgarallanpoe,"harbor, some lichen, and a shrub which bears resemblance to a cabbage"
edgarallanpoe,"shooting into seed, and which has a bitter and acrid taste."
edgarallanpoe,"The face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can be"
edgarallanpoe,called lofty. Their tops are perpetually covered with snow. There are
edgarallanpoe,"several harbors, of which Christmas Harbour is the most convenient. It"
edgarallanpoe,is the first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after
edgarallanpoe,"passing Cape Francois, which forms the northern shore, and, by its"
edgarallanpoe,"peculiar shape, serves to distinguish the harbour. Its projecting point"
edgarallanpoe,"terminates in a high rock, through which is a large hole, forming a"
edgarallanpoe,"natural arch. The entrance is in latitude 48 degrees 40’ S., longitude"
edgarallanpoe,"69 degrees 6’ E. Passing in here, good anchorage may be found under the"
edgarallanpoe,"shelter of several small islands, which form a sufficient protection"
edgarallanpoe,from all easterly winds. Proceeding on eastwardly from this anchorage
edgarallanpoe,"you come to Wasp Bay, at the head of the harbour. This is a small basin,"
edgarallanpoe,"completely landlocked, into which you can go with four fathoms, and find"
edgarallanpoe,"anchorage in from ten to three, hard clay bottom. A ship might lie"
edgarallanpoe,here with her best bower ahead all the year round without risk. To the
edgarallanpoe,"westward, at the head of Wasp Bay, is a small stream of excellent water,"
edgarallanpoe,easily procured.
edgarallanpoe,Some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on
edgarallanpoe,"Kerguelen’s Island, and sea elephants abound. The feathered tribes are"
edgarallanpoe,"discovered in great numbers. Penguins are very plenty, and of these"
edgarallanpoe,"there are four different kinds. The royal penguin, so called from its"
edgarallanpoe,"size and beautiful plumage, is the largest. The upper part of the body"
edgarallanpoe,"is usually gray, sometimes of a lilac tint; the under portion of the"
edgarallanpoe,purest white imaginable. The head is of a glossy and most brilliant
edgarallanpoe,"black, the feet also. The chief beauty of plumage, however, consists in"
edgarallanpoe,"two broad stripes of a gold color, which pass along from the head to the"
edgarallanpoe,"breast. The bill is long, and either pink or bright scarlet. These birds"
edgarallanpoe,walk erect; with a stately carriage. They carry their heads high with
edgarallanpoe,"their wings drooping like two arms, and, as their tails project from"
edgarallanpoe,"their body in a line with the legs, the resemblance to a human figure"
edgarallanpoe,"is very striking, and would be apt to deceive the spectator at a casual"
edgarallanpoe,glance or in the gloom of the evening. The royal penguins which we met
edgarallanpoe,with on Kerguelen’s Land were rather larger than a goose. The other
edgarallanpoe,"kinds are the macaroni, the jackass, and the rookery penguin. These"
edgarallanpoe,"are much smaller, less beautiful in plumage, and different in other"
edgarallanpoe,respects.
edgarallanpoe,"Besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among which"
edgarallanpoe,"may be mentioned sea-hens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, Port Egmont hens,"
edgarallanpoe,"shags, Cape pigeons, the nelly, sea swallows, terns, sea gulls, Mother"
edgarallanpoe,"Carey’s chickens, Mother Carey’s geese, or the great peterel, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"lastly, the albatross."
edgarallanpoe,"The great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is"
edgarallanpoe,"carnivorous. It is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey peterel."
edgarallanpoe,"They are not at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are palatable food."
edgarallanpoe,"In flying they sometimes sail very close to the surface of the water,"
edgarallanpoe,"with the wings expanded, without appearing to move them in the least"
edgarallanpoe,"degree, or make any exertion with them whatever."
edgarallanpoe,The albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the South Sea birds.
edgarallanpoe,"It is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing, never coming"
edgarallanpoe,on land except for the purpose of breeding. Between this bird and the
edgarallanpoe,penguin the most singular friendship exists. Their nests are
edgarallanpoe,constructed with great uniformity upon a plan concerted between the two
edgarallanpoe,species--that of the albatross being placed in the centre of a little
edgarallanpoe,square formed by the nests of four penguins. Navigators have agreed in
edgarallanpoe,calling an assemblage of such encampments a rookery. These rookeries
edgarallanpoe,"have been often described, but as my readers may not all have seen these"
edgarallanpoe,"descriptions, and as I shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the"
edgarallanpoe,"penguin and albatross, it will not be amiss to say something here of"
edgarallanpoe,their mode of building and living.
edgarallanpoe,"When the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in vast"
edgarallanpoe,"numbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon the proper"
edgarallanpoe,course to be pursued. At length they proceed to action. A level piece of
edgarallanpoe,"ground is selected, of suitable extent, usually comprising three or four"
edgarallanpoe,"acres, and situated as near the sea as possible, being still beyond its"
edgarallanpoe,"reach. The spot is chosen with reference to its evenness of surface, and"
edgarallanpoe,that is preferred which is the least encumbered with stones. This
edgarallanpoe,"matter being arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord, and actuated"
edgarallanpoe,"apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical accuracy, either"
edgarallanpoe,"a square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the nature of the"
edgarallanpoe,"ground, and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily all the birds"
edgarallanpoe,"assembled, and no more--in this particular seeming determined upon"
edgarallanpoe,preventing the access of future stragglers who have not participated in
edgarallanpoe,the labor of the encampment. One side of the place thus marked out runs
edgarallanpoe,"parallel with the water’s edge, and is left open for ingress or egress."
edgarallanpoe,"Having defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to clear"
edgarallanpoe,"it of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone, and carrying"
edgarallanpoe,"them outside of the lines, and close by them, so as to form a wall on"
edgarallanpoe,the three inland sides. Just within this wall a perfectly level and
edgarallanpoe,"smooth walk is formed, from six to eight feet wide, and extending around"
edgarallanpoe,the encampment--thus serving the purpose of a general promenade.
edgarallanpoe,The next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares
edgarallanpoe,"exactly equal in size. This is done by forming narrow paths, very"
edgarallanpoe,"smooth, and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire"
edgarallanpoe,extent of the rookery. At each intersection of these paths the nest of
edgarallanpoe,"an albatross is constructed, and a penguin’s nest in the centre of each"
edgarallanpoe,"square--thus every penguin is surrounded by four albatrosses, and each"
edgarallanpoe,albatross by a like number of penguins. The penguin’s nest consists of a
edgarallanpoe,"hole in the earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth to"
edgarallanpoe,keep her single egg from rolling. The albatross is somewhat less simple
edgarallanpoe,"in her arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high and two in"
edgarallanpoe,"diameter. This is made of earth, seaweed, and shells. On its summit she"
edgarallanpoe,builds her nest.
edgarallanpoe,The birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for
edgarallanpoe,"an instant during the period of incubation, or, indeed, until the young"
edgarallanpoe,progeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves. While the
edgarallanpoe,"male is absent at sea in search of food, the female remains on duty, and"
edgarallanpoe,it is only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad. The
edgarallanpoe,eggs are never left uncovered at all--while one bird leaves the nest the
edgarallanpoe,other nestling in by its side. This precaution is rendered necessary
edgarallanpoe,"by the thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery, the inhabitants"
edgarallanpoe,making no scruple to purloin each other’s eggs at every good
edgarallanpoe,opportunity.
edgarallanpoe,Although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and albatross are
edgarallanpoe,"the sole population, yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds"
edgarallanpoe,"are to be met with, enjoying all the privileges of citizenship, and"
edgarallanpoe,"scattering their nests here and there, wherever they can find room,"
edgarallanpoe,"never interfering, however, with the stations of the larger species."
edgarallanpoe,"The appearance of such encampments, when seen from a distance, is"
edgarallanpoe,exceedingly singular. The whole atmosphere just above the settlement
edgarallanpoe,is darkened with the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the
edgarallanpoe,"smaller tribes) which are continually hovering over it, either going to"
edgarallanpoe,the ocean or returning home. At the same time a crowd of penguins are
edgarallanpoe,"to be observed, some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys, and some"
edgarallanpoe,"marching with the military strut so peculiar to them, around the general"
edgarallanpoe,"promenade ground which encircles the rookery. In short, survey it as"
edgarallanpoe,"we will, nothing can be more astonishing than the spirit of reflection"
edgarallanpoe,"evinced by these feathered beings, and nothing surely can be better"
edgarallanpoe,calculated to elicit reflection in every well-regulated human intellect.
edgarallanpoe,"On the morning after our arrival in Christmas Harbour the chief mate,"
edgarallanpoe,"Mr. Patterson, took the boats, and (although it was somewhat early in"
edgarallanpoe,"the season) went in search of seal, leaving the captain and a young"
edgarallanpoe,"relation of his on a point of barren land to the westward, they having"
edgarallanpoe,"some business, whose nature I could not ascertain, to transact in the"
edgarallanpoe,"interior of the island. Captain Guy took with him a bottle, in which was"
edgarallanpoe,"a sealed letter, and made his way from the point on which he was set on"
edgarallanpoe,shore toward one of the highest peaks in the place. It is probable that
edgarallanpoe,his design was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel
edgarallanpoe,which he expected to come after him. As soon as we lost sight of him
edgarallanpoe,we proceeded (Peters and myself being in the mate’s boat) on our cruise
edgarallanpoe,"around the coast, looking for seal. In this business we were occupied"
edgarallanpoe,"about three weeks, examining with great care every nook and corner,"
edgarallanpoe,"not only of Kerguelen’s Land, but of the several small islands in the"
edgarallanpoe,"vicinity. Our labours, however, were not crowned with any important"
edgarallanpoe,"success. We saw a great many fur seal, but they were exceedingly shy,"
edgarallanpoe,"and with the greatest exertions, we could only procure three hundred"
edgarallanpoe,"and fifty skins in all. Sea elephants were abundant, especially on the"
edgarallanpoe,"western coast of the mainland, but of these we killed only twenty, and"
edgarallanpoe,this with great difficulty. On the smaller islands we discovered a
edgarallanpoe,"good many of the hair seal, but did not molest them. We returned to the"
edgarallanpoe,"schooner on the eleventh, where we found Captain Guy and his nephew,"
edgarallanpoe,"who gave a very bad account of the interior, representing it as one"
edgarallanpoe,of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the world. They had
edgarallanpoe,"remained two nights on the island, owing to some misunderstanding, on"
edgarallanpoe,"the part of the second mate, in regard to the sending a jollyboat from"
edgarallanpoe,the schooner to take them off.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 15
edgarallanpoe,ON the twelfth we made sail from Christmas Harbour retracing our way to
edgarallanpoe,"the westward, and leaving Marion’s Island, one of Crozet’s group, on the"
edgarallanpoe,"larboard. We afterward passed Prince Edward’s Island, leaving it also on"
edgarallanpoe,"our left, then, steering more to the northward, made, in fifteen days,"
edgarallanpoe,"the islands of Tristan d’Acunha, in latitude 37 degrees 8’ S, longitude"
edgarallanpoe,12 degrees 8’ W.
edgarallanpoe,"This group, now so well known, and which consists of three circular"
edgarallanpoe,"islands, was first discovered by the Portuguese, and was visited"
edgarallanpoe,"afterward by the Dutch in 1643, and by the French in 1767. The three"
edgarallanpoe,"islands together form a triangle, and are distant from each other about"
edgarallanpoe,"ten miles, there being fine open passages between. The land in all of"
edgarallanpoe,"them is very high, especially in Tristan d’Acunha, properly so called."
edgarallanpoe,"This is the largest of the group, being fifteen miles in circumference,"
edgarallanpoe,and so elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of
edgarallanpoe,eighty or ninety miles. A part of the land toward the north rises more
edgarallanpoe,than a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea. A tableland at this
edgarallanpoe,"height extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from this"
edgarallanpoe,tableland arises a lofty cone like that of Teneriffe. The lower half of
edgarallanpoe,"this cone is clothed with trees of good size, but the upper region is"
edgarallanpoe,"barren rock, usually hidden among the clouds, and covered with snow"
edgarallanpoe,during the greater part of the year. There are no shoals or other
edgarallanpoe,"dangers about the island, the shores being remarkably bold and the water"
edgarallanpoe,"deep. On the northwestern coast is a bay, with a beach of black sand"
edgarallanpoe,"where a landing with boats can be easily effected, provided there be a"
edgarallanpoe,southerly wind. Plenty of excellent water may here be readily procured;
edgarallanpoe,also cod and other fish may be taken with hook and line.
edgarallanpoe,"The next island in point of size, and the most westwardly of the group,"
edgarallanpoe,is that called the Inaccessible. Its precise situation is 37 degrees 17’
edgarallanpoe,"S. latitude, longitude 12 degrees 24’ W. It is seven or eight miles in"
edgarallanpoe,"circumference, and on all sides presents a forbidding and precipitous"
edgarallanpoe,"aspect. Its top is perfectly flat, and the whole region is sterile,"
edgarallanpoe,nothing growing upon it except a few stunted shrubs.
edgarallanpoe,"Nightingale Island, the smallest and most southerly, is in latitude 37"
edgarallanpoe,"degrees 26’ S., longitude 12 degrees 12’ W. Off its southern extremity"
edgarallanpoe,is a high ledge of rocky islets; a few also of a similar appearance are
edgarallanpoe,"seen to the northeast. The ground is irregular and sterile, and a deep"
edgarallanpoe,valley partially separates it.
edgarallanpoe,"The shores of these islands abound, in the proper season, with sea"
edgarallanpoe,"lions, sea elephants, the hair and fur seal, together with a great"
edgarallanpoe,variety of oceanic birds. Whales are also plenty in their vicinity.
edgarallanpoe,Owing to the ease with which these various animals were here formerly
edgarallanpoe,"taken, the group has been much visited since its discovery. The Dutch"
edgarallanpoe,"and French frequented it at a very early period. In 1790, Captain"
edgarallanpoe,"Patten, of the ship Industry, of Philadelphia, made Tristan d’Acunha,"
edgarallanpoe,"where he remained seven months (from August, 1790, to April, 1791) for"
edgarallanpoe,the purpose of collecting sealskins. In this time he gathered no less
edgarallanpoe,"than five thousand six hundred, and says that he would have had no"
edgarallanpoe,difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks. Upon his
edgarallanpoe,"arrival he found no quadrupeds, with the exception of a few wild goats;"
edgarallanpoe,"the island now abounds with all our most valuable domestic animals,"
edgarallanpoe,which have been introduced by subsequent navigators.
edgarallanpoe,I believe it was not long after Captain Patten’s visit that Captain
edgarallanpoe,"Colquhoun, of the American brig Betsey, touched at the largest of the"
edgarallanpoe,"islands for the purpose of refreshment. He planted onions, potatoes,"
edgarallanpoe,"cabbages, and a great many other vegetables, an abundance of all which"
edgarallanpoe,is now to be met with.
edgarallanpoe,"In 1811, a Captain Haywood, in the Nereus, visited Tristan. He found"
edgarallanpoe,"there three Americans, who were residing upon the island to prepare"
edgarallanpoe,"sealskins and oil. One of these men was named Jonathan Lambert, and"
edgarallanpoe,he called himself the sovereign of the country. He had cleared and
edgarallanpoe,"cultivated about sixty acres of land, and turned his attention to"
edgarallanpoe,"raising the coffee-plant and sugar-cane, with which he had been"
edgarallanpoe,"furnished by the American Minister at Rio Janeiro. This settlement,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, was finally abandoned, and in 1817 the islands were taken"
edgarallanpoe,"possession of by the British Government, who sent a detachment for that"
edgarallanpoe,"purpose from the Cape of Good Hope. They did not, however, retain them"
edgarallanpoe,"long; but, upon the evacuation of the country as a British possession,"
edgarallanpoe,two or three English families took up their residence there
edgarallanpoe,"independently of the Government. On the twenty-fifth of March, 1824, the"
edgarallanpoe,"Berwick, Captain Jeffrey, from London to Van Diemen’s Land, arrived at"
edgarallanpoe,"the place, where they found an Englishman of the name of Glass, formerly"
edgarallanpoe,a corporal in the British artillery. He claimed to be supreme governor
edgarallanpoe,"of the islands, and had under his control twenty-one men and three"
edgarallanpoe,women. He gave a very favourable account of the salubrity of the
edgarallanpoe,climate and of the productiveness of the soil. The population occupied
edgarallanpoe,"themselves chiefly in collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil,"
edgarallanpoe,"with which they traded to the Cape of Good Hope, Glass owning a"
edgarallanpoe,small schooner. At the period of our arrival the governor was still a
edgarallanpoe,"resident, but his little community had multiplied, there being"
edgarallanpoe,"fifty-six persons upon Tristan, besides a smaller settlement of seven on"
edgarallanpoe,Nightingale Island. We had no difficulty in procuring almost every
edgarallanpoe,"kind of refreshment which we required--sheep, hogs, bullocks, rabbits,"
edgarallanpoe,"poultry, goats, fish in great variety, and vegetables were abundant."
edgarallanpoe,"Having come to anchor close in with the large island, in eighteen"
edgarallanpoe,"fathoms, we took all we wanted on board very conveniently. Captain"
edgarallanpoe,Guy also purchased of Glass five hundred sealskins and some ivory. We
edgarallanpoe,"remained here a week, during which the prevailing winds were from the"
edgarallanpoe,"northward and westward, and the weather somewhat hazy. On the fifth of"
edgarallanpoe,"November we made sail to the southward and westward, with the intention"
edgarallanpoe,"of having a thorough search for a group of islands called the Auroras,"
edgarallanpoe,respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has existed.
edgarallanpoe,"These islands are said to have been discovered as early as 1762, by the"
edgarallanpoe,"commander of the ship Aurora. In 1790, Captain Manuel de Oyarvido, in"
edgarallanpoe,"the ship Princess, belonging to the Royal Philippine Company, sailed, as"
edgarallanpoe,"he asserts, directly among them. In 1794, the Spanish corvette Atrevida"
edgarallanpoe,"went with the determination of ascertaining their precise situation,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, in a paper published by the Royal Hydrographical Society of"
edgarallanpoe,"Madrid in the year 1809, the following language is used respecting"
edgarallanpoe,"this expedition: “The corvette Atrevida practised, in their immediate"
edgarallanpoe,"vicinity, from the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of January, all"
edgarallanpoe,"the necessary observations, and measured by chronometers the difference"
edgarallanpoe,of longitude between these islands and the port of Soledad in the
edgarallanpoe,"Manillas. The islands are three, they are very nearly in the same"
edgarallanpoe,"meridian; the centre one is rather low, and the other two may be seen"
edgarallanpoe,at nine leagues’ distance.” The observations made on board the Atrevida
edgarallanpoe,give the following results as the precise situation of each island.
edgarallanpoe,"The most northern is in latitude 52 degrees 37’ 24” S., longitude 47"
edgarallanpoe,"degrees, 43’ 15” W.; the middle one in latitude 53 degrees 2’ 40” S.,"
edgarallanpoe,longitude 47 degrees 55’ 15” W.; and the most southern in latitude 53
edgarallanpoe,"degrees 15’ 22” S., longitude 47 degrees 57’ 15” W."
edgarallanpoe,"On the twenty-seventh of January, 1820, Captain James Weddel, of the"
edgarallanpoe,"British navy, sailed from Staten Land also in search of the Auroras. He"
edgarallanpoe,"reports that, having made the most diligent search and passed not only"
edgarallanpoe,"immediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the Atrevida,"
edgarallanpoe,"but in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots, he"
edgarallanpoe,could discover no indication of land. These conflicting statements have
edgarallanpoe,"induced other navigators to look out for the islands; and, strange to"
edgarallanpoe,"say, while some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are"
edgarallanpoe,"supposed to lie without finding them, there have been not a few who"
edgarallanpoe,declare positively that they have seen them; and even been close in
edgarallanpoe,with their shores. It was Captain Guy’s intention to make every exertion
edgarallanpoe,within his power to settle the question so oddly in dispute. {*3}
edgarallanpoe,"We kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable"
edgarallanpoe,"weather, until the twentieth of the month, when we found ourselves on"
edgarallanpoe,"the debated ground, being in latitude 53 degrees 15’ S., longitude 47"
edgarallanpoe,"degrees 58’ W.--that is to say, very nearly upon the spot indicated as"
edgarallanpoe,the situation of the most southern of the group. Not perceiving any sign
edgarallanpoe,"of land, we continued to the westward of the parallel of fifty-three"
edgarallanpoe,"degrees south, as far as the meridian of fifty degrees west. We then"
edgarallanpoe,"stood to the north as far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south,"
edgarallanpoe,"when we turned to the eastward, and kept our parallel by double"
edgarallanpoe,"altitudes, morning and evening, and meridian altitudes of the planets"
edgarallanpoe,and moon. Having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western
edgarallanpoe,"coast of Georgia, we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude"
edgarallanpoe,from which we set out. We then took diagonal courses throughout the
edgarallanpoe,"entire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a lookout constantly at the"
edgarallanpoe,"masthead, and repeating our examination with the greatest care for a"
edgarallanpoe,"period of three weeks, during which the weather was remarkably pleasant"
edgarallanpoe,"and fair, with no haze whatsoever. Of course we were thoroughly"
edgarallanpoe,"satisfied that, whatever islands might have existed in this vicinity at"
edgarallanpoe,"any former period, no vestige of them remained at the present day. Since"
edgarallanpoe,"my return home I find that the same ground was traced over, with equal"
edgarallanpoe,"care, in 1822, by Captain Johnson, of the American schooner Henry, and"
edgarallanpoe,by Captain Morrell in the American schooner Wasp--in both cases with the
edgarallanpoe,same result as in our own.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 16
edgarallanpoe,"It had been Captain Guy’s original intention, after satisfying himself"
edgarallanpoe,"about the Auroras, to proceed through the Strait of Magellan, and"
edgarallanpoe,up along the western coast of Patagonia; but information received at
edgarallanpoe,"Tristan d’Acunha induced him to steer to the southward, in the hope of"
edgarallanpoe,falling in with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of
edgarallanpoe,"60 degrees S., longitude 41 degrees 20’ W. In the event of his"
edgarallanpoe,"not discovering these lands, he designed, should the season prove"
edgarallanpoe,"favourable, to push on toward the pole. Accordingly, on the twelfth of"
edgarallanpoe,"December, we made sail in that direction. On the eighteenth we found"
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves about the station indicated by Glass, and cruised for three"
edgarallanpoe,days in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands
edgarallanpoe,"he had mentioned. On the twenty-first, the weather being unusually"
edgarallanpoe,"pleasant, we again made sail to the southward, with the resolution of"
edgarallanpoe,penetrating in that course as far as possible. Before entering upon this
edgarallanpoe,"portion of my narrative, it may be as well, for the information of those"
edgarallanpoe,readers who have paid little attention to the progress of discovery in
edgarallanpoe,"these regions, to give some brief account of the very few attempts at"
edgarallanpoe,reaching the southern pole which have hitherto been made.
edgarallanpoe,That of Captain Cook was the first of which we have any distinct
edgarallanpoe,"account. In 1772 he sailed to the south in the Resolution, accompanied"
edgarallanpoe,by Lieutenant Furneaux in the Adventure. In December he found himself as
edgarallanpoe,"far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south latitude, and in longitude 26"
edgarallanpoe,"degrees 57’ E. Here he met with narrow fields of ice, about eight or ten"
edgarallanpoe,"inches thick, and running northwest and southeast. This ice was in large"
edgarallanpoe,"cakes, and usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great"
edgarallanpoe,"difficulty in forcing a passage. At this period Captain Cook supposed,"
edgarallanpoe,"from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from other indications,"
edgarallanpoe,"that he was in the near vicinity of land. He kept on to the southward,"
edgarallanpoe,"the weather being exceedingly cold, until he reached the sixty-fourth"
edgarallanpoe,"parallel, in longitude 38 degrees 14’ E. Here he had mild weather, with"
edgarallanpoe,"gentle breezes, for five days, the thermometer being at thirty-six. In"
edgarallanpoe,"January, 1773, the vessels crossed the Antarctic circle, but did not"
edgarallanpoe,succeed in penetrating much farther; for upon reaching latitude 67
edgarallanpoe,degrees 15’ they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body
edgarallanpoe,"of ice, extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye could"
edgarallanpoe,"reach. This ice was of every variety--and some large floes of it, miles"
edgarallanpoe,"in extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or twenty feet above"
edgarallanpoe,"the water. It being late in the season, and no hope entertained of"
edgarallanpoe,"rounding these obstructions, Captain Cook now reluctantly turned to the"
edgarallanpoe,northward.
edgarallanpoe,In the November following he renewed his search in the Antarctic. In
edgarallanpoe,latitude 59 degrees 40’ he met with a strong current setting to the
edgarallanpoe,"southward. In December, when the vessels were in latitude 67 degrees"
edgarallanpoe,"31’, longitude 142 degrees 54’ W., the cold was excessive, with heavy"
edgarallanpoe,"gales and fog. Here also birds were abundant; the albatross, the"
edgarallanpoe,"penguin, and the peterel especially. In latitude 70 degrees 23’ some"
edgarallanpoe,"large islands of ice were encountered, and shortly afterward the clouds"
edgarallanpoe,"to the southward were observed to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating"
edgarallanpoe,"the vicinity of field ice. In latitude 71 degrees 10’, longitude 106"
edgarallanpoe,"degrees 54’ W., the navigators were stopped, as before, by an immense"
edgarallanpoe,"frozen expanse, which filled the whole area of the southern horizon. The"
edgarallanpoe,"northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken, so firmly wedged"
edgarallanpoe,"together as to be utterly impassible, and extending about a mile to the"
edgarallanpoe,southward. Behind it the frozen surface was comparatively smooth for
edgarallanpoe,"some distance, until terminated in the extreme background by gigantic"
edgarallanpoe,"ranges of ice mountains, the one towering above the other. Captain Cook"
edgarallanpoe,concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was
edgarallanpoe,"joined to a continent. Mr. J. N. Reynolds, whose great exertions and"
edgarallanpoe,perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot a national
edgarallanpoe,"expedition, partly for the purpose of exploring these regions, thus"
edgarallanpoe,speaks of the attempt of the Resolution. “We are not surprised that
edgarallanpoe,"Captain Cook was unable to go beyond 71 degrees 10’, but we are"
edgarallanpoe,astonished that he did attain that point on the meridian of 106 degrees
edgarallanpoe,"54’ west longitude. Palmer’s Land lies south of the Shetland, latitude"
edgarallanpoe,"sixty-four degrees, and tends to the southward and westward farther than"
edgarallanpoe,any navigator has yet penetrated. Cook was standing for this land when
edgarallanpoe,"his progress was arrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must always"
edgarallanpoe,"be the case in that point, and so early in the season as the sixth"
edgarallanpoe,of January--and we should not be surprised if a portion of the icy
edgarallanpoe,"mountains described was attached to the main body of Palmer’s Land,"
edgarallanpoe,or to some other portions of land lying farther to the southward and
edgarallanpoe,westward.”
edgarallanpoe,"In 1803, Captains Kreutzenstern and Lisiausky were dispatched by"
edgarallanpoe,Alexander of Russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the globe. In
edgarallanpoe,"endeavouring to get south, they made no farther than 59 degrees 58’, in"
edgarallanpoe,longitude 70 degrees 15’ W. They here met with strong currents setting
edgarallanpoe,"eastwardly. Whales were abundant, but they saw no ice. In regard to this"
edgarallanpoe,"voyage, Mr. Reynolds observes that, if Kreutzenstern had arrived where"
edgarallanpoe,"he did earlier in the season, he must have encountered ice--it was March"
edgarallanpoe,"when he reached the latitude specified. The winds, prevailing, as they"
edgarallanpoe,"do, from the southward and westward, had carried the floes, aided by"
edgarallanpoe,"currents, into that icy region bounded on the north by Georgia, east"
edgarallanpoe,"by Sandwich Land and the South Orkneys, and west by the South Shetland"
edgarallanpoe,islands.
edgarallanpoe,"In 1822, Captain James Weddell, of the British navy, with two very small"
edgarallanpoe,"vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any previous navigator,"
edgarallanpoe,"and this, too, without encountering extraordinary difficulties. He"
edgarallanpoe,states that although he was frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching
edgarallanpoe,"the seventy-second parallel, yet, upon attaining it, not a particle was"
edgarallanpoe,"to be discovered, and that, upon arriving at the latitude of 74 degrees"
edgarallanpoe,"15’, no fields, and only three islands of ice were visible. It is"
edgarallanpoe,"somewhat remarkable that, although vast flocks of birds were seen, and"
edgarallanpoe,"other usual indications of land, and although, south of the Shetlands,"
edgarallanpoe,"unknown coasts were observed from the masthead tending southwardly,"
edgarallanpoe,Weddell discourages the idea of land existing in the polar regions of
edgarallanpoe,the south.
edgarallanpoe,"On the 11th of January, 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell, of the American"
edgarallanpoe,"schooner Wasp, sailed from Kerguelen’s Land with a view of penetrating"
edgarallanpoe,as far south as possible. On the first of February he found himself in
edgarallanpoe,"latitude 64 degrees 52’ S., longitude 118 degrees 27’ E. The following"
edgarallanpoe,passage is extracted from his journal of that date. “The wind soon
edgarallanpoe,"freshened to an eleven-knot breeze, and we embraced this opportunity"
edgarallanpoe,of making to the west; being however convinced that the farther we
edgarallanpoe,"went south beyond latitude sixty-four degrees, the less ice was to be"
edgarallanpoe,"apprehended, we steered a little to the southward, until we crossed"
edgarallanpoe,"the Antarctic circle, and were in latitude 69 degrees 15’ E. In this"
edgarallanpoe,"latitude there was no field ice, and very few ice islands in sight.”"
edgarallanpoe,Under the date of March fourteenth I find also this entry. “The sea was
edgarallanpoe,"now entirely free of field ice, and there were not more than a dozen ice"
edgarallanpoe,islands in sight. At the same time the temperature of the air and water
edgarallanpoe,was at least thirteen degrees higher (more mild) than we had ever found
edgarallanpoe,it between the parallels of sixty and sixty-two south. We were now
edgarallanpoe,"in latitude 70 degrees 14’ S., and the temperature of the air was"
edgarallanpoe,"forty-seven, and that of the water forty-four. In this situation I found"
edgarallanpoe,"the variation to be 14 degrees 27’ easterly, per azimuth.... I"
edgarallanpoe,"have several times passed within the Antarctic circle, on different"
edgarallanpoe,"meridians, and have uniformly found the temperature, both of the air and"
edgarallanpoe,"the water, to become more and more mild the farther I advanced beyond"
edgarallanpoe,"the sixty-fifth degree of south latitude, and that the variation"
edgarallanpoe,"decreases in the same proportion. While north of this latitude, say"
edgarallanpoe,"between sixty and sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty"
edgarallanpoe,in finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost
edgarallanpoe,"innumerable ice islands, some of which were from one to two miles in"
edgarallanpoe,"circumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the"
edgarallanpoe,water.”
edgarallanpoe,"Being nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper"
edgarallanpoe,"instruments, it being also late in the season, Captain Morrell was now"
edgarallanpoe,"obliged to put back, without attempting any further progress to the"
edgarallanpoe,"westward, although an entirely open, sea lay before him. He expresses"
edgarallanpoe,"the opinion that, had not these overruling considerations obliged him to"
edgarallanpoe,"retreat, he could have penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at least"
edgarallanpoe,to the eighty-fifth parallel. I have given his ideas respecting these
edgarallanpoe,"matters somewhat at length, that the reader may have an opportunity of"
edgarallanpoe,seeing how far they were borne out by my own subsequent experience.
edgarallanpoe,"In 1831, Captain Briscoe, in the employ of the Messieurs Enderby,"
edgarallanpoe,"whale-ship owners of London, sailed in the brig Lively for the South"
edgarallanpoe,"Seas, accompanied by the cutter Tula. On the twenty-eighth of February,"
edgarallanpoe,"being in latitude 66 degrees 30’ S., longitude 47 degrees 31’ E., he"
edgarallanpoe,"descried land, and “clearly discovered through the snow the black"
edgarallanpoe,peaks of a range of mountains running E. S. E.” He remained in this
edgarallanpoe,"neighbourhood during the whole of the following month, but was unable"
edgarallanpoe,"to approach the coast nearer than within ten leagues, owing to the"
edgarallanpoe,boisterous state of the weather. Finding it impossible to make further
edgarallanpoe,"discovery during this season, he returned northward to winter in Van"
edgarallanpoe,Diemen’s Land.
edgarallanpoe,"In the beginning of 1832 he again proceeded southwardly, and on the"
edgarallanpoe,fourth of February land was seen to the southeast in latitude 67 degrees 15’
edgarallanpoe,longitude 69 degrees 29’ W. This was soon found to be an island near the
edgarallanpoe,headland of the country he had first discovered. On the twenty-first of
edgarallanpoe,"the month he succeeded in landing on the latter, and took possession of"
edgarallanpoe,"it in the name of William IV, calling it Adelaide’s Island, in honour"
edgarallanpoe,of the English queen. These particulars being made known to the Royal
edgarallanpoe,"Geographical Society of London, the conclusion was drawn by that body"
edgarallanpoe,“that there is a continuous tract of land extending from 47 degrees
edgarallanpoe,"30’ E. to 69 degrees 29’ W. longitude, running the parallel of from"
edgarallanpoe,sixty-six to sixty-seven degrees south latitude.” In respect to this
edgarallanpoe,conclusion Mr. Reynolds observes: “In the correctness of it we by
edgarallanpoe,no means concur; nor do the discoveries of Briscoe warrant any such
edgarallanpoe,indifference. It was within these limits that Weddel proceeded south on
edgarallanpoe,"a meridian to the east of Georgia, Sandwich Land, and the South Orkney"
edgarallanpoe,and Shetland islands.” My own experience will be found to testify most
edgarallanpoe,directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the society.
edgarallanpoe,These are the principal attempts which have been made at penetrating to
edgarallanpoe,"a high southern latitude, and it will now be seen that there remained,"
edgarallanpoe,"previous to the voyage of the Jane, nearly three hundred degrees of"
edgarallanpoe,longitude in which the Antarctic circle had not been crossed at all.
edgarallanpoe,"Of course a wide field lay before us for discovery, and it was with"
edgarallanpoe,feelings of most intense interest that I heard Captain Guy express his
edgarallanpoe,resolution of pushing boldly to the southward.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 17
edgarallanpoe,We kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the
edgarallanpoe,"search for Glass’s islands, without meeting with any ice at all. On the"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty-sixth, at noon, we were in latitude 63 degrees 23’ S., longitude"
edgarallanpoe,"41 degrees 25’ W. We now saw several large ice islands, and a floe of"
edgarallanpoe,"field ice, not, however, of any great extent. The winds generally blew"
edgarallanpoe,"from the southeast, or the northeast, but were very light. Whenever we"
edgarallanpoe,"had a westerly wind, which was seldom, it was invariably attended with a"
edgarallanpoe,"rain squall. Every day we had more or less snow. The thermometer, on the"
edgarallanpoe,twenty-seventh stood at thirty-five.
edgarallanpoe,"January 1, 1828.--This day we found ourselves completely hemmed in by"
edgarallanpoe,"the ice, and our prospects looked cheerless indeed. A strong gale blew,"
edgarallanpoe,"during the whole forenoon, from the northeast, and drove large cakes of"
edgarallanpoe,the drift against the rudder and counter with such violence that we all
edgarallanpoe,"trembled for the consequences. Toward evening, the gale still blowing"
edgarallanpoe,"with fury, a large field in front separated, and we were enabled, by"
edgarallanpoe,carrying a press of sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes
edgarallanpoe,into some open water beyond. As we approached this space we took in sail
edgarallanpoe,"by degrees, and having at length got clear, lay-to under a single reefed"
edgarallanpoe,foresail.
edgarallanpoe,January 2.--We had now tolerably pleasant weather. At noon we found
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves in latitude 69 degrees 10’ S, longitude 42 degrees 20’ W,"
edgarallanpoe,having crossed the Antarctic circle. Very little ice was to be seen to
edgarallanpoe,"the southward, although large fields of it lay behind us. This day we"
edgarallanpoe,"rigged some sounding gear, using a large iron pot capable of holding"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty gallons, and a line of two hundred fathoms. We found the"
edgarallanpoe,"current setting to the north, about a quarter of a mile per hour. The"
edgarallanpoe,temperature of the air was now about thirty-three. Here we found the
edgarallanpoe,"variation to be 14 degrees 28’ easterly, per azimuth."
edgarallanpoe,January 5.--We had still held on to the southward without any very great
edgarallanpoe,"impediments. On this morning, however, being in latitude 73 degrees 15’"
edgarallanpoe,"E., longitude 42 degrees 10’ W, we were again brought to a stand by an"
edgarallanpoe,"immense expanse of firm ice. We saw, nevertheless, much open water to"
edgarallanpoe,"the southward, and felt no doubt of being able to reach it eventually."
edgarallanpoe,"Standing to the eastward along the edge of the floe, we at length came"
edgarallanpoe,"to a passage of about a mile in width, through which we warped our way"
edgarallanpoe,by sundown. The sea in which we now were was thickly covered with ice
edgarallanpoe,"islands, but had no field ice, and we pushed on boldly as before. The"
edgarallanpoe,"cold did not seem to increase, although we had snow very frequently,"
edgarallanpoe,and now and then hail squalls of great violence. Immense flocks of
edgarallanpoe,"the albatross flew over the schooner this day, going from southeast to"
edgarallanpoe,northwest.
edgarallanpoe,"January 7.--The sea still remained pretty well open, so that we had"
edgarallanpoe,no difficulty in holding on our course. To the westward we saw some
edgarallanpoe,"icebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed very near one"
edgarallanpoe,whose summit could not have been less than four hundred fathoms from
edgarallanpoe,"the surface of the ocean. Its girth was probably, at the base,"
edgarallanpoe,"three-quarters of a league, and several streams of water were running"
edgarallanpoe,from crevices in its sides. We remained in sight of this island two
edgarallanpoe,"days, and then only lost it in a fog."
edgarallanpoe,January 10.--Early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man
edgarallanpoe,"overboard. He was an American named Peter Vredenburgh, a native of New"
edgarallanpoe,"York, and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner. In"
edgarallanpoe,"going over the bows his foot slipped, and he fell between two cakes"
edgarallanpoe,"of ice, never rising again. At noon of this day we were in latitude 78"
edgarallanpoe,"degrees 30’, longitude 40 degrees 15’ W. The cold was now excessive, and"
edgarallanpoe,we had hail squalls continually from the northward and eastward. In
edgarallanpoe,"this direction also we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole"
edgarallanpoe,"horizon to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising"
edgarallanpoe,"in tiers, one mass above the other. Some driftwood floated by during"
edgarallanpoe,"the evening, and a great quantity of birds flew over, among which were"
edgarallanpoe,"nellies, peterels, albatrosses, and a large bird of a brilliant blue"
edgarallanpoe,"plumage. The variation here, per azimuth, was less than it had been"
edgarallanpoe,previously to our passing the Antarctic circle.
edgarallanpoe,"January 12.--Our passage to the south again looked doubtful, as nothing"
edgarallanpoe,was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently limitless
edgarallanpoe,"floe, backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice, one precipice of which"
edgarallanpoe,arose frowningly above the other. We stood to the westward until the
edgarallanpoe,"fourteenth, in the hope of finding an entrance."
edgarallanpoe,January 14.--This morning we reached the western extremity of the field
edgarallanpoe,"which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open sea, without a"
edgarallanpoe,"particle of ice. Upon sounding with two hundred fathoms, we here found"
edgarallanpoe,a current setting southwardly at the rate of half a mile per hour. The
edgarallanpoe,"temperature of the air was forty-seven, that of the water thirty-four. We"
edgarallanpoe,now sailed to the southward without meeting any interruption of moment
edgarallanpoe,"until the sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude 81 degrees"
edgarallanpoe,"21’, longitude 42 degrees W. We here again sounded, and found a current"
edgarallanpoe,"setting still southwardly, and at the rate of three quarters of a mile"
edgarallanpoe,"per hour. The variation per azimuth had diminished, and the temperature"
edgarallanpoe,"of the air was mild and pleasant, the thermometer being as high as"
edgarallanpoe,fifty-one. At this period not a particle of ice was to be discovered.
edgarallanpoe,All hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole.
edgarallanpoe,January 17.--This day was full of incident. Innumerable flights of birds
edgarallanpoe,"flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from the deck,"
edgarallanpoe,"one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be excellent eating. About"
edgarallanpoe,midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the larboard
edgarallanpoe,"bow, and upon it there appeared to be some large animal. As the weather"
edgarallanpoe,"was good and nearly calm, Captain Guy ordered out two of the boats to"
edgarallanpoe,see what it was. Dirk Peters and myself accompanied the mate in the
edgarallanpoe,"larger boat. Upon coming up with the floe, we perceived that it was in"
edgarallanpoe,"the possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the Arctic bear,"
edgarallanpoe,but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals. Being well
edgarallanpoe,"armed, we made no scruple of attacking it at once. Several shots were"
edgarallanpoe,"fired in quick succession, the most of which took effect, apparently,"
edgarallanpoe,"in the head and body. Nothing discouraged, however, the monster threw"
edgarallanpoe,"himself from the ice, and swam with open jaws, to the boat in which were"
edgarallanpoe,Peters and myself. Owing to the confusion which ensued among us at this
edgarallanpoe,"unexpected turn of the adventure, no person was ready immediately with"
edgarallanpoe,"a second shot, and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his"
edgarallanpoe,"vast bulk across our gunwale, and seizing one of the men by the small"
edgarallanpoe,"of his back, before any efficient means were taken to repel him. In this"
edgarallanpoe,extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of Peters saved us from
edgarallanpoe,"destruction. Leaping upon the back of the huge beast, he plunged the"
edgarallanpoe,"blade of a knife behind the neck, reaching the spinal marrow at a blow."
edgarallanpoe,"The brute tumbled into the sea lifeless, and without a struggle, rolling"
edgarallanpoe,"over Peters as he fell. The latter soon recovered himself, and a rope"
edgarallanpoe,"being thrown him, he secured the carcass before entering the boat. We"
edgarallanpoe,"then returned in triumph to the schooner, towing our trophy behind us."
edgarallanpoe,"This bear, upon admeasurement, proved to be full fifteen feet in his"
edgarallanpoe,"greatest length. His wool was perfectly white, and very coarse, curling"
edgarallanpoe,"tightly. The eyes were of a blood red, and larger than those of the"
edgarallanpoe,"Arctic bear, the snout also more rounded, rather resembling the snout"
edgarallanpoe,"of the bulldog. The meat was tender, but excessively rank and fishy,"
edgarallanpoe,"although the men devoured it with avidity, and declared it excellent"
edgarallanpoe,eating.
edgarallanpoe,"Scarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the masthead"
edgarallanpoe,gave the joyful shout of “land on the starboard bow!” All hands were
edgarallanpoe,"now upon the alert, and, a breeze springing up very opportunely from the"
edgarallanpoe,"northward and eastward, we were soon close in with the coast. It"
edgarallanpoe,"proved to be a low rocky islet, of about a league in circumference, and"
edgarallanpoe,"altogether destitute of vegetation, if we except a species of prickly"
edgarallanpoe,"pear. In approaching it from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is"
edgarallanpoe,"seen projecting into the sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to corded"
edgarallanpoe,"bales of cotton. Around this ledge to the westward is a small bay, at"
edgarallanpoe,the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient landing.
edgarallanpoe,"It did not take us long to explore every portion of the island, but,"
edgarallanpoe,"with one exception, we found nothing worthy of our observation. In the"
edgarallanpoe,"southern extremity, we picked up near the shore, half buried in a pile"
edgarallanpoe,"of loose stones, a piece of wood, which seemed to have formed the prow"
edgarallanpoe,"of a canoe. There had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it,"
edgarallanpoe,"and Captain Guy fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but"
edgarallanpoe,"the resemblance did not strike me very forcibly. Besides this prow, if"
edgarallanpoe,"such it were, we found no other token that any living creature had ever"
edgarallanpoe,been here before. Around the coast we discovered occasional small floes
edgarallanpoe,of ice--but these were very few. The exact situation of the islet (to
edgarallanpoe,"which Captain Guy gave the name of Bennet’s Islet, in honour of his"
edgarallanpoe,"partner in the ownership of the schooner) is 82 degrees 50’ S. latitude,"
edgarallanpoe,42 degrees 20’ W. longitude.
edgarallanpoe,We had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther
edgarallanpoe,"than any previous navigators, and the sea still lay perfectly open"
edgarallanpoe,"before us. We found, too, that the variation uniformly decreased as we"
edgarallanpoe,"proceeded, and, what was still more surprising, that the temperature"
edgarallanpoe,"of the air, and latterly of the water, became milder. The weather might"
edgarallanpoe,"even be called pleasant, and we had a steady but very gentle breeze"
edgarallanpoe,always from some northern point of the compass. The sky was usually
edgarallanpoe,"clear, with now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the"
edgarallanpoe,"southern horizon--this, however, was invariably of brief duration. Two"
edgarallanpoe,difficulties alone presented themselves to our view; we were getting
edgarallanpoe,"short of fuel, and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of"
edgarallanpoe,the crew. These considerations began to impress upon Captain Guy the
edgarallanpoe,"necessity of returning, and he spoke of it frequently. For my own part,"
edgarallanpoe,confident as I was of soon arriving at land of some description upon
edgarallanpoe,"the course we were pursuing, and having every reason to believe, from"
edgarallanpoe,"present appearances, that we should not find it the sterile soil met"
edgarallanpoe,"with in the higher Arctic latitudes, I warmly pressed upon him the"
edgarallanpoe,"expediency of persevering, at least for a few days longer, in the"
edgarallanpoe,direction we were now holding. So tempting an opportunity of solving
edgarallanpoe,the great problem in regard to an Antarctic continent had never yet
edgarallanpoe,"been afforded to man, and I confess that I felt myself bursting with"
edgarallanpoe,indignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our commander.
edgarallanpoe,"I believe, indeed, that what I could not refrain from saying to him on"
edgarallanpoe,"this head had the effect of inducing him to push on. While, therefore,"
edgarallanpoe,I cannot but lament the most unfortunate and bloody events which
edgarallanpoe,"immediately arose from my advice, I must still be allowed to feel some"
edgarallanpoe,"degree of gratification at having been instrumental, however remotely,"
edgarallanpoe,in opening to the eye of science one of the most intensely exciting
edgarallanpoe,secrets which has ever engrossed its attention.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 18
edgarallanpoe,"January 18.--This morning {*4} we continued to the southward, with the"
edgarallanpoe,"same pleasant weather as before. The sea was entirely smooth, the air"
edgarallanpoe,"tolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of the water"
edgarallanpoe,"fifty-three. We now again got our sounding-gear in order, and, with a"
edgarallanpoe,"hundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the current setting toward"
edgarallanpoe,the pole at the rate of a mile an hour. This constant tendency to
edgarallanpoe,"the southward, both in the wind and current, caused some degree of"
edgarallanpoe,"speculation, and even of alarm, in different quarters of the schooner,"
edgarallanpoe,and I saw distinctly that no little impression had been made upon the
edgarallanpoe,"mind of Captain Guy. He was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however,"
edgarallanpoe,and I finally succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions. The
edgarallanpoe,variation was now very trivial. In the course of the day we saw several
edgarallanpoe,"large whales of the right species, and innumerable flights of the"
edgarallanpoe,"albatross passed over the vessel. We also picked up a bush, full of"
edgarallanpoe,"red berries, like those of the hawthorn, and the carcass of a"
edgarallanpoe,"singular-looking land-animal. It was three feet in length, and but six"
edgarallanpoe,"inches in height, with four very short legs, the feet armed with long"
edgarallanpoe,"claws of a brilliant scarlet, and resembling coral in substance. The"
edgarallanpoe,"body was covered with a straight silky hair, perfectly white. The tail"
edgarallanpoe,"was peaked like that of a rat, and about a foot and a half long. The"
edgarallanpoe,"head resembled a cat’s, with the exception of the ears--these were"
edgarallanpoe,flopped like the ears of a dog. The teeth were of the same brilliant
edgarallanpoe,scarlet as the claws.
edgarallanpoe,"January 19.--To-day, being in latitude 83 degrees 20’, longitude 43"
edgarallanpoe,"degrees 5’ W. (the sea being of an extraordinarily dark colour), we"
edgarallanpoe,"again saw land from the masthead, and, upon a closer scrutiny, found it"
edgarallanpoe,"to be one of a group of very large islands. The shore was precipitous,"
edgarallanpoe,"and the interior seemed to be well wooded, a circumstance which"
edgarallanpoe,occasioned us great joy. In about four hours from our first discovering
edgarallanpoe,"the land we came to anchor in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from"
edgarallanpoe,"the coast, as a high surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered"
edgarallanpoe,a nearer approach of doubtful expediency. The two largest boats were
edgarallanpoe,"now ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whom were Peters and"
edgarallanpoe,"myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared to"
edgarallanpoe,"encircle the island. After searching about for some time, we discovered"
edgarallanpoe,"an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw four large canoes put off"
edgarallanpoe,"from the shore, filled with men who seemed to be well armed. We waited"
edgarallanpoe,"for them to come up, and, as they moved with great rapidity, they were"
edgarallanpoe,soon within hail. Captain Guy now held up a white handkerchief on the
edgarallanpoe,"blade of an oar, when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced"
edgarallanpoe,"a loud jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in"
edgarallanpoe,which we could distinguish the words Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! They
edgarallanpoe,"continued this for at least half an hour, during which we had a good"
edgarallanpoe,opportunity of observing their appearance.
edgarallanpoe,"In the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and five"
edgarallanpoe,"broad, there were a hundred and ten savages in all. They were about the"
edgarallanpoe,"ordinary stature of Europeans, but of a more muscular and brawny frame."
edgarallanpoe,"Their complexion a jet black, with thick and long woolly hair. They were"
edgarallanpoe,"clothed in skins of an unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and made"
edgarallanpoe,"to fit the body with some degree of skill, the hair being inside,"
edgarallanpoe,"except where turned out about the neck, wrists, and ankles. Their arms"
edgarallanpoe,"consisted principally of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very heavy"
edgarallanpoe,"wood. Some spears, however, were observed among them, headed with flint,"
edgarallanpoe,and a few slings. The bottoms of the canoes were full of black stones
edgarallanpoe,about the size of a large egg.
edgarallanpoe,When they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they intended
edgarallanpoe,"their jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be the chief stood"
edgarallanpoe,"up in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for us to bring our boats"
edgarallanpoe,"alongside of him. This hint we pretended not to understand, thinking"
edgarallanpoe,"it the wiser plan to maintain, if possible, the interval between us, as"
edgarallanpoe,"their number more than quadrupled our own. Finding this to be the case,"
edgarallanpoe,"the chief ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he advanced"
edgarallanpoe,toward us with his own. As soon as he came up with us he leaped on board
edgarallanpoe,"the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the side of Captain"
edgarallanpoe,"Guy, pointing at the same time to the schooner, and repeating the word"
edgarallanpoe,"Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! We now put back to the vessel, the four"
edgarallanpoe,canoes following at a little distance.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon getting alongside, the chief evinced symptoms of extreme surprise"
edgarallanpoe,"and delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and breast, and"
edgarallanpoe,"laughing obstreperously. His followers behind joined in his merriment,"
edgarallanpoe,and for some minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely
edgarallanpoe,"deafening. Quiet being at length restored, Captain Guy ordered the boats"
edgarallanpoe,"to be hoisted up, as a necessary precaution, and gave the chief (whose"
edgarallanpoe,name we soon found to be Too-wit) to understand that we could admit no
edgarallanpoe,more than twenty of his men on deck at one time. With this arrangement
edgarallanpoe,"he appeared perfectly satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes,"
edgarallanpoe,"when one of them approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off."
edgarallanpoe,"Twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble over"
edgarallanpoe,"every part of the deck, and scramble about among the rigging, making"
edgarallanpoe,"themselves much at home, and examining every article with great"
edgarallanpoe,inquisitiveness.
edgarallanpoe,It was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the white
edgarallanpoe,"race--from whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to recoil. They"
edgarallanpoe,"believed the Jane to be a living creature, and seemed to be afraid of"
edgarallanpoe,"hurting it with the points of their spears, carefully turning them up."
edgarallanpoe,Our crew were much amused with the conduct of Too-wit in one instance.
edgarallanpoe,"The cook was splitting some wood near the galley, and, by accident,"
edgarallanpoe,"struck his axe into the deck, making a gash of considerable depth."
edgarallanpoe,"The chief immediately ran up, and pushing the cook on one side rather"
edgarallanpoe,"roughly, commenced a half whine, half howl, strongly indicative of"
edgarallanpoe,"sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner, patting"
edgarallanpoe,"and smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing it from a bucket of"
edgarallanpoe,seawater which stood by. This was a degree of ignorance for which we
edgarallanpoe,"were not prepared, and for my part I could not help thinking some of it"
edgarallanpoe,affected.
edgarallanpoe,"When the visitors had satisfied, as well as they could, their curiosity"
edgarallanpoe,"in regard to our upper works, they were admitted below, when their"
edgarallanpoe,amazement exceeded all bounds. Their astonishment now appeared to be far
edgarallanpoe,"too deep for words, for they roamed about in silence, broken only by low"
edgarallanpoe,"ejaculations. The arms afforded them much food for speculation, and they"
edgarallanpoe,were suffered to handle and examine them at leisure. I do not believe
edgarallanpoe,"that they had the least suspicion of their actual use, but rather took"
edgarallanpoe,"them for idols, seeing the care we had of them, and the attention with"
edgarallanpoe,which we watched their movements while handling them. At the great guns
edgarallanpoe,their wonder was redoubled. They approached them with every mark of the
edgarallanpoe,"profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine them minutely."
edgarallanpoe,"There were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was the acme of"
edgarallanpoe,"their amazement. Too-wit was the first to approach them, and he had got"
edgarallanpoe,"in the middle of the cabin, with his face to one and his back to the"
edgarallanpoe,"other, before he fairly perceived them. Upon raising his eyes and seeing"
edgarallanpoe,"his reflected self in the glass, I thought the savage would go mad;"
edgarallanpoe,"but, upon turning short round to make a retreat, and beholding himself a"
edgarallanpoe,"second time in the opposite direction, I was afraid he would expire upon"
edgarallanpoe,the spot. No persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look;
edgarallanpoe,"throwing himself upon the floor, with his face buried in his hands, he"
edgarallanpoe,remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon deck.
edgarallanpoe,"The whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner, twenty"
edgarallanpoe,"at a time, Too-wit being suffered to remain during the entire period."
edgarallanpoe,"We saw no disposition to thievery among them, nor did we miss a single"
edgarallanpoe,article after their departure. Throughout the whole of their visit they
edgarallanpoe,"evinced the most friendly manner. There were, however, some points in"
edgarallanpoe,"their demeanour which we found it impossible to understand; for example,"
edgarallanpoe,we could not get them to approach several very harmless objects--such
edgarallanpoe,"as the schooner’s sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan of flour. We"
edgarallanpoe,endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles which might
edgarallanpoe,"be turned to account in the way of traffic, but found great difficulty"
edgarallanpoe,"in being comprehended. We made out, nevertheless, what greatly"
edgarallanpoe,"astonished us, that the islands abounded in the large tortoise of the"
edgarallanpoe,"Gallipagos, one of which we saw in the canoe of Too-wit. We saw also"
edgarallanpoe,"some biche de mer in the hands of one of the savages, who was greedily"
edgarallanpoe,devouring it in its natural state. These anomalies--for they were such
edgarallanpoe,when considered in regard to the latitude--induced Captain Guy to wish
edgarallanpoe,"for a thorough investigation of the country, in the hope of making a"
edgarallanpoe,"profitable speculation in his discovery. For my own part, anxious as I"
edgarallanpoe,"was to know something more of these islands, I was still more earnestly"
edgarallanpoe,bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward without delay. We had
edgarallanpoe,"now fine weather, but there was no telling how long it would last; and"
edgarallanpoe,"being already in the eighty-fourth parallel, with an open sea before us,"
edgarallanpoe,"a current setting strongly to the southward, and the wind fair, I could"
edgarallanpoe,not listen with any patience to a proposition of stopping longer than
edgarallanpoe,was absolutely necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on
edgarallanpoe,board a proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions. I represented to the
edgarallanpoe,"captain that we might easily make this group on our return, and winter"
edgarallanpoe,here in the event of being blocked up by the ice. He at length came into
edgarallanpoe,"my views (for in some way, hardly known to myself, I had acquired much"
edgarallanpoe,"influence over him), and it was finally resolved that, even in the event"
edgarallanpoe,"of our finding biche de mer, we should only stay here a week to recruit,"
edgarallanpoe,and then push on to the southward while we might. Accordingly we made
edgarallanpoe,"every necessary preparation, and, under the guidance of Too-wit, got the"
edgarallanpoe,"Jane through the reef in safety, coming to anchor about a mile from the"
edgarallanpoe,"shore, in an excellent bay, completely landlocked, on the southeastern"
edgarallanpoe,"coast of the main island, and in ten fathoms of water, black sandy"
edgarallanpoe,bottom. At the head of this bay there were three fine springs (we were
edgarallanpoe,"told) of good water, and we saw abundance of wood in the vicinity. The"
edgarallanpoe,"four canoes followed us in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance."
edgarallanpoe,"Too-wit himself remained on board, and, upon our dropping anchor,"
edgarallanpoe,"invited us to accompany him on shore, and visit his village in the"
edgarallanpoe,interior. To this Captain Guy consented; and ten savages being left on
edgarallanpoe,"board as hostages, a party of us, twelve in all, got in readiness to"
edgarallanpoe,"attend the chief. We took care to be well armed, yet without evincing"
edgarallanpoe,"any distrust. The schooner had her guns run out, her boarding-nettings"
edgarallanpoe,"up, and every other proper precaution was taken to guard against"
edgarallanpoe,surprise. Directions were left with the chief mate to admit no person
edgarallanpoe,"on board during our absence, and, in the event of our not appearing in"
edgarallanpoe,"twelve hours, to send the cutter, with a swivel, around the island in"
edgarallanpoe,search of us.
edgarallanpoe,At every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us that
edgarallanpoe,we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto visited
edgarallanpoe,by civilized men. We saw nothing with which we had been formerly
edgarallanpoe,"conversant. The trees resembled no growth of either the torrid, the"
edgarallanpoe,"temperate, or the northern frigid zones, and were altogether unlike"
edgarallanpoe,those of the lower southern latitudes we had already traversed. The very
edgarallanpoe,"rocks were novel in their mass, their color, and their stratification;"
edgarallanpoe,"and the streams themselves, utterly incredible as it may appear, had so"
edgarallanpoe,"little in common with those of other climates, that we were scrupulous"
edgarallanpoe,"of tasting them, and, indeed, had difficulty in bringing ourselves to"
edgarallanpoe,believe that their qualities were purely those of nature. At a small
edgarallanpoe,brook which crossed our path (the first we had reached) Too-wit and his
edgarallanpoe,attendants halted to drink. On account of the singular character of the
edgarallanpoe,"water, we refused to taste it, supposing it to be polluted; and it was"
edgarallanpoe,not until some time afterward we came to understand that such was the
edgarallanpoe,appearance of the streams throughout the whole group. I am at a loss
edgarallanpoe,"to give a distinct idea of the nature of this liquid, and cannot do so"
edgarallanpoe,without many words. Although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities
edgarallanpoe,"where common water would do so, yet never, except when falling in"
edgarallanpoe,"a cascade, had it the customary appearance of limpidity. It was,"
edgarallanpoe,"nevertheless, in point of fact, as perfectly limpid as any limestone"
edgarallanpoe,"water in existence, the difference being only in appearance. At first"
edgarallanpoe,"sight, and especially in cases where little declivity was found, it bore"
edgarallanpoe,"resemblance, as regards consistency, to a thick infusion of gum"
edgarallanpoe,arabic in common water. But this was only the least remarkable of its
edgarallanpoe,"extraordinary qualities. It was not colourless, nor was it of any one"
edgarallanpoe,"uniform colour--presenting to the eye, as it flowed, every possible"
edgarallanpoe,shade of purple; like the hues of a changeable silk. This variation in
edgarallanpoe,shade was produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment
edgarallanpoe,in the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of Too-wit.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon collecting a basinful, and allowing it to settle thoroughly, we"
edgarallanpoe,perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made up of a number of
edgarallanpoe,"distinct veins, each of a distinct hue; that these veins did not"
edgarallanpoe,commingle; and that their cohesion was perfect in regard to their own
edgarallanpoe,"particles among themselves, and imperfect in regard to neighbouring"
edgarallanpoe,"veins. Upon passing the blade of a knife athwart the veins, the water"
edgarallanpoe,"closed over it immediately, as with us, and also, in withdrawing it,"
edgarallanpoe,"all traces of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated. If,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, the blade was passed down accurately between the two veins,"
edgarallanpoe,"a perfect separation was effected, which the power of cohesion did"
edgarallanpoe,not immediately rectify. The phenomena of this water formed the first
edgarallanpoe,definite link in that vast chain of apparent miracles with which I was
edgarallanpoe,destined to be at length encircled.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 19
edgarallanpoe,"We were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more than"
edgarallanpoe,"nine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a rugged country."
edgarallanpoe,"As we passed along, the party of Too-wit (the whole hundred and"
edgarallanpoe,ten savages of the canoes) was momentarily strengthened by smaller
edgarallanpoe,"detachments, of from two to six or seven, which joined us, as if by"
edgarallanpoe,"accident, at different turns of the road. There appeared so much of"
edgarallanpoe,"system in this that I could not help feeling distrust, and I spoke"
edgarallanpoe,"to Captain Guy of my apprehensions. It was now too late, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"to recede, and we concluded that our best security lay in evincing a"
edgarallanpoe,perfect confidence in the good faith of Too-wit. We accordingly went
edgarallanpoe,"on, keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages, and not"
edgarallanpoe,permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between. In this
edgarallanpoe,"way, passing through a precipitous ravine, we at length reached what we"
edgarallanpoe,were told was the only collection of habitations upon the island. As we
edgarallanpoe,"came in sight of them, the chief set up a shout, and frequently repeated"
edgarallanpoe,"the word Klock-klock, which we supposed to be the name of the village,"
edgarallanpoe,or perhaps the generic name for villages.
edgarallanpoe,"The dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable, and,"
edgarallanpoe,unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with which mankind
edgarallanpoe,"are acquainted, were of no uniform plan. Some of them (and these we"
edgarallanpoe,"found belonged to the Wampoos or Yampoos, the great men of the land)"
edgarallanpoe,"consisted of a tree cut down at about four feet from the root, with a"
edgarallanpoe,"large black skin thrown over it, and hanging in loose folds upon the"
edgarallanpoe,ground. Under this the savage nestled. Others were formed by means
edgarallanpoe,"of rough limbs of trees, with the withered foliage upon them, made to"
edgarallanpoe,"recline, at an angle of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay,"
edgarallanpoe,"heaped up, without regular form, to the height of five or six feet."
edgarallanpoe,"Others, again, were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly, and"
edgarallanpoe,"covered over with similar branches, these being removed when the tenant"
edgarallanpoe,"was about to enter, and pulled on again when he had entered. A few were"
edgarallanpoe,"built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood, the upper limbs"
edgarallanpoe,"being partially cut through, so as to bend over upon the lower, thus"
edgarallanpoe,"forming thicker shelter from the weather. The greater number, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"consisted of small shallow caverns, apparently scratched in the face of"
edgarallanpoe,"a precipitous ledge of dark stone, resembling fuller’s earth, with which"
edgarallanpoe,three sides of the village were bounded. At the door of each of these
edgarallanpoe,"primitive caverns was a small rock, which the tenant carefully placed"
edgarallanpoe,"before the entrance upon leaving his residence, for what purpose I could"
edgarallanpoe,"not ascertain, as the stone itself was never of sufficient size to close"
edgarallanpoe,up more than a third of the opening.
edgarallanpoe,"This village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of some"
edgarallanpoe,"depth, and could only be approached from the southward, the precipitous"
edgarallanpoe,ledge of which I have already spoken cutting off all access in other
edgarallanpoe,directions. Through the middle of the valley ran a brawling stream of
edgarallanpoe,the same magical-looking water which has been described. We saw several
edgarallanpoe,"strange animals about the dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly"
edgarallanpoe,domesticated. The largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in
edgarallanpoe,"the structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy, and"
edgarallanpoe,the legs slender as those of the antelope. Its motion was exceedingly
edgarallanpoe,"awkward and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt to run. We noticed"
edgarallanpoe,"also several animals very similar in appearance, but of a greater length"
edgarallanpoe,"of body, and covered with a black wool. There were a great variety of"
edgarallanpoe,"tame fowls running about, and these seemed to constitute the chief food"
edgarallanpoe,of the natives. To our astonishment we saw black albatross among these
edgarallanpoe,"birds in a state of entire domestication, going to sea periodically"
edgarallanpoe,"for food, but always returning to the village as a home, and using the"
edgarallanpoe,southern shore in the vicinity as a place of incubation. There they were
edgarallanpoe,"joined by their friends the pelicans as usual, but these latter never"
edgarallanpoe,followed them to the dwellings of the savages. Among the other kinds of
edgarallanpoe,"tame fowls were ducks, differing very little from the canvass-back of"
edgarallanpoe,"our own country, black gannets, and a large bird not unlike the buzzard"
edgarallanpoe,"in appearance, but not carnivorous. Of fish there seemed to be a great"
edgarallanpoe,"abundance. We saw, during our visit, a quantity of dried salmon,"
edgarallanpoe,"rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel, blackfish, skate, conger eels,"
edgarallanpoe,"elephantfish, mullets, soles, parrotfish, leather-jackets, gurnards,"
edgarallanpoe,"hake, flounders, paracutas, and innumerable other varieties. We noticed,"
edgarallanpoe,"too, that most of them were similar to the fish about the group of Lord"
edgarallanpoe,"Auckland Islands, in a latitude as low as fifty-one degrees south. The"
edgarallanpoe,"Gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful. We saw but few wild animals,"
edgarallanpoe,"and none of a large size, or of a species with which we were familiar."
edgarallanpoe,"One or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed our path, but the"
edgarallanpoe,"natives paid them little attention, and we concluded that they were not"
edgarallanpoe,venomous.
edgarallanpoe,"As we approached the village with Too-wit and his party, a vast crowd of"
edgarallanpoe,"the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts, among which we could"
edgarallanpoe,only distinguish the everlasting Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! We were
edgarallanpoe,"much surprised at perceiving that, with one or two exceptions, these new"
edgarallanpoe,"comers were entirely naked, and skins being used only by the men of"
edgarallanpoe,the canoes. All the weapons of the country seemed also to be in the
edgarallanpoe,"possession of the latter, for there was no appearance of any among the"
edgarallanpoe,"villagers. There were a great many women and children, the former not"
edgarallanpoe,altogether wanting in what might be termed personal beauty. They were
edgarallanpoe,"straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of carriage"
edgarallanpoe,"not to be found in civilized society. Their lips, however, like those of"
edgarallanpoe,"the men, were thick and clumsy, so that, even when laughing, the teeth"
edgarallanpoe,were never disclosed. Their hair was of a finer texture than that of the
edgarallanpoe,males. Among these naked villagers there might have been ten or twelve
edgarallanpoe,"who were clothed, like the party of Too-wit, in dresses of black skin,"
edgarallanpoe,and armed with lances and heavy clubs. These appeared to have great
edgarallanpoe,"influence among the rest, and were always addressed by the title Wampoo."
edgarallanpoe,"These, too, were the tenants of the black skin palaces. That of Too-wit"
edgarallanpoe,"was situated in the centre of the village, and was much larger and"
edgarallanpoe,somewhat better constructed than others of its kind. The tree which
edgarallanpoe,formed its support was cut off at a distance of twelve feet or
edgarallanpoe,"thereabouts from the root, and there were several branches left just"
edgarallanpoe,"below the cut, these serving to extend the covering, and in this way"
edgarallanpoe,"prevent its flapping about the trunk. The covering, too, which consisted"
edgarallanpoe,"of four very large skins fastened together with wooden skewers, was"
edgarallanpoe,secured at the bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground.
edgarallanpoe,The floor was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet.
edgarallanpoe,"To this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many of the"
edgarallanpoe,natives crowded in after us as possible. Too-wit seated himself on the
edgarallanpoe,"leaves, and made signs that we should follow his example. This we did,"
edgarallanpoe,"and presently found ourselves in a situation peculiarly uncomfortable,"
edgarallanpoe,"if not indeed critical. We were on the ground, twelve in number, with"
edgarallanpoe,"the savages, as many as forty, sitting on their hams so closely"
edgarallanpoe,"around us that, if any disturbance had arisen, we should have found it"
edgarallanpoe,"impossible to make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen to our feet."
edgarallanpoe,"The pressure was not only inside the tent, but outside, where probably"
edgarallanpoe,"was every individual on the whole island, the crowd being prevented from"
edgarallanpoe,trampling us to death only by the incessant exertions and vociferations
edgarallanpoe,"of Too-wit. Our chief security lay, however, in the presence of Too-wit"
edgarallanpoe,"himself among us, and we resolved to stick by him closely, as the"
edgarallanpoe,"best chance of extricating ourselves from the dilemma, sacrificing him"
edgarallanpoe,immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design.
edgarallanpoe,"After some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when"
edgarallanpoe,"the chief addressed us in a speech of great length, and very nearly"
edgarallanpoe,"resembling the one delivered in the canoes, with the exception that the"
edgarallanpoe,Anamoo-moos! were now somewhat more strenuously insisted upon than the
edgarallanpoe,Lama-Lamas! We listened in profound silence until the conclusion of this
edgarallanpoe,"harangue, when Captain Guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal"
edgarallanpoe,"friendship and goodwill, concluding what he had to say by a present of"
edgarallanpoe,"several strings of blue beads and a knife. At the former the monarch,"
edgarallanpoe,"much to our surprise, turned up his nose with some expression of"
edgarallanpoe,"contempt, but the knife gave him the most unlimited satisfaction, and he"
edgarallanpoe,immediately ordered dinner. This was handed into the tent over the
edgarallanpoe,"heads of the attendants, and consisted of the palpitating entrails of a"
edgarallanpoe,"specialis of unknown animal, probably one of the slim-legged hogs which"
edgarallanpoe,we had observed in our approach to the village. Seeing us at a loss how
edgarallanpoe,"to proceed, he began, by way of setting us an example, to devour yard"
edgarallanpoe,"after yard of the enticing food, until we could positively stand it no"
edgarallanpoe,"longer, and evinced such manifest symptoms of rebellion of stomach as"
edgarallanpoe,inspired his majesty with a degree of astonishment only inferior to that
edgarallanpoe,"brought about by the looking-glasses. We declined, however, partaking of"
edgarallanpoe,"the delicacies before us, and endeavoured to make him understand that we"
edgarallanpoe,"had no appetite whatever, having just finished a hearty dejeuner."
edgarallanpoe,"When the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a series of"
edgarallanpoe,"cross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could devise, with a"
edgarallanpoe,"view of discovering what were the chief productions of the country, and"
edgarallanpoe,whether any of them might be turned to profit. At length he seemed to
edgarallanpoe,"have some idea of our meaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of"
edgarallanpoe,coast where he assured us the biche de mer (pointing to a specimen of
edgarallanpoe,that animal) was to be found in great abundance. We were glad of this
edgarallanpoe,"early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd,"
edgarallanpoe,"and signified our eagerness to proceed. We now left the tent, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"accompanied by the whole population of the village, followed the chief"
edgarallanpoe,"to the southeastern extremity of the island, nor far from the bay where"
edgarallanpoe,"our vessel lay at anchor. We waited here for about an hour, until the"
edgarallanpoe,four canoes were brought around by some of the savages to our station.
edgarallanpoe,"The whole of our party then getting into one of them, we were paddled"
edgarallanpoe,"along the edge of the reef before mentioned, and of another still"
edgarallanpoe,"farther out, where we saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than"
edgarallanpoe,the oldest seamen among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower
edgarallanpoe,latitudes most celebrated for this article of commerce. We stayed near
edgarallanpoe,these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could easily
edgarallanpoe,"load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we were taken"
edgarallanpoe,"alongside the schooner, and parted with Too-wit, after obtaining from"
edgarallanpoe,"him a promise that he would bring us, in the course of twenty-four"
edgarallanpoe,"hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks and Gallipago tortoises as his"
edgarallanpoe,canoes would hold. In the whole of this adventure we saw nothing in the
edgarallanpoe,"demeanour of the natives calculated to create suspicion, with the single"
edgarallanpoe,exception of the systematic manner in which their party was strengthened
edgarallanpoe,during our route from the schooner to the village.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 20
edgarallanpoe,"THE chief was as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully supplied"
edgarallanpoe,with fresh provisions. We found the tortoises as fine as we had ever
edgarallanpoe,"seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl, being"
edgarallanpoe,"exceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured. Besides these, the"
edgarallanpoe,"savages brought us, upon our making them comprehend our wishes, a vast"
edgarallanpoe,"quantity of brown celery and scurvy grass, with a canoe-load of fresh"
edgarallanpoe,"fish and some dried. The celery was a treat indeed, and the scurvy grass"
edgarallanpoe,proved of incalculable benefit in restoring those of our men who had
edgarallanpoe,shown symptoms of disease. In a very short time we had not a single
edgarallanpoe,person on the sick-list. We had also plenty of other kinds of fresh
edgarallanpoe,"provisions, among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish"
edgarallanpoe,"resembling the mussel in shape, but with the taste of an oyster."
edgarallanpoe,"Shrimps, too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds’"
edgarallanpoe,"eggs with dark shells. We took in, too, a plentiful stock of the flesh"
edgarallanpoe,of the hog which I have mentioned before. Most of the men found it a
edgarallanpoe,"palatable food, but I thought it fishy and otherwise disagreeable. In"
edgarallanpoe,"return for these good things we presented the natives with blue beads,"
edgarallanpoe,"brass trinkets, nails, knives, and pieces of red cloth, they being fully"
edgarallanpoe,"delighted in the exchange. We established a regular market on shore,"
edgarallanpoe,"just under the guns of the schooner, where our barterings were carried"
edgarallanpoe,"on with every appearance of good faith, and a degree of order which"
edgarallanpoe,their conduct at the village of _Klock-klock_ had not led us to expect
edgarallanpoe,from the savages.
edgarallanpoe,"Matters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which"
edgarallanpoe,"parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and"
edgarallanpoe,"parties of our men frequently on shore, making long excursions into the"
edgarallanpoe,"interior, and receiving no molestation whatever. Finding the ease with"
edgarallanpoe,"which the vessel might be loaded with _biche de mer_, owing to the"
edgarallanpoe,"friendly disposition of the islanders, and the readiness with which they"
edgarallanpoe,"would render us assistance in collecting it, Captain Guy resolved to"
edgarallanpoe,enter into negotiations with Too-wit for the erection of suitable houses
edgarallanpoe,"in which to cure the article, and for the services of himself and tribe"
edgarallanpoe,"in gathering as much as possible, while he himself took advantage of the"
edgarallanpoe,fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward. Upon mentioning
edgarallanpoe,this project to the chief he seemed very willing to enter into an
edgarallanpoe,"agreement. A bargain was accordingly struck, perfectly satisfactory to"
edgarallanpoe,"both parties, by which it was arranged that, after making the necessary"
edgarallanpoe,"preparations, such as laying off the proper grounds, erecting a portion"
edgarallanpoe,"of the buildings, and doing some other work in which the whole of"
edgarallanpoe,"our crew would be required, the schooner should proceed on her route,"
edgarallanpoe,leaving three of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of
edgarallanpoe,"the project, and instruct the natives in drying the _biche de mer_. In"
edgarallanpoe,"regard to terms, these were made to depend upon the exertions of the"
edgarallanpoe,savages in our absence. They were to receive a stipulated quantity of
edgarallanpoe,"blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so forth, for every certain number of"
edgarallanpoe,piculs of the _biche de mer_ which should be ready on our return.
edgarallanpoe,"A description of the nature of this important article of commerce, and"
edgarallanpoe,"the method of preparing it, may prove of some interest to my readers,"
edgarallanpoe,and I can find no more suitable place than this for introducing an
edgarallanpoe,account of it. The following comprehensive notice of the substance is
edgarallanpoe,taken from a modern history of a voyage to the South Seas.
edgarallanpoe,“It is that _mollusca_ from the Indian Seas which is known to commerce
edgarallanpoe,by the French name _bouche de mer_ (a nice morsel from the sea). If I
edgarallanpoe,"am not much mistaken, the celebrated Cuvier calls it _gasteropeda"
edgarallanpoe,pulmonifera_. It is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the Pacific
edgarallanpoe,"islands, and gathered especially for the Chinese market, where it"
edgarallanpoe,"commands a great price, perhaps as much as their much-talked-of edible"
edgarallanpoe,"birds’ nests, which are properly made up of the gelatinous matter picked"
edgarallanpoe,up by a species of swallow from the body of these molluscae. They have
edgarallanpoe,"no shell, no legs, nor any prominent part, except an _absorbing_ and"
edgarallanpoe,"an _excretory_, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like"
edgarallanpoe,"caterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which, when low,"
edgarallanpoe,"they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill of which, inserted"
edgarallanpoe,"in the soft animal, draws a gummy and filamentous substance, which, by"
edgarallanpoe,"drying, can be wrought into the solid walls of their nest. Hence the"
edgarallanpoe,name of _gasteropeda pulmonifera_.
edgarallanpoe,"“This mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to eighteen"
edgarallanpoe,inches in length; and I have seen a few that were not less than two feet
edgarallanpoe,"long. They were nearly round, a little flattish on one side, which lies"
edgarallanpoe,next to the bottom of the sea; and they are from one to eight inches
edgarallanpoe,thick. They crawl up into shallow water at particular seasons of the
edgarallanpoe,"year, probably for the purpose of gendering, as we often find them in"
edgarallanpoe,"pairs. It is when the sun has the most power on the water, rendering it"
edgarallanpoe,"tepid, that they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so"
edgarallanpoe,"shallow that, on the tide’s receding, they are left dry, exposed to"
edgarallanpoe,the beat of the sun. But they do not bring forth their young in shallow
edgarallanpoe,"water, as we never see any of their progeny, and full-grown ones are"
edgarallanpoe,always observed coming in from deep water. They feed principally on that
edgarallanpoe,class of zoophytes which produce the coral.
edgarallanpoe,“The _biche de mer_ is generally taken in three or four feet of water;
edgarallanpoe,"after which they are brought on shore, and split at one end with a"
edgarallanpoe,"knife, the incision being one inch or more, according to the size of the"
edgarallanpoe,"mollusca. Through this opening the entrails are forced out by pressure,"
edgarallanpoe,and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the deep. The
edgarallanpoe,"article is then washed, and afterward boiled to a certain degree, which"
edgarallanpoe,must not be too much or too little. They are then buried in the ground
edgarallanpoe,"for four hours, then boiled again for a short time, after which they are"
edgarallanpoe,"dried, either by the fire or the sun. Those cured by the sun are worth"
edgarallanpoe,"the most; but where one picul (133 1/3 lbs.) can be cured that way, I"
edgarallanpoe,"can cure thirty piculs by the fire. When once properly cured, they can"
edgarallanpoe,be kept in a dry place for two or three years without any risk; but they
edgarallanpoe,"should be examined once in every few months, say four times a year, to"
edgarallanpoe,see if any dampness is likely to affect them.
edgarallanpoe,"“The Chinese, as before stated, consider _biche de mer_ a very great"
edgarallanpoe,"luxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and nourishes the"
edgarallanpoe,"system, and renews the exhausted system of the immoderate voluptuary."
edgarallanpoe,"The first quality commands a high price in Canton, being worth ninety"
edgarallanpoe,"dollars a picul; the second quality, seventy-five dollars; the third,"
edgarallanpoe,"fifty dollars; the fourth, thirty dollars; the fifth, twenty dollars;"
edgarallanpoe,"the sixth, twelve dollars; the seventh, eight dollars; and the eighth,"
edgarallanpoe,"four dollars; small cargoes, however, will often bring more in Manilla,"
edgarallanpoe,"Singapore, and Batavia.”"
edgarallanpoe,"An agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded immediately to"
edgarallanpoe,land everything necessary for preparing the buildings and clearing
edgarallanpoe,the ground. A large flat space near the eastern shore of the bay was
edgarallanpoe,"selected, where there was plenty of both wood and water, and within a"
edgarallanpoe,convenient distance of the principal reefs on which the _biche de mer_
edgarallanpoe,"was to be procured. We now all set to work in good earnest, and soon, to"
edgarallanpoe,"the great astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient number of"
edgarallanpoe,"trees for our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the framework"
edgarallanpoe,"of the houses, which in two or three days were so far under way that"
edgarallanpoe,we could safely trust the rest of the work to the three men whom we
edgarallanpoe,"intended to leave behind. These were John Carson, Alfred Harris, and"
edgarallanpoe,"___ Peterson (all natives of London, I believe), who volunteered their"
edgarallanpoe,services in this respect.
edgarallanpoe,By the last of the month we had everything in readiness for departure.
edgarallanpoe,"We had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of leave-taking to the"
edgarallanpoe,"village, and Too-wit insisted so pertinaciously upon our keeping the"
edgarallanpoe,promise that we did not think it advisable to run the risk of offending
edgarallanpoe,him by a final refusal. I believe that not one of us had at this time
edgarallanpoe,the slightest suspicion of the good faith of the savages. They had
edgarallanpoe,"uniformly behaved with the greatest decorum, aiding us with alacrity in"
edgarallanpoe,"our work, offering us their commodities, frequently without price, and"
edgarallanpoe,"never, in any instance, pilfering a single article, although the"
edgarallanpoe,high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident by the
edgarallanpoe,extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon our making them
edgarallanpoe,"a present. The women especially were most obliging in every respect,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, upon the whole, we should have been the most suspicious of human"
edgarallanpoe,beings had we entertained a single thought of perfidy on the part of a
edgarallanpoe,people who treated us so well. A very short while sufficed to prove that
edgarallanpoe,this apparent kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply
edgarallanpoe,"laid plan for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom we"
edgarallanpoe,"entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem, were among the most"
edgarallanpoe,"barbarous, subtle, and bloodthirsty wretches that ever contaminated the"
edgarallanpoe,face of the globe.
edgarallanpoe,It was on the first of February that we went on shore for the purpose of
edgarallanpoe,"visiting the village. Although, as said before, we entertained not the"
edgarallanpoe,"slightest suspicion, still no proper precaution was neglected. Six"
edgarallanpoe,"men were left in the schooner, with instructions to permit none of the"
edgarallanpoe,"savages to approach the vessel during our absence, under any pretence"
edgarallanpoe,"whatever, and to remain constantly on deck. The boarding-nettings were"
edgarallanpoe,"up, the guns double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels"
edgarallanpoe,"loaded with canisters of musket-balls. She lay, with her anchor apeak,"
edgarallanpoe,"about a mile from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in any"
edgarallanpoe,direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the full fire of
edgarallanpoe,our swivels immediately.
edgarallanpoe,"The six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of thirty-two"
edgarallanpoe,"persons in all. We were armed to the teeth, having with us muskets,"
edgarallanpoe,"pistols, and cutlasses; besides, each had a long kind of seaman’s knife,"
edgarallanpoe,somewhat resembling the bowie knife now so much used throughout our
edgarallanpoe,western and southern country. A hundred of the black skin warriors met
edgarallanpoe,us at the landing for the purpose of accompanying us on our way. We
edgarallanpoe,"noticed, however, with some surprise, that they were now entirely"
edgarallanpoe,"without arms; and, upon questioning Too-wit in relation to this"
edgarallanpoe,"circumstance, he merely answered that _Mattee non we pa pa si_--meaning"
edgarallanpoe,that there was no need of arms where all were brothers. We took this in
edgarallanpoe,"good part, and proceeded."
edgarallanpoe,"We had passed the spring and rivulet of which I before spoke, and were"
edgarallanpoe,now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain of soapstone
edgarallanpoe,hills among which the village was situated. This gorge was very
edgarallanpoe,"rocky and uneven, so much so that it was with no little difficulty we"
edgarallanpoe,scrambled through it on our first visit to Klock-klock. The whole length
edgarallanpoe,"of the ravine might have been a mile and a half, or probably two"
edgarallanpoe,miles. It wound in every possible direction through the hills (having
edgarallanpoe,"apparently formed, at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no"
edgarallanpoe,instance proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn. The
edgarallanpoe,"sides of this dell would have averaged, I am sure, seventy or eighty"
edgarallanpoe,"feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of their extent, and"
edgarallanpoe,"in some portions they arose to an astonishing height, overshadowing the"
edgarallanpoe,pass so completely that but little of the light of day could penetrate.
edgarallanpoe,"The general width was about forty feet, and occasionally it diminished"
edgarallanpoe,so as not to allow the passage of more than five or six persons abreast.
edgarallanpoe,"In short, there could be no place in the world better adapted for the"
edgarallanpoe,"consummation of an ambuscade, and it was no more than natural that we"
edgarallanpoe,should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it. When I now
edgarallanpoe,"think of our egregious folly, the chief subject of astonishment seems"
edgarallanpoe,"to be, that we should have ever ventured, under any circumstances, so"
edgarallanpoe,completely into the power of unknown savages as to permit them to march
edgarallanpoe,both before and behind us in our progress through this ravine. Yet such
edgarallanpoe,"was the order we blindly took up, trusting foolishly to the force of"
edgarallanpoe,"our party, the unarmed condition of Too-wit and his men, the certain"
edgarallanpoe,"efficacy of our firearms (whose effect was yet a secret to the natives),"
edgarallanpoe,"and, more than all, to the long-sustained pretension of friendship kept"
edgarallanpoe,"up by these infamous wretches. Five or six of them went on before, as"
edgarallanpoe,"if to lead the way, ostentatiously busying themselves in removing the"
edgarallanpoe,larger stones and rubbish from the path. Next came our own party. We
edgarallanpoe,"walked closely together, taking care only to prevent separation. Behind"
edgarallanpoe,"followed the main body of the savages, observing unusual order and"
edgarallanpoe,decorum.
edgarallanpoe,"Dirk Peters, a man named Wilson Allen, and myself were on the right of"
edgarallanpoe,"our companions, examining, as we went along, the singular stratification"
edgarallanpoe,of the precipice which overhung us. A fissure in the soft rock attracted
edgarallanpoe,our attention. It was about wide enough for one person to enter without
edgarallanpoe,"squeezing, and extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet"
edgarallanpoe,"in a straight course, sloping afterward to the left. The height of the"
edgarallanpoe,"opening, is far as we could see into it from the main gorge, was perhaps"
edgarallanpoe,sixty or seventy feet. There were one or two stunted shrubs growing from
edgarallanpoe,"the crevices, bearing a species of filbert which I felt some curiosity"
edgarallanpoe,"to examine, and pushed in briskly for that purpose, gathering five or"
edgarallanpoe,"six of the nuts at a grasp, and then hastily retreating. As I turned, I"
edgarallanpoe,"found that Peters and Allen had followed me. I desired them to go back,"
edgarallanpoe,"as there was not room for two persons to pass, saying they should have"
edgarallanpoe,"some of my nuts. They accordingly turned, and were scrambling back,"
edgarallanpoe,"Allen being close to the mouth of the fissure, when I was suddenly aware"
edgarallanpoe,"of a concussion resembling nothing I had ever before experienced, and"
edgarallanpoe,"which impressed me with a vague conception, if indeed I then thought of"
edgarallanpoe,"anything, that the whole foundations of the solid globe were suddenly"
edgarallanpoe,"rent asunder, and that the day of universal dissolution was at hand."
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 21
edgarallanpoe,"AS soon as I could collect my scattered senses, I found myself nearly"
edgarallanpoe,"suffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a quantity of loose"
edgarallanpoe,"earth, which was also falling upon me heavily in every direction,"
edgarallanpoe,"threatening to bury me entirely. Horribly alarmed at this idea, I"
edgarallanpoe,"struggled to gain my feet, and at last succeeded. I then remained"
edgarallanpoe,"motionless for some moments, endeavouring to conceive what had happened"
edgarallanpoe,"to me, and where I was. Presently I heard a deep groan just at my ear,"
edgarallanpoe,and afterward the smothered voice of Peters calling to me for aid in the
edgarallanpoe,"name of God. I scrambled one or two paces forward, when I fell directly"
edgarallanpoe,"over the head and shoulders of my companion, who, I soon discovered,"
edgarallanpoe,"was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his middle, and struggling"
edgarallanpoe,desperately to free himself from the pressure. I tore the dirt from
edgarallanpoe,"around him with all the energy I could command, and at length succeeded"
edgarallanpoe,in getting him out.
edgarallanpoe,As soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise to be
edgarallanpoe,"capable of conversing rationally, we both came to the conclusion"
edgarallanpoe,"that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured had, by some"
edgarallanpoe,"convulsion of nature, or probably from their own weight, caved in"
edgarallanpoe,"overhead, and that we were consequently lost for ever, being thus"
edgarallanpoe,entombed alive. For a long time we gave up supinely to the most intense
edgarallanpoe,"agony and despair, such as cannot be adequately imagined by those"
edgarallanpoe,who have never been in a similar position. I firmly believed that no
edgarallanpoe,incident ever occurring in the course of human events is more adapted to
edgarallanpoe,inspire the supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like
edgarallanpoe,"our own, of living inhumation. The blackness of darkness which envelops"
edgarallanpoe,"the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the stifling fumes from"
edgarallanpoe,"the damp earth, unite with the ghastly considerations that we are beyond"
edgarallanpoe,"the remotest confines of hope, and that such is the allotted portion of"
edgarallanpoe,"the dead, to carry into the human heart a degree of appalling awe and"
edgarallanpoe,horror not to be tolerated--never to be conceived.
edgarallanpoe,At length Peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain
edgarallanpoe,"precisely the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison; it"
edgarallanpoe,"being barely possible, he observed, that some opening might yet be left"
edgarallanpoe,"us for escape. I caught eagerly at this hope, and, arousing myself to"
edgarallanpoe,"exertion, attempted to force my way through the loose earth. Hardly had"
edgarallanpoe,"I advanced a single step before a glimmer of light became perceptible,"
edgarallanpoe,"enough to convince me that, at all events, we should not immediately"
edgarallanpoe,"perish for want of air. We now took some degree of heart, and encouraged"
edgarallanpoe,each other to hope for the best. Having scrambled over a bank of rubbish
edgarallanpoe,"which impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light, we"
edgarallanpoe,found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some relief from
edgarallanpoe,the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented us. Presently we
edgarallanpoe,"were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects around, and discovered"
edgarallanpoe,"that we were near the extremity of the straight portion of the fissure,"
edgarallanpoe,"where it made a turn to the left. A few struggles more, and we reached"
edgarallanpoe,"the bend, when to our inexpressible joy, there appeared a long seam or"
edgarallanpoe,"crack extending upward a vast distance, generally at an angle of about"
edgarallanpoe,"forty-five degrees, although sometimes much more precipitous. We could"
edgarallanpoe,"not see through the whole extent of this opening; but, as a good deal of"
edgarallanpoe,"light came down it, we had little doubt of finding at the top of it (if"
edgarallanpoe,we could by any means reach the top) a clear passage into the open air.
edgarallanpoe,I now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure from
edgarallanpoe,"the main gorge, and that our companion, Allen, was still missing; we"
edgarallanpoe,determined at once to retrace our steps and look for him. After a long
edgarallanpoe,"search, and much danger from the farther caving in of the earth above"
edgarallanpoe,"us, Peters at length cried out to me that he had hold of our companion’s"
edgarallanpoe,"foot, and that his whole body was deeply buried beneath the rubbish"
edgarallanpoe,beyond the possibility of extricating him. I soon found that what he
edgarallanpoe,"said was too true, and that, of course, life had been long extinct. With"
edgarallanpoe,"sorrowful hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its fate, and again"
edgarallanpoe,made our way to the bend.
edgarallanpoe,"The breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and, after"
edgarallanpoe,"one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once more to"
edgarallanpoe,despair. I have before said that the chain of hills through which
edgarallanpoe,ran the main gorge was composed of a species of soft rock resembling
edgarallanpoe,soapstone. The sides of the cleft we were now attempting to ascend were
edgarallanpoe,"of the same material, and so excessively slippery, being wet, that we"
edgarallanpoe,could get but little foothold upon them even in their least precipitous
edgarallanpoe,"parts; in some places, where the ascent was nearly perpendicular, the"
edgarallanpoe,"difficulty was, of course, much aggravated; and, indeed, for some time"
edgarallanpoe,"we thought insurmountable. We took courage, however, from despair, and"
edgarallanpoe,"what, by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our bowie knives,"
edgarallanpoe,"and swinging at the risk of our lives, to small projecting points of"
edgarallanpoe,a harder species of slaty rock which now and then protruded from the
edgarallanpoe,"general mass, we at length reached a natural platform, from which was"
edgarallanpoe,"perceptible a patch of blue sky, at the extremity of a thickly-wooded"
edgarallanpoe,"ravine. Looking back now, with somewhat more leisure, at the passage"
edgarallanpoe,"through which we had thus far proceeded, we clearly saw from the"
edgarallanpoe,"appearance of its sides, that it was of late formation, and we concluded"
edgarallanpoe,"that the concussion, whatever it was, which had so unexpectedly"
edgarallanpoe,"overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open this path for"
edgarallanpoe,"escape. Being quite exhausted with exertion, and indeed, so weak that we"
edgarallanpoe,"were scarcely able to stand or articulate, Peters now proposed that we"
edgarallanpoe,should endeavour to bring our companions to the rescue by firing the
edgarallanpoe,pistols which still remained in our girdles--the muskets as well as
edgarallanpoe,cutlasses had been lost among the loose earth at the bottom of the
edgarallanpoe,"chasm. Subsequent events proved that, had we fired, we should have"
edgarallanpoe,"sorely repented it, but luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by"
edgarallanpoe,"this time arisen in my mind, and we forbore to let the savages know of"
edgarallanpoe,our whereabouts.
edgarallanpoe,"After having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up the"
edgarallanpoe,"ravine, and had gone no great way before we heard a succession of"
edgarallanpoe,tremendous yells. At length we reached what might be called the surface
edgarallanpoe,"of the ground; for our path hitherto, since leaving the platform, had"
edgarallanpoe,"lain beneath an archway of high rock and foliage, at a vast distance"
edgarallanpoe,"overhead. With great caution we stole to a narrow opening, through which"
edgarallanpoe,"we had a clear sight of the surrounding country, when the whole dreadful"
edgarallanpoe,secret of the concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view.
edgarallanpoe,The spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the highest
edgarallanpoe,peak in the range of the soapstone hills. The gorge in which our party
edgarallanpoe,"of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet to the left of us. But,"
edgarallanpoe,"for at least one hundred yards, the channel or bed of this gorge was"
edgarallanpoe,entirely filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of
edgarallanpoe,earth and stone that had been artificially tumbled within it. The means
edgarallanpoe,by which the vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than
edgarallanpoe,"evident, for sure traces of the murderous work were yet remaining. In"
edgarallanpoe,several spots along the top of the eastern side of the gorge (we were
edgarallanpoe,now on the western) might be seen stakes of wood driven into the earth.
edgarallanpoe,"In these spots the earth had not given way, but throughout the whole"
edgarallanpoe,"extent of the face of the precipice from which the mass had fallen,"
edgarallanpoe,"it was clear, from marks left in the soil resembling those made by the"
edgarallanpoe,"drill of the rock blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing"
edgarallanpoe,"had been inserted, at not more than a yard apart, for the length of"
edgarallanpoe,"perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten feet back from the"
edgarallanpoe,edge of the gulf. Strong cords of grape vine were attached to the stakes
edgarallanpoe,"still remaining on the hill, and it was evident that such cords had also"
edgarallanpoe,been attached to each of the other stakes. I have already spoken of the
edgarallanpoe,singular stratification of these soapstone hills; and the description
edgarallanpoe,just given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected our
edgarallanpoe,escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of its nature.
edgarallanpoe,This was such that almost every natural convulsion would be sure to
edgarallanpoe,split the soil into perpendicular layers or ridges running parallel with
edgarallanpoe,"one another, and a very moderate exertion of art would be sufficient"
edgarallanpoe,for effecting the same purpose. Of this stratification the savages had
edgarallanpoe,availed themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends. There can be no
edgarallanpoe,"doubt that, by the continuous line of stakes, a partial rupture of the"
edgarallanpoe,"soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one or two feet,"
edgarallanpoe,when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each of the cords (these
edgarallanpoe,"cords being attached to the tops of the stakes, and extending back from"
edgarallanpoe,"the edge of the cliff), a vast leverage power was obtained, capable of"
edgarallanpoe,"hurling the whole face of the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom"
edgarallanpoe,of the abyss below. The fate of our poor companions was no longer a
edgarallanpoe,matter of uncertainty. We alone had escaped from the tempest of that
edgarallanpoe,overwhelming destruction. We were the only living white men upon the
edgarallanpoe,island.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 22
edgarallanpoe,"OUR situation, as it now appeared, was scarcely less dreadful than"
edgarallanpoe,when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever. We saw before us no
edgarallanpoe,"prospect but that of being put to death by the savages, or of dragging"
edgarallanpoe,"out a miserable existence in captivity among them. We might, to be sure,"
edgarallanpoe,conceal ourselves for a time from their observation among the fastnesses
edgarallanpoe,"of the hills, and, as a final resort, in the chasm from which we had"
edgarallanpoe,just issued; but we must either perish in the long polar winter through
edgarallanpoe,"cold and famine, or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain"
edgarallanpoe,relief.
edgarallanpoe,"The whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages, crowds"
edgarallanpoe,"of whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands to the"
edgarallanpoe,"southward on flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending their aid"
edgarallanpoe,in the capture and plunder of the Jane. The vessel still lay calmly at
edgarallanpoe,"anchor in the bay, those on board being apparently quite unconscious of"
edgarallanpoe,any danger awaiting them. How we longed at that moment to be with them!
edgarallanpoe,"either to aid in effecting their escape, or to perish with them in"
edgarallanpoe,attempting a defence. We saw no chance even of warning them of their
edgarallanpoe,"danger without bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with"
edgarallanpoe,but a remote hope of benefit to them. A pistol fired might suffice to
edgarallanpoe,apprise them that something wrong had occurred; but the report could not
edgarallanpoe,possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety lay in getting
edgarallanpoe,out of the harbour forthwith--it could not tell them that no principles
edgarallanpoe,"of honour now bound them to remain, that their companions were no longer"
edgarallanpoe,among the living. Upon hearing the discharge they could not be more
edgarallanpoe,"thoroughly prepared to meet the foe, who were now getting ready to"
edgarallanpoe,"attack, than they already were, and always had been. No good, therefore,"
edgarallanpoe,"and infinite harm, would result from our firing, and after mature"
edgarallanpoe,"deliberation, we forbore."
edgarallanpoe,"Our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel, to seize one"
edgarallanpoe,"of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay, and endeavour to"
edgarallanpoe,force a passage on board. But the utter impossibility of succeeding in
edgarallanpoe,"this desperate task soon became evident. The country, as I said before,"
edgarallanpoe,"was literally swarming with the natives, skulking among the bushes and"
edgarallanpoe,"recesses of the hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner. In"
edgarallanpoe,"our immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by which"
edgarallanpoe,we could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were stationed the
edgarallanpoe,"whole party of the black skin warriors, with Too-wit at their head, and"
edgarallanpoe,apparently only waiting for some re-enforcement to commence his onset
edgarallanpoe,"upon the Jane. The canoes, too, which lay at the head of the bay, were"
edgarallanpoe,"manned with savages, unarmed, it is true, but who undoubtedly had arms"
edgarallanpoe,"within reach. We were forced, therefore, however unwillingly, to remain"
edgarallanpoe,"in our place of concealment, mere spectators of the conflict which"
edgarallanpoe,presently ensued.
edgarallanpoe,"In about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or flatboats,"
edgarallanpoe,"without riggers, filled with savages, and coming round the southern"
edgarallanpoe,"bight of the harbor. They appeared to have no arms except short clubs,"
edgarallanpoe,and stones which lay in the bottom of the rafts. Immediately afterward
edgarallanpoe,"another detachment, still larger, appeared in an opposite direction, and"
edgarallanpoe,"with similar weapons. The four canoes, too, were now quickly filled with"
edgarallanpoe,"natives, starting up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and put off"
edgarallanpoe,"swiftly to join the other parties. Thus, in less time than I have taken"
edgarallanpoe,"to tell it, and as if by magic, the Jane saw herself surrounded by an"
edgarallanpoe,immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing her at
edgarallanpoe,all hazards.
edgarallanpoe,That they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an instant.
edgarallanpoe,"The six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they might engage"
edgarallanpoe,"in her defence, were altogether unequal to the proper management of the"
edgarallanpoe,"guns, or in any manner to sustain a contest at such odds. I could"
edgarallanpoe,"hardly imagine that they would make resistance at all, but in this was"
edgarallanpoe,"deceived; for presently I saw them get springs upon the cable, and bring"
edgarallanpoe,"the vessel’s starboard broadside to bear upon the canoes, which by this"
edgarallanpoe,"time were within pistol range, the rafts being nearly a quarter of a"
edgarallanpoe,"mile to windward. Owing to some cause unknown, but most probably to"
edgarallanpoe,the agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless a
edgarallanpoe,"situation, the discharge was an entire failure. Not a canoe was hit or"
edgarallanpoe,"a single savage injured, the shots striking short and ricocheting over"
edgarallanpoe,their heads. The only effect produced upon them was astonishment at
edgarallanpoe,"the unexpected report and smoke, which was so excessive that for some"
edgarallanpoe,"moments I almost thought they would abandon their design entirely, and"
edgarallanpoe,return to the shore. And this they would most likely have done had our
edgarallanpoe,"men followed up their broadside by a discharge of small arms, in which,"
edgarallanpoe,"as the canoes were now so near at hand, they could not have failed in"
edgarallanpoe,"doing some execution, sufficient, at least, to deter this party from a"
edgarallanpoe,"farther advance, until they could have given the rafts also a broadside."
edgarallanpoe,"But, in place of this, they left the canoe party to recover from their"
edgarallanpoe,"panic, and, by looking about them, to see that no injury had been"
edgarallanpoe,"sustained, while they flew to the larboard to get ready for the rafts."
edgarallanpoe,The discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect. The star
edgarallanpoe,and double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight of the rafts
edgarallanpoe,"completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or forty of the savages"
edgarallanpoe,"outright, while a hundred of them, at least, were thrown into the water,"
edgarallanpoe,"the most of them dreadfully wounded. The remainder, frightened out of"
edgarallanpoe,"their senses, commenced at once a precipitate retreat, not even waiting"
edgarallanpoe,"to pick up their maimed companions, who were swimming about in every"
edgarallanpoe,"direction, screaming and yelling for aid. This great success, however,"
edgarallanpoe,came too late for the salvation of our devoted people. The canoe party
edgarallanpoe,were already on board the schooner to the number of more than a hundred
edgarallanpoe,"and fifty, the most of them having succeeded in scrambling up the chains"
edgarallanpoe,and over the boarding-netting even before the matches had been applied
edgarallanpoe,to the larboard guns. Nothing now could withstand their brute rage.
edgarallanpoe,"Our men were borne down at once, overwhelmed, trodden under foot, and"
edgarallanpoe,absolutely torn to pieces in an instant.
edgarallanpoe,"Seeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their fears,"
edgarallanpoe,and came up in shoals to the plunder. In five minutes the Jane was a
edgarallanpoe,pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage. The decks were
edgarallanpoe,"split open and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and everything movable on"
edgarallanpoe,"deck demolished as if by magic, while, by dint of pushing at the stern,"
edgarallanpoe,"towing with the canoes, and hauling at the sides, as they swam in"
edgarallanpoe,"thousands around the vessel, the wretches finally forced her on shore"
edgarallanpoe,"(the cable having been slipped), and delivered her over to the good"
edgarallanpoe,"offices of Too-wit, who, during the whole of the engagement,"
edgarallanpoe,"had maintained, like a skilful general, his post of security and"
edgarallanpoe,"reconnaissance among the hills, but, now that the victory was completed"
edgarallanpoe,"to his satisfaction, condescended to scamper down with his warriors of"
edgarallanpoe,"the black skin, and become a partaker in the spoils."
edgarallanpoe,Too-wit’s descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and
edgarallanpoe,reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm. At about fifty yards
edgarallanpoe,"from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at which we slaked"
edgarallanpoe,the burning thirst that now consumed us. Not far from the spring we
edgarallanpoe,discovered several of the filbert-bushes which I mentioned before. Upon
edgarallanpoe,"tasting the nuts we found them palatable, and very nearly resembling"
edgarallanpoe,in flavour the common English filbert. We collected our hats full
edgarallanpoe,"immediately, deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more."
edgarallanpoe,"While we were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the"
edgarallanpoe,"bushes alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our"
edgarallanpoe,"covert, when a large black bird of the bittern species strugglingly and"
edgarallanpoe,slowly arose above the shrubs. I was so much startled that I could do
edgarallanpoe,"nothing, but Peters had sufficient presence of mind to run up to it"
edgarallanpoe,"before it could make its escape, and seize it by the neck. Its struggles"
edgarallanpoe,"and screams were tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting it go, lest"
edgarallanpoe,the noise should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in
edgarallanpoe,"the neighbourhood. A stab with a bowie knife, however, at length brought"
edgarallanpoe,"it to the ground, and we dragged it into the ravine, congratulating"
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves that, at all events, we had thus obtained a supply of food"
edgarallanpoe,enough to last us for a week.
edgarallanpoe,"We now went out again to look about us, and ventured a considerable"
edgarallanpoe,"distance down the southern declivity of the hill, but met with nothing"
edgarallanpoe,else which could serve us for food. We therefore collected a quantity of
edgarallanpoe,"dry wood and returned, seeing one or two large parties of the natives on"
edgarallanpoe,"their way to the village, laden with the plunder of the vessel, and who,"
edgarallanpoe,"we were apprehensive, might discover us in passing beneath the hill."
edgarallanpoe,Our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as
edgarallanpoe,"possible, and with this object, we arranged some brushwood over the"
edgarallanpoe,aperture which I have before spoken of as the one through which we saw
edgarallanpoe,"the patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from the interior of the"
edgarallanpoe,chasm. We left only a very small opening just wide enough to admit of
edgarallanpoe,"our seeing the bay, without the risk of being discovered from below."
edgarallanpoe,"Having done this, we congratulated ourselves upon the security of the"
edgarallanpoe,"position; for we were now completely excluded from observation, as long"
edgarallanpoe,"as we chose to remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out upon"
edgarallanpoe,"the hill, We could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been"
edgarallanpoe,"within this hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the"
edgarallanpoe,probability that the fissure through which we attained it had been only
edgarallanpoe,"just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite, and that no other"
edgarallanpoe,"way of attaining it could be perceived, we were not so much rejoiced"
edgarallanpoe,at the thought of being secure from molestation as fearful lest there
edgarallanpoe,should be absolutely no means left us for descent. We resolved to
edgarallanpoe,"explore the summit of the hill thoroughly, when a good opportunity"
edgarallanpoe,should offer. In the meantime we watched the motions of the savages
edgarallanpoe,through our loophole.
edgarallanpoe,"They had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were now"
edgarallanpoe,preparing to set her on fire. In a little while we saw the smoke
edgarallanpoe,"ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway, and, shortly"
edgarallanpoe,"afterward, a dense mass of flame burst up from the forecastle. The"
edgarallanpoe,"rigging, masts and what remained of the sails caught immediately, and"
edgarallanpoe,the fire spread rapidly along the decks. Still a great many of the
edgarallanpoe,"savages retained their stations about her, hammering with large stones,"
edgarallanpoe,"axes, and cannon balls at the bolts and other iron and copper work. On"
edgarallanpoe,"the beach, and in canoes and rafts, there were not less, altogether,"
edgarallanpoe,"in the immediate vicinity of the schooner, than ten thousand natives,"
edgarallanpoe,"besides the shoals of them who, laden with booty, were making their"
edgarallanpoe,way inland and over to the neighbouring islands. We now anticipated a
edgarallanpoe,"catastrophe, and were not disappointed. First of all there came a smart"
edgarallanpoe,shock (which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we had been
edgarallanpoe,"slightly galvanized), but unattended with any visible signs of an"
edgarallanpoe,"explosion. The savages were evidently startled, and paused for an"
edgarallanpoe,instant from their labours and yellings. They were upon the point of
edgarallanpoe,"recommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke puffed up from the decks,"
edgarallanpoe,"resembling a black and heavy thundercloud--then, as if from its bowels,"
edgarallanpoe,"arose a tall stream of vivid fire to the height, apparently, of a"
edgarallanpoe,quarter of a mile--then there came a sudden circular expansion of the
edgarallanpoe,"flame--then the whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a single"
edgarallanpoe,"instant, with a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs--and,"
edgarallanpoe,"lastly, came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us"
edgarallanpoe,"impetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed the"
edgarallanpoe,"tumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the ruins"
edgarallanpoe,tumbled headlong in every direction around us.
edgarallanpoe,"The havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation, and"
edgarallanpoe,"they had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of their"
edgarallanpoe,"treachery. Perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion, while at least"
edgarallanpoe,an equal number were desperately mangled. The whole surface of the bay
edgarallanpoe,"was literally strewn with the struggling and drowning wretches, and"
edgarallanpoe,on shore matters were even worse. They seemed utterly appalled by the
edgarallanpoe,"suddenness and completeness of their discomfiture, and made no efforts"
edgarallanpoe,at assisting one another. At length we observed a total change in their
edgarallanpoe,"demeanour. From absolute stupor, they appeared to be, all at once,"
edgarallanpoe,"aroused to the highest pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about,"
edgarallanpoe,"going to and from a certain point on the beach, with the strangest"
edgarallanpoe,"expressions of mingled horror, rage, and intense curiosity depicted"
edgarallanpoe,"on their countenances, and shouting, at the top of their voices,"
edgarallanpoe,“Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”
edgarallanpoe,"Presently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they"
edgarallanpoe,"returned in a short time, carrying stakes of wood. These they brought to"
edgarallanpoe,"the station where the crowd was the thickest, which now separated so as"
edgarallanpoe,to afford us a view of the object of all this excitement. We perceived
edgarallanpoe,"something white lying upon the ground, but could not immediately make"
edgarallanpoe,out what it was. At length we saw that it was the carcass of the strange
edgarallanpoe,animal with the scarlet teeth and claws which the schooner had picked
edgarallanpoe,up at sea on the eighteenth of January. Captain Guy had had the body
edgarallanpoe,preserved for the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to England.
edgarallanpoe,I remember he had given some directions about it just before our making
edgarallanpoe,"the island, and it had been brought into the cabin and stowed away in"
edgarallanpoe,one of the lockers. It had now been thrown on shore by the explosion;
edgarallanpoe,but why it had occasioned so much concern among the savages was more
edgarallanpoe,than we could comprehend. Although they crowded around the carcass at
edgarallanpoe,"a little distance, none of them seemed willing to approach it closely."
edgarallanpoe,"By-and-by the men with the stakes drove them in a circle around it, and"
edgarallanpoe,"no sooner was this arrangement completed, than the whole of the vast"
edgarallanpoe,"assemblage rushed into the interior of the island, with loud screams of"
edgarallanpoe,“Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 23
edgarallanpoe,DURING the six or seven days immediately following we remained in our
edgarallanpoe,"hiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and then with"
edgarallanpoe,"the greatest precaution, for water and filberts. We had made a kind of"
edgarallanpoe,"penthouse on the platform, furnishing it with a bed of dry leaves,"
edgarallanpoe,"and placing in it three large flat stones, which served us for both"
edgarallanpoe,fireplace and table. We kindled a fire without difficulty by rubbing two
edgarallanpoe,"pieces of dry wood together, the one soft, the other hard. The bird we"
edgarallanpoe,"had taken in such good season proved excellent eating, although somewhat"
edgarallanpoe,"tough. It was not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern, with jet"
edgarallanpoe,"black and grizzly plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion to its"
edgarallanpoe,bulk. We afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the
edgarallanpoe,"ravine, apparently seeking for the one we had captured; but, as they"
edgarallanpoe,"never alighted, we had no opportunity of catching them."
edgarallanpoe,"As long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our situation, but"
edgarallanpoe,"it was now entirely consumed, and it became absolutely necessary that"
edgarallanpoe,we should look out for provision. The filberts would not satisfy the
edgarallanpoe,"cravings of hunger, afflicting us, too, with severe gripings of the"
edgarallanpoe,"bowels, and, if freely indulged in, with violent headache. We had seen"
edgarallanpoe,"several large tortoises near the seashore to the eastward of the hill,"
edgarallanpoe,"and perceived they might be easily taken, if we could get at them"
edgarallanpoe,"without the observation of the natives. It was resolved, therefore, to"
edgarallanpoe,make an attempt at descending.
edgarallanpoe,"We commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed to offer"
edgarallanpoe,"the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred yards before"
edgarallanpoe,(as we had anticipated from appearances on the hilltop) our progress was
edgarallanpoe,entirely arrested by a branch of the gorge in which our companions had
edgarallanpoe,perished. We now passed along the edge of this for about a quarter of a
edgarallanpoe,"mile, when we were again stopped by a precipice of immense depth, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"not being able to make our way along the brink of it, we were forced to"
edgarallanpoe,retrace our steps by the main ravine.
edgarallanpoe,"We now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar fortune."
edgarallanpoe,"After an hour’s scramble, at the risk of breaking our necks, we"
edgarallanpoe,discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit of black
edgarallanpoe,"granite, with fine dust at the bottom, and whence the only egress was by"
edgarallanpoe,"the rugged path in which we had come down. Toiling again up this path,"
edgarallanpoe,we now tried the northern edge of the hill. Here we were obliged to
edgarallanpoe,"use the greatest possible caution in our maneuvers, as the least"
edgarallanpoe,indiscretion would expose us to the full view of the savages in the
edgarallanpoe,"village. We crawled along, therefore, on our hands and knees, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"occasionally, were even forced to throw ourselves at full length,"
edgarallanpoe,dragging our bodies along by means of the shrubbery. In this careful
edgarallanpoe,"manner we had proceeded but a little way, when we arrived at a chasm"
edgarallanpoe,"far deeper than any we had yet seen, and leading directly into the main"
edgarallanpoe,"gorge. Thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we found ourselves cut"
edgarallanpoe,off entirely from access to the world below. Thoroughly exhausted by
edgarallanpoe,"our exertions, we made the best of our way back to the platform, and"
edgarallanpoe,"throwing ourselves upon the bed of leaves, slept sweetly and soundly for"
edgarallanpoe,some hours.
edgarallanpoe,For several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in
edgarallanpoe,"exploring every part of the summit of the hill, in order to inform"
edgarallanpoe,ourselves of its actual resources. We found that it would afford us no
edgarallanpoe,"food, with the exception of the unwholesome filberts, and a rank species"
edgarallanpoe,"of scurvy grass, which grew in a little patch of not more than four rods"
edgarallanpoe,"square, and would be soon exhausted. On the fifteenth of February, as"
edgarallanpoe,"near as I can remember, there was not a blade of this left, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"nuts were growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more"
edgarallanpoe,lamentable. {*5} On the sixteenth we again went round the walls of our
edgarallanpoe,"prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape; but to no purpose."
edgarallanpoe,"We also descended the chasm in which we had been overwhelmed, with the"
edgarallanpoe,"faint expectation of discovering, through this channel, some opening to"
edgarallanpoe,"the main ravine. Here, too, we were disappointed, although we found and"
edgarallanpoe,brought up with us a musket.
edgarallanpoe,On the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining more
edgarallanpoe,thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in
edgarallanpoe,the first search. We remembered that one of the fissures in the sides
edgarallanpoe,"of this pit had been but partially looked into, and we were anxious"
edgarallanpoe,"to explore it, although with no expectation of discovering here any"
edgarallanpoe,opening.
edgarallanpoe,We found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow as
edgarallanpoe,"before, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some attention."
edgarallanpoe,"It was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking places imaginable, and"
edgarallanpoe,we could scarcely bring ourselves to believe it altogether the work of
edgarallanpoe,"nature. The pit, from its eastern to its western extremity, was about"
edgarallanpoe,"five hundred yards in length, when all its windings were threaded; the"
edgarallanpoe,distance from east to west in a straight line not being more (I should
edgarallanpoe,"suppose, having no means of accurate examination) than forty or fifty"
edgarallanpoe,"yards. Upon first descending into the chasm, that is to say, for a"
edgarallanpoe,"hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill, the sides of the"
edgarallanpoe,"abyss bore little resemblance to each other, and, apparently, had at"
edgarallanpoe,"no time been connected, the one surface being of the soapstone, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"other of marl, granulated with some metallic matter. The average breadth"
edgarallanpoe,"or interval between the two cliffs was probably here sixty feet, but"
edgarallanpoe,"there seemed to be no regularity of formation. Passing down, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"beyond the limit spoken of, the interval rapidly contracted, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"sides began to run parallel, although, for some distance farther,"
edgarallanpoe,they were still dissimilar in their material and form of surface.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon arriving within fifty feet of the bottom, a perfect regularity"
edgarallanpoe,"commenced. The sides were now entirely uniform in substance, in colour,"
edgarallanpoe,"and in lateral direction, the material being a very black and shining"
edgarallanpoe,"granite, and the distance between the two sides, at all points facing"
edgarallanpoe,"each other, exactly twenty yards. The precise formation of the chasm"
edgarallanpoe,will be best understood by means of a delineation taken upon the spot;
edgarallanpoe,"for I had luckily with me a pocketbook and pencil, which I preserved"
edgarallanpoe,"with great care through a long series of subsequent adventure, and to"
edgarallanpoe,which I am indebted for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise
edgarallanpoe,have been crowded from my remembrance.
edgarallanpoe,This figure [No figures in text] gives the general outlines of the
edgarallanpoe,"chasm, without the minor cavities in the sides, of which there were"
edgarallanpoe,"several, each cavity having a corresponding protuberance opposite. The"
edgarallanpoe,bottom of the gulf was covered to the depth of three or four inches with
edgarallanpoe,"a powder almost impalpable, beneath which we found a continuation of the"
edgarallanpoe,"black granite. To the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the"
edgarallanpoe,"appearance of a small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above, and"
edgarallanpoe,to examine which more minutely than before was the object of our second
edgarallanpoe,"visit. We now pushed into it with vigor, cutting away a quantity of"
edgarallanpoe,"brambles which impeded us, and removing a vast heap of sharp flints"
edgarallanpoe,somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape. We were encouraged to
edgarallanpoe,"persevere, however, by perceiving some little light proceeding from the"
edgarallanpoe,"farther end. We at length squeezed our way for about thirty feet, and"
edgarallanpoe,"found that the aperture was a low and regularly formed arch, having a"
edgarallanpoe,bottom of the same impalpable powder as that in the main chasm. A strong
edgarallanpoe,"light now broke upon us, and, turning a short bend, we found ourselves"
edgarallanpoe,"in another lofty chamber, similar to the one we had left in every"
edgarallanpoe,respect but longitudinal form. Its general figure is here given.
edgarallanpoe,"The total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening _a_ and"
edgarallanpoe,"proceeding round the curve _b_ to the extremity _d_, is five hundred and"
edgarallanpoe,fifty yards. At _c_ we discovered a small aperture similar to the one
edgarallanpoe,"through which we had issued from the other chasm, and this was choked up"
edgarallanpoe,in the same manner with brambles and a quantity of the white arrowhead
edgarallanpoe,"flints. We forced our way through it, finding it about forty feet long,"
edgarallanpoe,"and emerged into a third chasm. This, too, was precisely like the"
edgarallanpoe,"first, except in its longitudinal shape, which was thus."
edgarallanpoe,We found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and
edgarallanpoe,"twenty yards. At the point _a_ was an opening about six feet wide, and"
edgarallanpoe,"extending fifteen feet into the rock, where it terminated in a bed of"
edgarallanpoe,"marl, there being no other chasm beyond, as we had expected. We were"
edgarallanpoe,"about leaving this fissure, into which very little light was admitted,"
edgarallanpoe,when Peters called my attention to a range of singular-looking
edgarallanpoe,indentures in the surface of the marl forming the termination of the
edgarallanpoe,"_cul-de-sac_. With a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left,"
edgarallanpoe,or most northern of these indentures might have been taken for the
edgarallanpoe,"intentional, although rude, representation of a human figure standing"
edgarallanpoe,"erect, with outstretched arm. The rest of them bore also some little"
edgarallanpoe,"resemblance to alphabetical characters, and Peters was willing, at"
edgarallanpoe,"all events, to adopt the idle opinion that they were really such. I"
edgarallanpoe,"convinced him of his error, finally, by directing his attention to the"
edgarallanpoe,"floor of the fissure, where, among the powder, we picked up, piece by"
edgarallanpoe,"piece, several large flakes of the marl, which had evidently been broken"
edgarallanpoe,"off by some convulsion from the surface where the indentures were found,"
edgarallanpoe,and which had projecting points exactly fitting the indentures; thus
edgarallanpoe,proving them to have been the work of nature.
edgarallanpoe,After satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded us no
edgarallanpoe,"means of escape from our prison, we made our way back, dejected and"
edgarallanpoe,"dispirited, to the summit of the hill. Nothing worth mentioning occurred"
edgarallanpoe,"during the next twenty-four hours, except that, in examining the ground"
edgarallanpoe,"to the eastward of the third chasm, we found two triangular holes of"
edgarallanpoe,"great depth, and also with black granite sides. Into these holes we"
edgarallanpoe,"did not think it worth while to attempt descending, as they had the"
edgarallanpoe,"appearance of mere natural wells, without outlet. They were each about"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty yards in circumference, and their shape, as well as relative"
edgarallanpoe,"position in regard to the third chasm, is shown in figure 5. {image}"
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 24
edgarallanpoe,"ON the twentieth of the month, finding it altogether impossible to"
edgarallanpoe,"subsist any longer upon the filberts, the use of which occasioned us the"
edgarallanpoe,"most excruciating torment, we resolved to make a desperate attempt at"
edgarallanpoe,descending the southern declivity of the hill. The face of the
edgarallanpoe,"precipice was here of the softest species of soapstone, although nearly"
edgarallanpoe,perpendicular throughout its whole extent (a depth of a hundred and
edgarallanpoe,"fifty feet at the least), and in many places even overarching. After"
edgarallanpoe,a long search we discovered a narrow ledge about twenty feet below
edgarallanpoe,"the brink of the gulf; upon this Peters contrived to leap, with what"
edgarallanpoe,assistance I could render him by means of our pocket-handkerchiefs tied
edgarallanpoe,together. With somewhat more difficulty I also got down; and we then saw
edgarallanpoe,the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in which we
edgarallanpoe,had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried by the fall of
edgarallanpoe,"the hill--that is, by cutting steps in the face of the soapstone with"
edgarallanpoe,our knives. The extreme hazard of the attempt can scarcely be conceived;
edgarallanpoe,"but, as there was no other resource, we determined to undertake it."
edgarallanpoe,Upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert-bushes; and to one
edgarallanpoe,of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs. The other end
edgarallanpoe,"being tied round Peters’ waist, I lowered him down over the edge of the"
edgarallanpoe,precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight. He now proceeded
edgarallanpoe,"to dig a deep hole in the soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches),"
edgarallanpoe,"sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout,"
edgarallanpoe,"so as to allow of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably"
edgarallanpoe,strong peg into the levelled surface. I then drew him up for about four
edgarallanpoe,"feet, when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a peg as"
edgarallanpoe,"before, and having thus a resting-place for both feet and hands. I now"
edgarallanpoe,"unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing him the end, which"
edgarallanpoe,"he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole, letting himself down gently"
edgarallanpoe,"to a station about three feet lower than he had yet been that is, to the"
edgarallanpoe,"full extent of the handkerchiefs. Here he dug another hole, and drove"
edgarallanpoe,"another peg. He then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole"
edgarallanpoe,"just cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above. It"
edgarallanpoe,"was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost peg, with"
edgarallanpoe,the view of fastening them to the second; and here he found that an
edgarallanpoe,error had been committed in cutting the holes at so great a distance
edgarallanpoe,"apart. However, after one or two unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at"
edgarallanpoe,reaching the knot (having to hold on with his left hand while he labored
edgarallanpoe,"to undo the fastening with his right), he at length cut the string,"
edgarallanpoe,leaving six inches of it affixed to the peg. Tying the handkerchiefs
edgarallanpoe,"now to the second peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking"
edgarallanpoe,care not to go too far down. By these means (means which I should never
edgarallanpoe,"have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted altogether to"
edgarallanpoe,"Peters’ ingenuity and resolution) my companion finally succeeded, with"
edgarallanpoe,"the occasional aid of projections in the cliff, in reaching the bottom"
edgarallanpoe,without accident.
edgarallanpoe,It was some time before I could summon sufficient resolution to follow
edgarallanpoe,him; but I did at length attempt it. Peters had taken off his shirt
edgarallanpoe,"before descending, and this, with my own, formed the rope necessary"
edgarallanpoe,"for the adventure. After throwing down the musket found in the chasm, I"
edgarallanpoe,"fastened this rope to the bushes, and let myself down rapidly, striving,"
edgarallanpoe,"by the vigor of my movements, to banish the trepidation which I could"
edgarallanpoe,overcome in no other manner. This answered sufficiently well for the
edgarallanpoe,first four or five steps; but presently I found my imagination growing
edgarallanpoe,"terribly excited by thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended, and"
edgarallanpoe,the precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my only
edgarallanpoe,"support. It was in vain I endeavored to banish these reflections, and to"
edgarallanpoe,keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat surface of the cliff before me.
edgarallanpoe,"The more earnestly I struggled _not to think, _the more intensely vivid"
edgarallanpoe,"became my conceptions, and the more horribly distinct. At length arrived"
edgarallanpoe,"that crisis of fancy, so fearful in all similar cases, the crisis in"
edgarallanpoe,which we began to anticipate the feelings with which we _shall _fall--to
edgarallanpoe,"picture to ourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last struggle,"
edgarallanpoe,"and the half swoon, and the final bitterness of the rushing and headlong"
edgarallanpoe,"descent. And now I found these fancies creating their own realities, and"
edgarallanpoe,all imagined horrors crowding upon me in fact. I felt my knees strike
edgarallanpoe,"violently together, while my fingers were gradually but certainly"
edgarallanpoe,"relaxing their grasp. There was a ringing in my ears, and I said, “This"
edgarallanpoe,is my knell of death!” And now I was consumed with the irrepressible
edgarallanpoe,"desire of looking below. I could not, I would not, confine my glances to"
edgarallanpoe,"the cliff; and, with a wild, indefinable emotion, half of horror, half"
edgarallanpoe,"of a relieved oppression, I threw my vision far down into the abyss. For"
edgarallanpoe,"one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon their hold, while, with"
edgarallanpoe,"the movement, the faintest possible idea of ultimate escape wandered,"
edgarallanpoe,"like a shadow, through my mind--in the next my whole soul was pervaded"
edgarallanpoe,"with a longing to fall; a desire, a yearning, a passion utterly"
edgarallanpoe,"uncontrollable. I let go at once my grasp upon the peg, and, turning"
edgarallanpoe,"half round from the precipice, remained tottering for an instant"
edgarallanpoe,against its naked face. But now there came a spinning of the brain;
edgarallanpoe,"a shrill-sounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears; a dusky,"
edgarallanpoe,"fiendish, and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me; and, sighing, I"
edgarallanpoe,"sunk down with a bursting heart, and plunged within its arms."
edgarallanpoe,"I had swooned, and Peters had caught me as I fell. He had observed my"
edgarallanpoe,proceedings from his station at the bottom of the cliff; and perceiving
edgarallanpoe,"my imminent danger, had endeavored to inspire me with courage by every"
edgarallanpoe,suggestion he could devise; although my confusion of mind had been so
edgarallanpoe,"great as to prevent my hearing what he said, or being conscious that he"
edgarallanpoe,"had even spoken to me at all. At length, seeing me totter, he hastened"
edgarallanpoe,"to ascend to my rescue, and arrived just in time for my preservation."
edgarallanpoe,"Had I fallen with my full weight, the rope of linen would inevitably"
edgarallanpoe,"have snapped, and I should have been precipitated into the abyss; as"
edgarallanpoe,"it was, he contrived to let me down gently, so as to remain suspended"
edgarallanpoe,without danger until animation returned. This was in about fifteen
edgarallanpoe,"minutes. On recovery, my trepidation had entirely vanished; I felt a new"
edgarallanpoe,"being, and, with some little further aid from my companion, reached the"
edgarallanpoe,bottom also in safety.
edgarallanpoe,We now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved the
edgarallanpoe,"tomb of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where the hill had"
edgarallanpoe,"fallen. The place was one of singular wildness, and its aspect brought"
edgarallanpoe,to my mind the descriptions given by travellers of those dreary regions
edgarallanpoe,marking the site of degraded Babylon. Not to speak of the ruins of the
edgarallanpoe,"disrupted cliff, which formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the"
edgarallanpoe,"northward, the surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn"
edgarallanpoe,"with huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of"
edgarallanpoe,"art; although, in detail, no semblance of art could be detected."
edgarallanpoe,"Scoria were abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black granite,"
edgarallanpoe,"intermingled with others of marl, {*6} and both granulated with metal."
edgarallanpoe,Of vegetation there were no traces whatsoever throughout the whole of
edgarallanpoe,"the desolate area within sight. Several immense scorpions were seen,"
edgarallanpoe,and various reptiles not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes. As
edgarallanpoe,"food was our most immediate object, we resolved to make our way to the"
edgarallanpoe,"seacoast, distant not more than half a mile, with a view of catching"
edgarallanpoe,"turtle, several of which we had observed from our place of concealment"
edgarallanpoe,"on the hill. We had proceeded some hundred yards, threading our route"
edgarallanpoe,"cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli, when, upon turning a"
edgarallanpoe,"corner, five savages sprung upon us from a small cavern, felling Peters"
edgarallanpoe,to the ground with a blow from a club. As he fell the whole party rushed
edgarallanpoe,"upon him to secure their victim, leaving me time to recover from my"
edgarallanpoe,"astonishment. I still had the musket, but the barrel had received so"
edgarallanpoe,much injury in being thrown from the precipice that I cast it aside
edgarallanpoe,"as useless, preferring to trust my pistols, which had been carefully"
edgarallanpoe,"preserved in order. With these I advanced upon the assailants, firing"
edgarallanpoe,"one after the other in quick succession. Two savages fell, and one,"
edgarallanpoe,"who was in the act of thrusting a spear into Peters, sprung to his feet"
edgarallanpoe,"without accomplishing his purpose. My companion being thus released,"
edgarallanpoe,"we had no further difficulty. He had his pistols also, but prudently"
edgarallanpoe,"declined using them, confiding in his great personal strength, which far"
edgarallanpoe,exceeded that of any person I have ever known. Seizing a club from one
edgarallanpoe,"of the savages who had fallen, he dashed out the brains of the three who"
edgarallanpoe,"remained, killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the weapon,"
edgarallanpoe,and leaving us completely masters of the field.
edgarallanpoe,"So rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely believe"
edgarallanpoe,"in their reality, and were standing over the bodies of the dead in a"
edgarallanpoe,"species of stupid contemplation, when we were brought to recollection by"
edgarallanpoe,the sound of shouts in the distance. It was clear that the savages had
edgarallanpoe,"been alarmed by the firing, and that we had little chance of avoiding"
edgarallanpoe,"discovery. To regain the cliff, it would be necessary to proceed in the"
edgarallanpoe,"direction of the shouts, and even should we succeed in arriving at"
edgarallanpoe,"its base, we should never be able to ascend it without being seen. Our"
edgarallanpoe,"situation was one of the greatest peril, and we were hesitating in which"
edgarallanpoe,"path to commence a flight, when one of the savages _whom _I had shot,"
edgarallanpoe,"and supposed dead, sprang briskly to his feet, and attempted to make his"
edgarallanpoe,"escape. We overtook _him, _however, before he had advanced many paces,"
edgarallanpoe,"and were about to put him to death, when Peters suggested that we might"
edgarallanpoe,derive some benefit from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to
edgarallanpoe,"escape. We therefore dragged him with us, making him understand that"
edgarallanpoe,we would shoot him if he offered resistance. In a few minutes he was
edgarallanpoe,"perfectly submissive, and ran by our sides as we pushed in among the"
edgarallanpoe,"rocks, making for the seashore."
edgarallanpoe,"So far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing hid"
edgarallanpoe,"the sea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we first had it"
edgarallanpoe,"fairly in view, it was perhaps two hundred yards distant. As we emerged"
edgarallanpoe,"into the open beach we saw, to our great dismay, an immense crowd of the"
edgarallanpoe,"natives pouring from the village, and from all visible quarters of"
edgarallanpoe,"the island, making toward us with gesticulations of extreme fury, and"
edgarallanpoe,howling like wild beasts. We were upon the point of turning upon our
edgarallanpoe,"steps, and trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the"
edgarallanpoe,"rougher ground, when I discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from"
edgarallanpoe,behind a large rock which ran out into the water. Toward these we
edgarallanpoe,"now ran with all speed, and, reaching them, found them unguarded, and"
edgarallanpoe,without any other freight than three of the large Gallipago turtles
edgarallanpoe,and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers. We instantly took
edgarallanpoe,"possession of one of them, and, forcing our captive on board, pushed out"
edgarallanpoe,to sea with all the strength we could command.
edgarallanpoe,"We had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore before we"
edgarallanpoe,became sufficiently calm to perceive the great oversight of which we had
edgarallanpoe,"been guilty in leaving the other canoe in the power of the savages,"
edgarallanpoe,"who, by this time, were not more than twice as far from the beach as"
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves, and were rapidly advancing to the pursuit. No time was now to"
edgarallanpoe,"be lost. Our hope was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none other. It"
edgarallanpoe,"was very doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could get back"
edgarallanpoe,in time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe; but
edgarallanpoe,yet there was a chance that we could. We might save ourselves if we
edgarallanpoe,"succeeded, while not to make the attempt was to resign ourselves to"
edgarallanpoe,inevitable butchery.
edgarallanpoe,"The canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in place of"
edgarallanpoe,"turning it around, we merely changed our position in paddling. As soon"
edgarallanpoe,"as the savages perceived this they redoubled their yells, as well as"
edgarallanpoe,"their speed, and approached with inconceivable rapidity. We pulled,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, with all the energy of desperation, and arrived at the"
edgarallanpoe,contested point before more than one of the natives had attained it.
edgarallanpoe,"This man paid dearly for his superior agility, Peters shooting him"
edgarallanpoe,through the head with a pistol as he approached the shore. The foremost
edgarallanpoe,among the rest of his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces
edgarallanpoe,distant as we seized upon the canoe. We at first endeavored to pull her
edgarallanpoe,"into the deep water, beyond the reach of the savages, but, finding her"
edgarallanpoe,"too firmly aground, and there being no time to spare, Peters, with one"
edgarallanpoe,"or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket, succeeded in dashing"
edgarallanpoe,out a large portion of the bow and of one side. We then pushed off.
edgarallanpoe,"Two of the natives by this time had got hold of our boat, obstinately"
edgarallanpoe,"refusing to let go, until we were forced to despatch them with our"
edgarallanpoe,"knives. We were now clear off, and making great way out to sea. The main"
edgarallanpoe,"body of the savages, upon reaching the broken canoe, set up the most"
edgarallanpoe,"tremendous yell of rage and disappointment conceivable. In truth, from"
edgarallanpoe,"everything I could see of these wretches, they appeared to be the most"
edgarallanpoe,"wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty, and altogether fiendish"
edgarallanpoe,race of men upon the face of the globe. It is clear we should have had
edgarallanpoe,no mercy had we fallen into their hands. They made a mad attempt at
edgarallanpoe,"following us in the fractured canoe, but, finding it useless, again"
edgarallanpoe,"vented their rage in a series of hideous vociferations, and rushed up"
edgarallanpoe,into the hills.
edgarallanpoe,"We were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation was still"
edgarallanpoe,sufficiently gloomy. We knew that four canoes of the kind we had were
edgarallanpoe,"at one time in the possession of the savages, and were not aware of the"
edgarallanpoe,fact (afterward ascertained from our captive) that two of these had
edgarallanpoe,"been blown to pieces in the explosion of the _Jane Guy. _We calculated,"
edgarallanpoe,"therefore, upon being yet pursued, as soon as our enemies could get"
edgarallanpoe,round to the bay (distant about three miles) where the boats were
edgarallanpoe,"usually laid up. Fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the"
edgarallanpoe,"island behind us, and went rapidly through the water, forcing the"
edgarallanpoe,"prisoner to take a paddle. In about half an hour, when we had gained"
edgarallanpoe,"probably five or six miles to the southward, a large fleet of the"
edgarallanpoe,flat-bottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay evidently
edgarallanpoe,"with the design of pursuit. Presently they put back, despairing to"
edgarallanpoe,overtake us.
edgarallanpoe,CHAPTER 25
edgarallanpoe,"WE now found ourselves in the wide and desolate Antarctic Ocean, in a"
edgarallanpoe,"latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe, and with no"
edgarallanpoe,"provision but the three turtles. The long polar winter, too, could not"
edgarallanpoe,"be considered as far distant, and it became necessary that we should"
edgarallanpoe,deliberate well upon the course to be pursued. There were six or seven
edgarallanpoe,"islands in sight belonging to the same group, and distant from each"
edgarallanpoe,other about five or six leagues; but upon neither of these had we any
edgarallanpoe,intention to venture. In coming from the northward in the _Jane Guy_ we
edgarallanpoe,"had been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of ice--this,"
edgarallanpoe,however little it maybe in accordance with the generally received
edgarallanpoe,"notions respecting the Antarctic, was a fact--experience would not"
edgarallanpoe,"permit us to deny. To attempt, therefore, getting back would be"
edgarallanpoe,folly--especially at so late a period of the season. Only one course
edgarallanpoe,seemed to be left open for hope. We resolved to steer boldly to the
edgarallanpoe,"southward, where there was at least a probability of discovering other"
edgarallanpoe,"lands, and more than a probability of finding a still milder climate."
edgarallanpoe,"So far we had found the Antarctic, like the Arctic Ocean, peculiarly"
edgarallanpoe,"free from violent storms or immoderately rough water; but our canoe was,"
edgarallanpoe,"at best, of frail structure, although large, and we set busily to"
edgarallanpoe,work with a view of rendering her as safe as the limited means in our
edgarallanpoe,possession would admit. The body of the boat was of no better material
edgarallanpoe,"than bark--the bark of a tree unknown. The ribs were of a tough osier,"
edgarallanpoe,well adapted to the purpose for which it was used. We had fifty feet
edgarallanpoe,"room from stem to stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth"
edgarallanpoe,throughout four feet and a half-the boats thus differing vastly in shape
edgarallanpoe,from those of any other inhabitants of the Southern Ocean with whom
edgarallanpoe,civilized nations are acquainted. We never did believe them the
edgarallanpoe,workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them; and some days
edgarallanpoe,"after this period discovered, by questioning our captive, that they were"
edgarallanpoe,in fact made by the natives of a group to the southwest of the country
edgarallanpoe,"where we found them, having fallen accidentally into the hands of our"
edgarallanpoe,barbarians. What we could do for the security of our boat was very
edgarallanpoe,"little indeed. Several wide rents were discovered near both ends, and"
edgarallanpoe,these we contrived to patch up with pieces of woollen jacket. With the
edgarallanpoe,"help of the superfluous paddles, of which there were a great many, we"
edgarallanpoe,"erected a kind of framework about the bow, so as to break the force of"
edgarallanpoe,any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter. We also set
edgarallanpoe,"up two paddle-blades for masts, placing them opposite each other, one"
edgarallanpoe,"by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard. To these masts we"
edgarallanpoe,"attached a sail made of our shirts-doing this with some difficulty, as"
edgarallanpoe,"here we could get no assistance from our prisoner whatever, although he"
edgarallanpoe,had been willing enough to labor in all the other operations. The sight
edgarallanpoe,of the linen seemed to affect him in a very singular manner. He could
edgarallanpoe,"not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we"
edgarallanpoe,"attempted to force him, and shrieking out, _“Tekeli-li!”_"
edgarallanpoe,Having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of the
edgarallanpoe,"canoe, we now set sail to the south-southeast for the present, with the"
edgarallanpoe,view of weathering the most southerly of the group in sight. This being
edgarallanpoe,"done, we turned the bow full to the southward. The weather could by no"
edgarallanpoe,means be considered disagreeable. We had a prevailing and very gentle
edgarallanpoe,"wind from the northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight. No ice"
edgarallanpoe,whatever was to be seen; _nor did I ever see one particle of this after
edgarallanpoe,"leaving the parallel of Bennet’s Islet. _Indeed, the temperature of the"
edgarallanpoe,water was here far too warm for its existence in any quantity. Having
edgarallanpoe,"killed the largest of our tortoises, and obtained from him not only food"
edgarallanpoe,"but a copious supply of water, we continued on our course, without any"
edgarallanpoe,"incident of moment, for perhaps seven or eight days, during which period"
edgarallanpoe,"we must have proceeded a vast distance to the southward, as the wind"
edgarallanpoe,"blew constantly with us, and a very strong current set continually in"
edgarallanpoe,the direction we were pursuing.
edgarallanpoe,_March 1st_. {*7}-Many unusual phenomena now--indicated that we were
edgarallanpoe,entering upon a region of novelty and wonder. A high range of light
edgarallanpoe,"gray vapor appeared constantly in the southern horizon, flaring up"
edgarallanpoe,"occasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east to west, now from"
edgarallanpoe,"west to east, and again presenting a level and uniform summit--in short,"
edgarallanpoe,having all the wild variations of the Aurora Borealis. The average
edgarallanpoe,"height of this vapor, as apparent from our station, was about"
edgarallanpoe,twenty-five degrees. The temperature of the sea seemed to be increasing
edgarallanpoe,"momentarily, and there was a very perceptible alteration in its color."
edgarallanpoe,"_March 2d._-To-day by repeated questioning of our captive, we came"
edgarallanpoe,to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island of the
edgarallanpoe,"massacre, its inhabitants, and customs--but with these how can I now"
edgarallanpoe,"detain the reader? I may say, however, that we learned there were eight"
edgarallanpoe,"islands in the group--that they were governed by a common king, named"
edgarallanpoe,"_Tsalemon _or _Psalemoun, _who resided in one of the smallest of the"
edgarallanpoe,islands; that the black skins forming the dress of the warriors came
edgarallanpoe,from an animal of huge size to be found only in a valley near the court
edgarallanpoe,of the king--that the inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats
edgarallanpoe,than the flat-bottomed rafts; the four canoes being all of the kind in
edgarallanpoe,"their possession, and, these having been obtained, by mere accident,"
edgarallanpoe,from some large island in the southwest--that his own name was Nu-Nu--that
edgarallanpoe,he had no knowledge of Bennet’s Islet--and that the appellation of the
edgarallanpoe,island he had left was Tsalal. The commencement of the words _Tsalemon
edgarallanpoe,"_and Tsalal was given with a prolonged hissing sound, which we found"
edgarallanpoe,"it impossible to imitate, even after repeated endeavors, and which was"
edgarallanpoe,precisely the same with the note of the black bittern we had eaten up on
edgarallanpoe,the summit of the hill.
edgarallanpoe,"_March 3d._-The heat of the water was now truly remarkable, and in color"
edgarallanpoe,"was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer transparent, but of a"
edgarallanpoe,milky consistency and hue. In our immediate vicinity it was usually
edgarallanpoe,"smooth, never so rough as to endanger the canoe--but we were frequently"
edgarallanpoe,"surprised at perceiving, to our right and left, at different distances,"
edgarallanpoe,"sudden and extensive agitations of the surface; these, we at length"
edgarallanpoe,"noticed, were always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapor"
edgarallanpoe,to the southward.
edgarallanpoe,"_March 4th._-To-day, with the view of widening our sail, the breeze from"
edgarallanpoe,"the northward dying away perceptibly, I took from my coat-pocket a white"
edgarallanpoe,"handkerchief. Nu-Nu was seated at my elbow, and the linen accidentally"
edgarallanpoe,"flaring in his face, he became violently affected with convulsions."
edgarallanpoe,"These were succeeded by drowsiness and stupor, and low murmurings of"
edgarallanpoe,_“‘Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”_
edgarallanpoe,"_March _5th.-The wind had entirely ceased, but it was evident that"
edgarallanpoe,"we were still hurrying on to the southward, under the influence of a"
edgarallanpoe,"powerful current. And now,--indeed, it would seem reasonable that we"
edgarallanpoe,should experience some alarm at the turn events were taking--but we
edgarallanpoe,"felt none. The countenance of Peters indicated nothing of this nature,"
edgarallanpoe,although it wore at times an expression I could not fathom. The polar
edgarallanpoe,winter appeared to be coming on--but coming without its terrors. I felt
edgarallanpoe,a numbness of body and mind--a dreaminess of sensation but this was all.
edgarallanpoe,_March 6th._-The gray vapor had now arisen many more degrees above the
edgarallanpoe,"horizon, and was gradually losing its grayness of tint. The heat of the"
edgarallanpoe,"water was extreme, even unpleasant to the touch, and its milky hue was"
edgarallanpoe,more evident than ever. Today a violent agitation of the water occurred
edgarallanpoe,"very close to the canoe. It was attended, as usual, with a wild flaring"
edgarallanpoe,"up of the vapor at its summit, and a momentary division at its base. A"
edgarallanpoe,"fine white powder, resembling ashes--but certainly not such--fell over the"
edgarallanpoe,"canoe and over a large surface of the water, as the flickering died away"
edgarallanpoe,among the vapor and the commotion subsided in the sea. Nu-Nu now threw
edgarallanpoe,"himself on his face in the bottom of the boat, and no persuasions could"
edgarallanpoe,induce him to arise.
edgarallanpoe,_March 7th._-This day we questioned Nu-Nu concerning the motives of
edgarallanpoe,his countrymen in destroying our companions; but he appeared to be too
edgarallanpoe,utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational reply. He still
edgarallanpoe,"obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat; and, upon reiterating the"
edgarallanpoe,"questions as to the motive, made use only of idiotic gesticulations,"
edgarallanpoe,"such as raising with his forefinger the upper lip, and displaying the"
edgarallanpoe,teeth which lay beneath it. These were black. We had never before seen
edgarallanpoe,the teeth of an inhabitant of Tsalal.
edgarallanpoe,_March 8th._-To-day there floated by us one of the white animals whose
edgarallanpoe,appearance upon the beach at Tsalal had occasioned so wild a commotion
edgarallanpoe,"among the savages. I would have picked it up, but there came over me"
edgarallanpoe,"a sudden listlessness, and I forbore. The heat of the water still"
edgarallanpoe,"increased, and the hand could no longer be endured within it. Peters"
edgarallanpoe,"spoke little, and I knew not what to think of his apathy. Nu-Nu"
edgarallanpoe,"breathed, and no more."
edgarallanpoe,"_March 9th._-The whole ashy material fell now continually around us,"
edgarallanpoe,and in vast quantities. The range of vapor to the southward had arisen
edgarallanpoe,"prodigiously in the horizon, and began to assume more distinctness"
edgarallanpoe,"of form. I can liken it to nothing but a limitless cataract, rolling"
edgarallanpoe,silently into the sea from some immense and far-distant rampart in
edgarallanpoe,the heaven. The gigantic curtain ranged along the whole extent of the
edgarallanpoe,southern horizon. It emitted no sound.
edgarallanpoe,_March 21st._-A sullen darkness now hovered above us--but from out the
edgarallanpoe,"milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose, and stole up along"
edgarallanpoe,the bulwarks of the boat. We were nearly overwhelmed by the white ashy
edgarallanpoe,"shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe, but melted into the"
edgarallanpoe,water as it fell. The summit of the cataract was utterly lost in the
edgarallanpoe,dimness and the distance. Yet we were evidently approaching it with a
edgarallanpoe,"hideous velocity. At intervals there were visible in it wide, yawning,"
edgarallanpoe,"but momentary rents, and from out these rents, within which was a chaos"
edgarallanpoe,"of flitting and indistinct images, there came rushing and mighty, but"
edgarallanpoe,"soundless winds, tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course."
edgarallanpoe,"_March 22d._-The darkness had materially increased, relieved only by the"
edgarallanpoe,glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain before us. Many
edgarallanpoe,gigantic and pallidly white birds flew continuously now from beyond the
edgarallanpoe,"veil, and their scream was the eternal _Tekeli-li! _as they retreated"
edgarallanpoe,from our vision. Hereupon Nu-Nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but
edgarallanpoe,upon touching him we found his spirit departed. And now we rushed into
edgarallanpoe,"the embraces of the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive"
edgarallanpoe,"us. But there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very far"
edgarallanpoe,larger in its proportions than any dweller among men. And the hue of the
edgarallanpoe,skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow.
edgarallanpoe,NOTE
edgarallanpoe,THE circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing death
edgarallanpoe,of Mr. Pym are already well known to the public through the medium of
edgarallanpoe,the daily press. It is feared that the few remaining chapters which were
edgarallanpoe,"to have completed his narrative, and which were retained by him,"
edgarallanpoe,"while the above were in type, for the purpose of revision, have been"
edgarallanpoe,irrecoverably lost through the accident by which he perished himself.
edgarallanpoe,"This, however, may prove not to be the case, and the papers, if"
edgarallanpoe,"ultimately found, will be given to the public."
edgarallanpoe,No means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency. The gentleman
edgarallanpoe,"whose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from the statement"
edgarallanpoe,"there made, might be supposed able to fill the vacuum, has declined"
edgarallanpoe,"the task--this, for satisfactory reasons connected with the general"
edgarallanpoe,"inaccuracy of the details afforded him, and his disbelief in the entire"
edgarallanpoe,"truth of the latter portions of the narration. Peters, from whom"
edgarallanpoe,"some information might be expected, is still alive, and a resident of"
edgarallanpoe,"Illinois, but cannot be met with at present. He may hereafter be found,"
edgarallanpoe,"and will, no doubt, afford material for a conclusion of Mr. Pym’s"
edgarallanpoe,account.
edgarallanpoe,The loss of two or three final chapters (for there were but two or
edgarallanpoe,"three) is the more deeply to be regretted, as it can not be doubted they"
edgarallanpoe,"contained matter relative to the Pole itself, or at least to regions in"
edgarallanpoe,"its very near proximity; and as, too, the statements of the author in"
edgarallanpoe,relation to these regions may shortly be verified or contradicted by
edgarallanpoe,means of the governmental expedition now preparing for the Southern
edgarallanpoe,Ocean.
edgarallanpoe,On one point in the narrative some remarks may well be offered; and it
edgarallanpoe,would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if what he may
edgarallanpoe,"here observe should have a tendency to throw credit, in any degree, upon"
edgarallanpoe,the very singular pages now published. We allude to the chasms found in
edgarallanpoe,"the island of Tsalal, and to the whole of the figures upon pages 245-47"
edgarallanpoe,{of the printed edition--ed.}.
edgarallanpoe,(Note: No figures were included with this text)
edgarallanpoe,"Mr. Pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment, and"
edgarallanpoe,speaks decidedly of the _indentures _found at the extremity of the
edgarallanpoe,most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful resemblance to
edgarallanpoe,"alphabetical characters, and, in short, as being positively _not such."
edgarallanpoe,"_This assertion is made in a manner so simple, and sustained by a"
edgarallanpoe,"species of demonstration so conclusive (viz., the fitting of the"
edgarallanpoe,projections of the fragments found among the dust into the indentures
edgarallanpoe,"upon the wall), that we are forced to believe the writer in earnest;"
edgarallanpoe,and no reasonable reader should suppose otherwise. But as the facts in
edgarallanpoe,relation to all the figures are most singular (especially when taken in
edgarallanpoe,"connection with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may"
edgarallanpoe,"be as well to say a word or two concerning them all--this, too, the more"
edgarallanpoe,"especially as the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped the"
edgarallanpoe,attention of Mr. Poe.
edgarallanpoe,"Figure 1, then, figure 2, figure 3, and figure 5, when conjoined with"
edgarallanpoe,"one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves presented,"
edgarallanpoe,"and when deprived of the small lateral branches or arches (which, it"
edgarallanpoe,"will be remembered, served only as a means of communication between the"
edgarallanpoe,"main chambers, and were of totally distinct character), constitute an"
edgarallanpoe,"Ethiopian verbal root--the root “To be shady,’--whence all the"
edgarallanpoe,inflections of shadow or darkness.
edgarallanpoe,In regard to the “left or most northwardly” of the indentures in figure
edgarallanpoe,"4, it is more than probable that the opinion of Peters was correct,"
edgarallanpoe,"and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the work of art,"
edgarallanpoe,and intended as the representation of a human form. The delineation
edgarallanpoe,"is before the reader, and he may, or may not, perceive the resemblance"
edgarallanpoe,suggested; but the rest of the indentures afford strong confirmation
edgarallanpoe,of Peters’ idea. The upper range is evidently the Arabic verbal root
edgarallanpoe,"“To be white,” whence all the inflections of brilliancy and"
edgarallanpoe,whiteness. The lower range is not so immediately perspicuous. The
edgarallanpoe,"characters are somewhat broken and disjointed; nevertheless, it can not"
edgarallanpoe,"be doubted that, in their perfect state, they formed the full Egyptian"
edgarallanpoe,"word, “The region of the south.” It should be observed that"
edgarallanpoe,these interpretations confirm the opinion of Peters in regard to the
edgarallanpoe,“most northwardly” of the figures. The arm is outstretched toward the
edgarallanpoe,south.
edgarallanpoe,Conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and exciting
edgarallanpoe,"conjecture. They should be regarded, perhaps, in connection with some"
edgarallanpoe,of the most faintly detailed incidents of the narrative; although in no
edgarallanpoe,visible manner is this chain of connection complete. Tekeli-li! was the
edgarallanpoe,cry of the affrighted natives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcase
edgarallanpoe,of the _white _animal picked up at sea. This also was the shuddering
edgarallanpoe,exclamatives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the _white
edgarallanpoe,_materials in possession of Mr. Pym. This also was the shriek of the
edgarallanpoe,"swift-flying, _white, _and gigantic birds which issued from the vapory"
edgarallanpoe,"_white _curtain of the South. Nothing _white _was to be found at Tsalal,"
edgarallanpoe,and nothing otherwise in the subsequent voyage to the region beyond. It
edgarallanpoe,"is not impossible that “Tsalal,” the appellation of the island of the"
edgarallanpoe,"chasms, may be found, upon minute philological scrutiny, to betray"
edgarallanpoe,"either some alliance with the chasms themselves, or some reference to"
edgarallanpoe,the Ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings.
edgarallanpoe,"_“I have graven it within the hills, and my vengeance upon the dust"
edgarallanpoe,within the rock.”_
edgarallanpoe,Notes
edgarallanpoe,{*1} Whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oil-tanks--why the
edgarallanpoe,_Grampus_ was not I have never been able to ascertain.
edgarallanpoe,"{*2} The case of the brig _Polly_, of Boston, is one so much in point,"
edgarallanpoe,"and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to our own, that"
edgarallanpoe,"I cannot forbear alluding to it here. This vessel, of one hundred and"
edgarallanpoe,"thirty tons burden, sailed from Boston, with a cargo of lumber and"
edgarallanpoe,"provisions, for Santa Croix, on the twelfth of December, 1811, under the"
edgarallanpoe,command of Captain Casneau. There were eight souls on board besides the
edgarallanpoe,"captain--the mate, four seamen, and the cook, together with a Mr. Hunt,"
edgarallanpoe,"and a negro girl belonging to him. On the fifteenth, having cleared"
edgarallanpoe,"the shoal of Georges, she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the"
edgarallanpoe,"southeast, and was finally capsized; but, the masts going by the board,"
edgarallanpoe,"she afterward righted. They remained in this situation, without fire,"
edgarallanpoe,"and with very little provision, for the period of one hundred and"
edgarallanpoe,"ninety-one days (from December the fifteenth to June the twentieth),"
edgarallanpoe,"when Captain Casneau and Samuel Badger, the only survivors, were taken"
edgarallanpoe,"off the wreck by the Fame, of Hull, Captain Featherstone, bound home"
edgarallanpoe,"from Rio Janeiro. When picked up, they were in latitude 28 degrees N.,"
edgarallanpoe,"longitude 13 degrees W., having drifted above two thousand miles! On the"
edgarallanpoe,"ninth of July the Fame fell in with the brig Dromero, Captain Perkins,"
edgarallanpoe,who landed the two sufferers in Kennebeck. The narrative from which we
edgarallanpoe,gather these details ends in the following words:
edgarallanpoe,"“It is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast distance,"
edgarallanpoe,"upon the most frequented part of the Atlantic, and not be discovered all"
edgarallanpoe,"this time. They were passed by more than a dozen sail, one of which came"
edgarallanpoe,so nigh them that they could distinctly see the people on deck and on
edgarallanpoe,"the rigging looking at them; but, to the inexpressible disappointment of"
edgarallanpoe,"the starving and freezing men, they stifled the dictates of compassion,"
edgarallanpoe,"hoisted sail, and cruelly abandoned them to their fate.”"
edgarallanpoe,{*3} Among the vessels which at various times have professed to meet
edgarallanpoe,"with the Auroras may be mentioned the ship San Miguel, in 1769; the ship"
edgarallanpoe,"Aurora, in 1774; the brig Pearl, in 1779; and the ship Dolores, in 1790."
edgarallanpoe,They all agree in giving the mean latitude fifty-three degrees south.
edgarallanpoe,"{*4} The terms morning and evening, which I have made use of to avoid"
edgarallanpoe,"confusion in my narrative, as far as possible, must not, of course, be"
edgarallanpoe,taken in their ordinary sense. For a long time past we had had no night
edgarallanpoe,"at all, the daylight being continual. The dates throughout are according"
edgarallanpoe,"to nautical time, and the bearing must be understood as per compass. I"
edgarallanpoe,"would also remark, in this place, that I cannot, in the first portion of"
edgarallanpoe,"what is here written, pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates, or"
edgarallanpoe,"latitudes and longitudes, having kept no regular journal until after"
edgarallanpoe,the period of which this first portion treats. In many instances I have
edgarallanpoe,relied altogether upon memory.
edgarallanpoe,{*5} This day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the south
edgarallanpoe,several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour I have spoken of.
edgarallanpoe,"{*6} The marl was also black; indeed, we noticed no light colored"
edgarallanpoe,substances of any kind upon the island.
edgarallanpoe,{*7}For obvious reasons I cannot pretend to strict accuracy in
edgarallanpoe,these dates. They are given principally with a view to perspicity of
edgarallanpoe,"narrative, and as set down in my pencil memorandum."
edgarallanpoe,LIGEIA
edgarallanpoe,"And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries"
edgarallanpoe,"of the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all"
edgarallanpoe,things by nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield himself to the
edgarallanpoe,"angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his"
edgarallanpoe,feeble will.--Joseph Glanvill.
edgarallanpoe,"I cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where,"
edgarallanpoe,I first became acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long years have since
edgarallanpoe,"elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering. Or, perhaps, I"
edgarallanpoe,"cannot now bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the character"
edgarallanpoe,"of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular yet placid cast of"
edgarallanpoe,"beauty, and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical"
edgarallanpoe,"language, made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and"
edgarallanpoe,stealthily progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown. Yet
edgarallanpoe,"I believe that I met her first and most frequently in some large, old,"
edgarallanpoe,decaying city near the Rhine. Of her family--I have surely heard her
edgarallanpoe,speak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia!
edgarallanpoe,Ligeia! in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden
edgarallanpoe,"impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word alone--by"
edgarallanpoe,Ligeia--that I bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is
edgarallanpoe,"no more. And now, while I write, a recollection flashes upon me that"
edgarallanpoe,I have never known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my
edgarallanpoe,"betrothed, and who became the partner of my studies, and finally the"
edgarallanpoe,wife of my bosom. Was it a playful charge on the part of my Ligeia? or
edgarallanpoe,"was it a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute"
edgarallanpoe,no inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own--a
edgarallanpoe,wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion?
edgarallanpoe,I but indistinctly recall the fact itself--what wonder that I have
edgarallanpoe,utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it?
edgarallanpoe,"And, indeed, if ever she, the wan and the misty-winged Ashtophet of"
edgarallanpoe,"idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell, over marriages ill-omened,"
edgarallanpoe,then most surely she presided over mine.
edgarallanpoe,"There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. It is"
edgarallanpoe,"the person of Ligeia. In stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and, in"
edgarallanpoe,"her latter days, even emaciated. I would in vain attempt to portray"
edgarallanpoe,"the majesty, the quiet ease, of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible"
edgarallanpoe,lightness and elasticity of her footfall. She came and departed as a
edgarallanpoe,shadow. I was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save
edgarallanpoe,"by the dear music of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand"
edgarallanpoe,upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. It was
edgarallanpoe,the radiance of an opium-dream--an airy and spirit-lifting vision
edgarallanpoe,more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered vision about the
edgarallanpoe,slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were not of
edgarallanpoe,that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the
edgarallanpoe,"classical labors of the heathen. “There is no exquisite beauty,” says"
edgarallanpoe,"Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and genera of"
edgarallanpoe,"beauty, “without some strangeness in the proportion.” Yet, although I saw"
edgarallanpoe,that the features of Ligeia were not of a classic regularity--although
edgarallanpoe,"I perceived that her loveliness was indeed “exquisite,” and felt that"
edgarallanpoe,"there was much of “strangeness” pervading it, yet I have tried in vain"
edgarallanpoe,to detect the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of “the
edgarallanpoe,strange.” I examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead--it
edgarallanpoe,was faultless--how cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so
edgarallanpoe,"divine!--the skin rivalling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and"
edgarallanpoe,"repose, the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples; and"
edgarallanpoe,"then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling"
edgarallanpoe,"tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet,"
edgarallanpoe,“hyacinthine!” I looked at the delicate outlines of the nose--and
edgarallanpoe,nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the Hebrews had I beheld a
edgarallanpoe,"similar perfection. There were the same luxurious smoothness of surface,"
edgarallanpoe,"the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same"
edgarallanpoe,harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. I regarded the
edgarallanpoe,sweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly--the
edgarallanpoe,"magnificent turn of the short upper lip--the soft, voluptuous slumber"
edgarallanpoe,"of the under--the dimples which sported, and the color which spoke--the"
edgarallanpoe,"teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost startling, every ray of"
edgarallanpoe,"the holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid, yet most"
edgarallanpoe,exultingly radiant of all smiles. I scrutinized the formation of the
edgarallanpoe,"chin--and here, too, I found the gentleness of breadth, the softness"
edgarallanpoe,"and the majesty, the fullness and the spirituality, of the Greek--the"
edgarallanpoe,"contour which the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the"
edgarallanpoe,son of the Athenian. And then I peered into the large eyes of Ligeia.
edgarallanpoe,"For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have been,"
edgarallanpoe,"too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord"
edgarallanpoe,"Verulam alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger than the ordinary"
edgarallanpoe,eyes of our own race. They were even fuller than the fullest of the
edgarallanpoe,gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad. Yet it was only
edgarallanpoe,at intervals--in moments of intense excitement--that this peculiarity
edgarallanpoe,became more than slightly noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was
edgarallanpoe,her beauty--in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps--the beauty of
edgarallanpoe,beings either above or apart from the earth--the beauty of the fabulous
edgarallanpoe,"Houri of the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows,"
edgarallanpoe,"slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The “strangeness,”"
edgarallanpoe,"however, which I found in the eyes, was of a nature distinct from the"
edgarallanpoe,"formation, or the color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must,"
edgarallanpoe,"after all, be referred to the expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind"
edgarallanpoe,whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much
edgarallanpoe,of the spiritual. The expression of the eyes of Ligeia! How for long
edgarallanpoe,"hours have I pondered upon it! How have I, through the whole of a"
edgarallanpoe,"midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! What was it--that something"
edgarallanpoe,more profound than the well of Democritus--which lay far within the
edgarallanpoe,pupils of my beloved? What was it? I was possessed with a passion to
edgarallanpoe,"discover. Those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine orbs!"
edgarallanpoe,"they became to me twin stars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of"
edgarallanpoe,astrologers.
edgarallanpoe,"There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the"
edgarallanpoe,"science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact--never, I"
edgarallanpoe,"believe, noticed in the schools--that, in our endeavors to recall to"
edgarallanpoe,"memory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very"
edgarallanpoe,"verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. And"
edgarallanpoe,"thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of Ligeia’s eyes, have"
edgarallanpoe,I felt approaching the full knowledge of their expression--felt it
edgarallanpoe,approaching--yet not quite be mine--and so at length entirely depart!
edgarallanpoe,"And (strange, oh strangest mystery of all!) I found, in the commonest"
edgarallanpoe,"objects of the universe, a circle of analogies to that expression. I"
edgarallanpoe,"mean to say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia’s beauty passed"
edgarallanpoe,"into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from many"
edgarallanpoe,"existences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt always"
edgarallanpoe,aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not the more
edgarallanpoe,"could I define that sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it."
edgarallanpoe,"I recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a"
edgarallanpoe,"rapidly-growing vine--in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a"
edgarallanpoe,"chrysalis, a stream of running water. I have felt it in the ocean; in"
edgarallanpoe,the falling of a meteor. I have felt it in the glances of unusually aged
edgarallanpoe,"people. And there are one or two stars in heaven--(one especially, a"
edgarallanpoe,"star of the sixth magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the"
edgarallanpoe,large star in Lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made
edgarallanpoe,aware of the feeling. I have been filled with it by certain sounds from
edgarallanpoe,"stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from books. Among"
edgarallanpoe,"innumerable other instances, I well remember something in a volume of"
edgarallanpoe,"Joseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness--who shall"
edgarallanpoe,say?) never failed to inspire me with the sentiment;--“And the will
edgarallanpoe,"therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of the will,"
edgarallanpoe,with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things by
edgarallanpoe,"nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto"
edgarallanpoe,"death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.”"
edgarallanpoe,"Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to trace,"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the English"
edgarallanpoe,moralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia. An intensity in
edgarallanpoe,"thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a result, or at least"
edgarallanpoe,"an index, of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse,"
edgarallanpoe,failed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence.
edgarallanpoe,"Of all the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the"
edgarallanpoe,"ever-placid Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous"
edgarallanpoe,"vultures of stern passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate,"
edgarallanpoe,save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so
edgarallanpoe,"delighted and appalled me--by the almost magical melody, modulation,"
edgarallanpoe,distinctness and placidity of her very low voice--and by the fierce
edgarallanpoe,energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of
edgarallanpoe,utterance) of the wild words which she habitually uttered.
edgarallanpoe,I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense--such as I
edgarallanpoe,have never known in woman. In the classical tongues was she deeply
edgarallanpoe,"proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the"
edgarallanpoe,"modern dialects of Europe, I have never known her at fault. Indeed upon"
edgarallanpoe,"any theme of the most admired, because simply the most abstruse of the"
edgarallanpoe,"boasted erudition of the academy, have I ever found Ligeia at fault? How"
edgarallanpoe,"singularly--how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife has"
edgarallanpoe,"forced itself, at this late period only, upon my attention! I said her"
edgarallanpoe,knowledge was such as I have never known in woman--but where breathes
edgarallanpoe,"the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of"
edgarallanpoe,"moral, physical, and mathematical science? I saw not then what I now"
edgarallanpoe,"clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of Ligeia were gigantic, were"
edgarallanpoe,astounding; yet I was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to
edgarallanpoe,"resign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through the"
edgarallanpoe,chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily
edgarallanpoe,occupied during the earlier years of our marriage. With how vast a
edgarallanpoe,triumph--with how vivid a delight--with how much of all that is
edgarallanpoe,"ethereal in hope--did I feel, as she bent over me in studies but little"
edgarallanpoe,sought--but less known--that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding
edgarallanpoe,"before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I might at"
edgarallanpoe,length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to
edgarallanpoe,be forbidden!
edgarallanpoe,"How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some"
edgarallanpoe,"years, I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves"
edgarallanpoe,and fly away! Without Ligeia I was but as a child groping benighted.
edgarallanpoe,"Her presence, her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many"
edgarallanpoe,mysteries of the transcendentalism in which we were immersed. Wanting
edgarallanpoe,"the radiant lustre of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller"
edgarallanpoe,than Saturnian lead. And now those eyes shone less and less frequently
edgarallanpoe,upon the pages over which I pored. Ligeia grew ill. The wild eyes blazed
edgarallanpoe,with a too--too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the
edgarallanpoe,"transparent waxen hue of the grave, and the blue veins upon the lofty"
edgarallanpoe,forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the gentle
edgarallanpoe,emotion. I saw that she must die--and I struggled desperately in spirit
edgarallanpoe,"with the grim Azrael. And the struggles of the passionate wife were, to"
edgarallanpoe,"my astonishment, even more energetic than my own. There had been much in"
edgarallanpoe,"her stern nature to impress me with the belief that, to her, death would"
edgarallanpoe,have come without its terrors;--but not so. Words are impotent to convey
edgarallanpoe,any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled
edgarallanpoe,with the Shadow. I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle. I would
edgarallanpoe,"have soothed--I would have reasoned; but, in the intensity of her wild"
edgarallanpoe,"desire for life,--for life--but for life--solace and reason were"
edgarallanpoe,"the uttermost folly. Yet not until the last instance, amid the most"
edgarallanpoe,"convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was shaken the external"
edgarallanpoe,placidity of her demeanor. Her voice grew more gentle--grew more
edgarallanpoe,low--yet I would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly
edgarallanpoe,"uttered words. My brain reeled as I hearkened entranced, to a melody"
edgarallanpoe,more than mortal--to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had
edgarallanpoe,never before known.
edgarallanpoe,That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have been
edgarallanpoe,"easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned"
edgarallanpoe,"no ordinary passion. But in death only, was I fully impressed with the"
edgarallanpoe,"strength of her affection. For long hours, detaining my hand, would she"
edgarallanpoe,pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate
edgarallanpoe,devotion amounted to idolatry. How had I deserved to be so blessed by
edgarallanpoe,such confessions?--how had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal
edgarallanpoe,of my beloved in the hour of her making them? But upon this subject
edgarallanpoe,"I cannot bear to dilate. Let me say only, that in Ligeia’s more than"
edgarallanpoe,"womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all unmerited, all unworthily"
edgarallanpoe,"bestowed, I at length recognized the principle of her longing with so"
edgarallanpoe,wildly earnest a desire for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly
edgarallanpoe,away. It is this wild longing--it is this eager vehemence of desire
edgarallanpoe,for life--but for life--that I have no power to portray--no utterance
edgarallanpoe,capable of expressing.
edgarallanpoe,"At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me,"
edgarallanpoe,"peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by"
edgarallanpoe,herself not many days before. I obeyed her.--They were these:
edgarallanpoe,Lo! ‘tis a gala night
edgarallanpoe,Within the lonesome latter years!
edgarallanpoe,"An angel throng, bewinged, bedight"
edgarallanpoe,"In veils, and drowned in tears,"
edgarallanpoe,"Sit in a theatre, to see"
edgarallanpoe,"A play of hopes and fears,"
edgarallanpoe,While the orchestra breathes fitfully
edgarallanpoe,The music of the spheres.
edgarallanpoe,"Mimes, in the form of God on high,"
edgarallanpoe,"Mutter and mumble low,"
edgarallanpoe,And hither and thither fly;
edgarallanpoe,"Mere puppets they, who come and go"
edgarallanpoe,At bidding of vast formless things
edgarallanpoe,"That shift the scenery to and fro,"
edgarallanpoe,Flapping from out their Condor wings
edgarallanpoe,Invisible Wo!
edgarallanpoe,"That motley drama!--oh, be sure"
edgarallanpoe,It shall not be forgot!
edgarallanpoe,"With its Phantom chased forever more,"
edgarallanpoe,"By a crowd that seize it not,"
edgarallanpoe,Through a circle that ever returneth in
edgarallanpoe,"To the self-same spot,"
edgarallanpoe,And much of Madness and more of Sin
edgarallanpoe,And Horror the soul of the plot.
edgarallanpoe,"But see, amid the mimic rout,"
edgarallanpoe,A crawling shape intrude!
edgarallanpoe,A blood-red thing that writhes from out
edgarallanpoe,The scenic solitude!
edgarallanpoe,It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs
edgarallanpoe,"The mimes become its food,"
edgarallanpoe,And the seraphs sob at vermin fangs
edgarallanpoe,In human gore imbued.
edgarallanpoe,Out--out are the lights--out all!
edgarallanpoe,"And over each quivering form,"
edgarallanpoe,"The curtain, a funeral pall,"
edgarallanpoe,"Comes down with the rush of a storm,"
edgarallanpoe,"And the angels, all pallid and wan,"
edgarallanpoe,"Uprising, unveiling, affirm"
edgarallanpoe,"That the play is the tragedy, “Man,”"
edgarallanpoe,And its hero the Conqueror Worm.
edgarallanpoe,"“O God!” half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending"
edgarallanpoe,"her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these"
edgarallanpoe,lines--“O God! O Divine Father!--shall these things be undeviatingly
edgarallanpoe,so?--shall this Conqueror be not once conquered? Are we not part and
edgarallanpoe,parcel in Thee? Who--who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its
edgarallanpoe,"vigor? Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly,"
edgarallanpoe,save only through the weakness of his feeble will.”
edgarallanpoe,"And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to"
edgarallanpoe,"fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed her"
edgarallanpoe,"last sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. I"
edgarallanpoe,"bent to them my ear and distinguished, again, the concluding words of"
edgarallanpoe,"the passage in Glanvill--“Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto"
edgarallanpoe,"death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.”"
edgarallanpoe,"She died;--and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no"
edgarallanpoe,longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and
edgarallanpoe,decaying city by the Rhine. I had no lack of what the world calls
edgarallanpoe,"wealth. Ligeia had brought me far more, very far more than ordinarily"
edgarallanpoe,"falls to the lot of mortals. After a few months, therefore, of weary and"
edgarallanpoe,"aimless wandering, I purchased, and put in some repair, an abbey, which"
edgarallanpoe,"I shall not name, in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of"
edgarallanpoe,"fair England. The gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the"
edgarallanpoe,"almost savage aspect of the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored"
edgarallanpoe,"memories connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of"
edgarallanpoe,utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial
edgarallanpoe,"region of the country. Yet although the external abbey, with its verdant"
edgarallanpoe,"decay hanging about it, suffered but little alteration, I gave way, with"
edgarallanpoe,"a child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating"
edgarallanpoe,"my sorrows, to a display of more than regal magnificence within.--For"
edgarallanpoe,"such follies, even in childhood, I had imbibed a taste and now they came"
edgarallanpoe,"back to me as if in the dotage of grief. Alas, I feel how much even"
edgarallanpoe,of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and
edgarallanpoe,"fantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild"
edgarallanpoe,"cornices and furniture, in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted"
edgarallanpoe,"gold! I had become a bounden slave in the trammels of opium, and my"
edgarallanpoe,labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams. But these
edgarallanpoe,absurdities I must not pause to detail. Let me speak only of that one
edgarallanpoe,"chamber, ever accursed, whither in a moment of mental alienation, I"
edgarallanpoe,led from the altar as my bride--as the successor of the unforgotten
edgarallanpoe,"Ligeia--the fair-haired and blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of"
edgarallanpoe,Tremaine.
edgarallanpoe,There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of
edgarallanpoe,that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me. Where were the
edgarallanpoe,"souls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold,"
edgarallanpoe,"they permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked, a"
edgarallanpoe,maiden and a daughter so beloved? I have said that I minutely remember
edgarallanpoe,the details of the chamber--yet I am sadly forgetful on topics of deep
edgarallanpoe,"moment--and here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic"
edgarallanpoe,"display, to take hold upon the memory. The room lay in a high turret of"
edgarallanpoe,"the castellated abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious"
edgarallanpoe,size. Occupying the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole
edgarallanpoe,"window--an immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice--a single pane,"
edgarallanpoe,"and tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon,"
edgarallanpoe,"passing through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within."
edgarallanpoe,"Over the upper portion of this huge window, extended the trellice-work"
edgarallanpoe,"of an aged vine, which clambered up the massy walls of the turret. The"
edgarallanpoe,"ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and"
edgarallanpoe,elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a
edgarallanpoe,"semi-Gothic, semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess of"
edgarallanpoe,"this melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with long"
edgarallanpoe,"links, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in pattern, and with"
edgarallanpoe,"many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out of them,"
edgarallanpoe,"as if endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession of"
edgarallanpoe,parti-colored fires.
edgarallanpoe,"Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in"
edgarallanpoe,"various stations about--and there was the couch, too--bridal couch--of"
edgarallanpoe,"an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony, with a"
edgarallanpoe,pall-like canopy above. In each of the angles of the chamber stood on
edgarallanpoe,"end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the kings"
edgarallanpoe,"over against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture."
edgarallanpoe,"But in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of"
edgarallanpoe,"all. The lofty walls, gigantic in height--even unproportionably"
edgarallanpoe,"so--were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and"
edgarallanpoe,massive-looking tapestry--tapestry of a material which was found alike
edgarallanpoe,"as a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the"
edgarallanpoe,"ebony bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the"
edgarallanpoe,curtains which partially shaded the window. The material was the richest
edgarallanpoe,"cloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with"
edgarallanpoe,"arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth"
edgarallanpoe,in patterns of the most jetty black. But these figures partook of the
edgarallanpoe,true character of the arabesque only when regarded from a single point
edgarallanpoe,"of view. By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very"
edgarallanpoe,"remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To one"
edgarallanpoe,"entering the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but"
edgarallanpoe,"upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and step by"
edgarallanpoe,"step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself"
edgarallanpoe,surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to
edgarallanpoe,"the superstition of the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the"
edgarallanpoe,monk. The phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial
edgarallanpoe,introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the
edgarallanpoe,draperies--giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.
edgarallanpoe,"In halls such as these--in a bridal chamber such as this--I passed, with"
edgarallanpoe,"the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month of our"
edgarallanpoe,marriage--passed them with but little disquietude. That my wife dreaded
edgarallanpoe,the fierce moodiness of my temper--that she shunned me and loved me but
edgarallanpoe,little--I could not help perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than
edgarallanpoe,otherwise. I loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than
edgarallanpoe,"to man. My memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity of regret!) to"
edgarallanpoe,"Ligeia, the beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed. I revelled"
edgarallanpoe,"in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her"
edgarallanpoe,"ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then, did"
edgarallanpoe,my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own.
edgarallanpoe,In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was habitually fettered in
edgarallanpoe,"the shackles of the drug) I would call aloud upon her name, during the"
edgarallanpoe,"silence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens"
edgarallanpoe,"by day, as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the"
edgarallanpoe,"consuming ardor of my longing for the departed, I could restore her to"
edgarallanpoe,"the pathway she had abandoned--ah, could it be forever?--upon the earth."
edgarallanpoe,"About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the Lady"
edgarallanpoe,"Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was"
edgarallanpoe,slow. The fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and
edgarallanpoe,"in her perturbed state of half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of"
edgarallanpoe,"motions, in and about the chamber of the turret, which I concluded"
edgarallanpoe,"had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the"
edgarallanpoe,phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself. She became at length
edgarallanpoe,"convalescent--finally well. Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second"
edgarallanpoe,more violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from
edgarallanpoe,"this attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogether recovered."
edgarallanpoe,"Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming character, and of more"
edgarallanpoe,"alarming recurrence, defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions"
edgarallanpoe,of her physicians. With the increase of the chronic disease which
edgarallanpoe,"had thus, apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitution to"
edgarallanpoe,"be eradicated by human means, I could not fail to observe a similar"
edgarallanpoe,"increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her"
edgarallanpoe,"excitability by trivial causes of fear. She spoke again, and now more"
edgarallanpoe,"frequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds--of the slight sounds--and"
edgarallanpoe,"of the unusual motions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly"
edgarallanpoe,alluded.
edgarallanpoe,"One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this"
edgarallanpoe,distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. She
edgarallanpoe,"had just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I had been watching,"
edgarallanpoe,"with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her"
edgarallanpoe,"emaciated countenance. I sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon one of"
edgarallanpoe,"the ottomans of India. She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low"
edgarallanpoe,"whisper, of sounds which she then heard, but which I could not hear--of"
edgarallanpoe,"motions which she then saw, but which I could not perceive. The wind was"
edgarallanpoe,"rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I wished to show her"
edgarallanpoe,"(what, let me confess it, I could not all believe) that those almost"
edgarallanpoe,"inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures"
edgarallanpoe,"upon the wall, were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of"
edgarallanpoe,"the wind. But a deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had proved to me"
edgarallanpoe,that my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to
edgarallanpoe,"be fainting, and no attendants were within call. I remembered where"
edgarallanpoe,was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her
edgarallanpoe,"physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it. But, as"
edgarallanpoe,"I stepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances of a"
edgarallanpoe,startling nature attracted my attention. I had felt that some palpable
edgarallanpoe,although invisible object had passed lightly by my person; and I saw
edgarallanpoe,"that there lay upon the golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich"
edgarallanpoe,"lustre thrown from the censer, a shadow--a faint, indefinite shadow of"
edgarallanpoe,angelic aspect--such as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade.
edgarallanpoe,"But I was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and"
edgarallanpoe,"heeded these things but little, nor spoke of them to Rowena. Having"
edgarallanpoe,"found the wine, I recrossed the chamber, and poured out a gobletful,"
edgarallanpoe,which I held to the lips of the fainting lady. She had now partially
edgarallanpoe,"recovered, however, and took the vessel herself, while I sank upon an"
edgarallanpoe,"ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person. It was then that"
edgarallanpoe,"I became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet, and"
edgarallanpoe,"near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as Rowena was in the act"
edgarallanpoe,"of raising the wine to her lips, I saw, or may have dreamed that I"
edgarallanpoe,"saw, fall within the goblet, as if from some invisible spring in the"
edgarallanpoe,"atmosphere of the room, three or four large drops of a brilliant and"
edgarallanpoe,ruby colored fluid. If this I saw--not so Rowena. She swallowed the wine
edgarallanpoe,"unhesitatingly, and I forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which"
edgarallanpoe,"must, after all, I considered, have been but the suggestion of a vivid"
edgarallanpoe,"imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady, by the"
edgarallanpoe,"opium, and by the hour."
edgarallanpoe,"Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately"
edgarallanpoe,"subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the worse"
edgarallanpoe,"took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the third subsequent"
edgarallanpoe,"night, the hands of her menials prepared her for the tomb, and on the"
edgarallanpoe,"fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber"
edgarallanpoe,"which had received her as my bride.--Wild visions, opium-engendered,"
edgarallanpoe,"flitted, shadow-like, before me. I gazed with unquiet eye upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the varying figures of the"
edgarallanpoe,"drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer"
edgarallanpoe,"overhead. My eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of"
edgarallanpoe,"a former night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had"
edgarallanpoe,"seen the faint traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no longer;"
edgarallanpoe,"and breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances to the pallid"
edgarallanpoe,and rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed upon me a thousand memories
edgarallanpoe,"of Ligeia--and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent violence"
edgarallanpoe,"of a flood, the whole of that unutterable wo with which I had regarded"
edgarallanpoe,"her thus enshrouded. The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of"
edgarallanpoe,"bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, I remained gazing"
edgarallanpoe,upon the body of Rowena.
edgarallanpoe,"It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I had"
edgarallanpoe,"taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct,"
edgarallanpoe,startled me from my revery.--I felt that it came from the bed of
edgarallanpoe,ebony--the bed of death. I listened in an agony of superstitious
edgarallanpoe,terror--but there was no repetition of the sound. I strained my vision
edgarallanpoe,to detect any motion in the corpse--but there was not the slightest
edgarallanpoe,"perceptible. Yet I could not have been deceived. I had heard the noise,"
edgarallanpoe,"however faint, and my soul was awakened within me. I resolutely and"
edgarallanpoe,perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body. Many minutes
edgarallanpoe,elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the
edgarallanpoe,"mystery. At length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and"
edgarallanpoe,"barely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks,"
edgarallanpoe,and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids. Through a species of
edgarallanpoe,"unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no"
edgarallanpoe,"sufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease to beat, my"
edgarallanpoe,limbs grow rigid where I sat. Yet a sense of duty finally operated to
edgarallanpoe,restore my self-possession. I could no longer doubt that we had been
edgarallanpoe,precipitate in our preparations--that Rowena still lived. It was
edgarallanpoe,necessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was
edgarallanpoe,altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the
edgarallanpoe,servants--there were none within call--I had no means of summoning them
edgarallanpoe,to my aid without leaving the room for many minutes--and this I could
edgarallanpoe,not venture to do. I therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to call
edgarallanpoe,"back the spirit ill hovering. In a short period it was certain, however,"
edgarallanpoe,that a relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid
edgarallanpoe,"and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the lips"
edgarallanpoe,became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly expression
edgarallanpoe,of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the
edgarallanpoe,surface of the body; and all the usual rigorous illness immediately
edgarallanpoe,supervened. I fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which I had
edgarallanpoe,"been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate"
edgarallanpoe,waking visions of Ligeia.
edgarallanpoe,An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second
edgarallanpoe,time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed. I
edgarallanpoe,listened--in extremity of horror. The sound came again--it was a sigh.
edgarallanpoe,"Rushing to the corpse, I saw--distinctly saw--a tremor upon the lips. In"
edgarallanpoe,"a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly"
edgarallanpoe,teeth. Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which
edgarallanpoe,"had hitherto reigned there alone. I felt that my vision grew dim, that"
edgarallanpoe,my reason wandered; and it was only by a violent effort that I at length
edgarallanpoe,succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had
edgarallanpoe,pointed out. There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the
edgarallanpoe,cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there
edgarallanpoe,was even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady lived; and with
edgarallanpoe,redoubled ardor I betook myself to the task of restoration. I chafed
edgarallanpoe,"and bathed the temples and the hands, and used every exertion which"
edgarallanpoe,"experience, and no little medical reading, could suggest. But in vain."
edgarallanpoe,"Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the"
edgarallanpoe,"expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole"
edgarallanpoe,"body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense"
edgarallanpoe,"rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of"
edgarallanpoe,"that which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb."
edgarallanpoe,"And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia--and again, (what marvel that I"
edgarallanpoe,"shudder while I write,) again there reached my ears a low sob from the"
edgarallanpoe,region of the ebony bed. But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable
edgarallanpoe,"horrors of that night? Why shall I pause to relate how, time after"
edgarallanpoe,"time, until near the period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama of"
edgarallanpoe,revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only into a
edgarallanpoe,sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore the
edgarallanpoe,aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was
edgarallanpoe,succeeded by I know not what of wild change in the personal appearance
edgarallanpoe,of the corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.
edgarallanpoe,"The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had"
edgarallanpoe,"been dead, once again stirred--and now more vigorously than hitherto,"
edgarallanpoe,although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter
edgarallanpoe,"hopelessness than any. I had long ceased to struggle or to move, and"
edgarallanpoe,"remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of"
edgarallanpoe,"violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible,"
edgarallanpoe,"the least consuming. The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more"
edgarallanpoe,vigorously than before. The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy
edgarallanpoe,"into the countenance--the limbs relaxed--and, save that the eyelids were"
edgarallanpoe,"yet pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the"
edgarallanpoe,"grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, I might"
edgarallanpoe,"have dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of"
edgarallanpoe,"Death. But if this idea was not, even then, altogether adopted, I could"
edgarallanpoe,"at least doubt no longer, when, arising from the bed, tottering, with"
edgarallanpoe,"feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in"
edgarallanpoe,"a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into"
edgarallanpoe,the middle of the apartment.
edgarallanpoe,I trembled not--I stirred not--for a crowd of unutterable fancies
edgarallanpoe,"connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure, rushing"
edgarallanpoe,"hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed--had chilled me into stone. I"
edgarallanpoe,stirred not--but gazed upon the apparition. There was a mad disorder
edgarallanpoe,"in my thoughts--a tumult unappeasable. Could it, indeed, be the"
edgarallanpoe,living Rowena who confronted me? Could it indeed be Rowena at all--the
edgarallanpoe,"fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, why"
edgarallanpoe,should I doubt it? The bandage lay heavily about the mouth--but then
edgarallanpoe,might it not be the mouth of the breathing Lady of Tremaine? And the
edgarallanpoe,"cheeks--there were the roses as in her noon of life--yes, these might"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed be the fair cheeks of the living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin,"
edgarallanpoe,"with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?--but had she then"
edgarallanpoe,grown taller since her malady? What inexpressible madness seized me with
edgarallanpoe,"that thought? One bound, and I had reached her feet! Shrinking from my"
edgarallanpoe,"touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements"
edgarallanpoe,"which had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing"
edgarallanpoe,"atmosphere of the chamber, huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; it"
edgarallanpoe,was blacker than the raven wings of the midnight! And now slowly opened
edgarallanpoe,"the eyes of the figure which stood before me. “Here then, at least,”"
edgarallanpoe,"I shrieked aloud, “can I never--can I never be mistaken--these are the"
edgarallanpoe,"full, and the black, and the wild eyes--of my lost love--of the lady--of"
edgarallanpoe,the LADY LIGEIA.”
edgarallanpoe,MORELLA
edgarallanpoe,"Itself, by itself, solely, one everlasting, and single."
edgarallanpoe,PLATO: SYMPOS.
edgarallanpoe,WITH a feeling of deep yet most singular affection I regarded my friend
edgarallanpoe,"Morella. Thrown by accident into her society many years ago, my soul"
edgarallanpoe,"from our first meeting, burned with fires it had never before known; but"
edgarallanpoe,"the fires were not of Eros, and bitter and tormenting to my spirit was"
edgarallanpoe,the gradual conviction that I could in no manner define their unusual
edgarallanpoe,meaning or regulate their vague intensity. Yet we met; and fate bound us
edgarallanpoe,"together at the altar, and I never spoke of passion nor thought of"
edgarallanpoe,"love. She, however, shunned society, and, attaching herself to me alone"
edgarallanpoe,rendered me happy. It is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness to
edgarallanpoe,dream.
edgarallanpoe,"Morella’s erudition was profound. As I hope to live, her talents were of"
edgarallanpoe,"no common order--her powers of mind were gigantic. I felt this, and, in"
edgarallanpoe,"many matters, became her pupil. I soon, however, found that, perhaps"
edgarallanpoe,"on account of her Presburg education, she placed before me a number of"
edgarallanpoe,those mystical writings which are usually considered the mere dross of
edgarallanpoe,"the early German literature. These, for what reason I could not imagine,"
edgarallanpoe,were her favourite and constant study--and that in process of time
edgarallanpoe,"they became my own, should be attributed to the simple but effectual"
edgarallanpoe,influence of habit and example.
edgarallanpoe,"In all this, if I err not, my reason had little to do. My convictions,"
edgarallanpoe,"or I forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by the ideal, nor was"
edgarallanpoe,"any tincture of the mysticism which I read to be discovered, unless I"
edgarallanpoe,"am greatly mistaken, either in my deeds or in my thoughts. Persuaded"
edgarallanpoe,"of this, I abandoned myself implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and"
edgarallanpoe,entered with an unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies.
edgarallanpoe,"And then--then, when poring over forbidden pages, I felt a forbidden"
edgarallanpoe,spirit enkindling within me--would Morella place her cold hand upon my
edgarallanpoe,"own, and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some low, singular"
edgarallanpoe,"words, whose strange meaning burned themselves in upon my memory. And"
edgarallanpoe,"then, hour after hour, would I linger by her side, and dwell upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"music of her voice, until at length its melody was tainted with terror,"
edgarallanpoe,"and there fell a shadow upon my soul, and I grew pale, and shuddered"
edgarallanpoe,"inwardly at those too unearthly tones. And thus, joy suddenly faded into"
edgarallanpoe,"horror, and the most beautiful became the most hideous, as Hinnon became"
edgarallanpoe,Ge-Henna.
edgarallanpoe,It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those disquisitions
edgarallanpoe,"which, growing out of the volumes I have mentioned, formed, for so"
edgarallanpoe,"long a time, almost the sole conversation of Morella and myself. By"
edgarallanpoe,the learned in what might be termed theological morality they will be
edgarallanpoe,"readily conceived, and by the unlearned they would, at all events,"
edgarallanpoe,be little understood. The wild Pantheism of Fichte; the modified
edgarallanpoe,"Paliggenedia of the Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of"
edgarallanpoe,"Identity as urged by Schelling, were generally the points of discussion"
edgarallanpoe,presenting the most of beauty to the imaginative Morella. That identity
edgarallanpoe,"which is termed personal, Mr. Locke, I think, truly defines to consist"
edgarallanpoe,in the saneness of rational being. And since by person we understand an
edgarallanpoe,"intelligent essence having reason, and since there is a consciousness"
edgarallanpoe,"which always accompanies thinking, it is this which makes us all to"
edgarallanpoe,"be that which we call ourselves, thereby distinguishing us from"
edgarallanpoe,"other beings that think, and giving us our personal identity. But the"
edgarallanpoe,"principium indivduationis, the notion of that identity which at death"
edgarallanpoe,"is or is not lost for ever, was to me, at all times, a consideration of"
edgarallanpoe,intense interest; not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of
edgarallanpoe,"its consequences, than from the marked and agitated manner in which"
edgarallanpoe,Morella mentioned them.
edgarallanpoe,"But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my wife’s"
edgarallanpoe,manner oppressed me as a spell. I could no longer bear the touch of her
edgarallanpoe,"wan fingers, nor the low tone of her musical language, nor the lustre"
edgarallanpoe,"of her melancholy eyes. And she knew all this, but did not upbraid; she"
edgarallanpoe,"seemed conscious of my weakness or my folly, and, smiling, called it"
edgarallanpoe,"fate. She seemed also conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the"
edgarallanpoe,gradual alienation of my regard; but she gave me no hint or token of
edgarallanpoe,"its nature. Yet was she woman, and pined away daily. In time the crimson"
edgarallanpoe,"spot settled steadily upon the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale"
edgarallanpoe,"forehead became prominent; and one instant my nature melted into pity,"
edgarallanpoe,"but in, next I met the glance of her meaning eyes, and then my soul"
edgarallanpoe,sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who gazes downward
edgarallanpoe,into some dreary and unfathomable abyss.
edgarallanpoe,Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consuming desire for
edgarallanpoe,the moment of Morella’s decease? I did; but the fragile spirit clung to
edgarallanpoe,"its tenement of clay for many days, for many weeks and irksome months,"
edgarallanpoe,"until my tortured nerves obtained the mastery over my mind, and I grew"
edgarallanpoe,"furious through delay, and, with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days"
edgarallanpoe,"and the hours and the bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and"
edgarallanpoe,"lengthen as her gentle life declined, like shadows in the dying of the"
edgarallanpoe,day.
edgarallanpoe,"But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heaven, Morella"
edgarallanpoe,"called me to her bedside. There was a dim mist over all the earth, and"
edgarallanpoe,"a warm glow upon the waters, and amid the rich October leaves of the"
edgarallanpoe,"forest, a rainbow from the firmament had surely fallen."
edgarallanpoe,"“It is a day of days,” she said, as I approached; “a day of all days"
edgarallanpoe,either to live or die. It is a fair day for the sons of earth and
edgarallanpoe,"life--ah, more fair for the daughters of heaven and death!”"
edgarallanpoe,"I kissed her forehead, and she continued:"
edgarallanpoe,"“I am dying, yet shall I live.”"
edgarallanpoe,“Morella!”
edgarallanpoe,“The days have never been when thou couldst love me--but her whom in
edgarallanpoe,"life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore.”"
edgarallanpoe,“Morella!”
edgarallanpoe,"“I repeat I am dying. But within me is a pledge of that affection--ah,"
edgarallanpoe,"how little!--which thou didst feel for me, Morella. And when my spirit"
edgarallanpoe,"departs shall the child live--thy child and mine, Morella’s. But thy"
edgarallanpoe,days shall be days of sorrow--that sorrow which is the most lasting of
edgarallanpoe,"impressions, as the cypress is the most enduring of trees. For the hours"
edgarallanpoe,"of thy happiness are over and joy is not gathered twice in a life, as"
edgarallanpoe,"the roses of Paestum twice in a year. Thou shalt no longer, then, play"
edgarallanpoe,"the Teian with time, but, being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine,"
edgarallanpoe,"thou shalt bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth, as do the"
edgarallanpoe,Moslemin at Mecca.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Morella!” I cried, “Morella! how knowest thou this?” but she turned"
edgarallanpoe,"away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming over her limbs,"
edgarallanpoe,"she thus died, and I heard her voice no more."
edgarallanpoe,"Yet, as she had foretold, her child, to which in dying she had given"
edgarallanpoe,"birth, which breathed not until the mother breathed no more, her child,"
edgarallanpoe,"a daughter, lived. And she grew strangely in stature and intellect, and"
edgarallanpoe,"was the perfect resemblance of her who had departed, and I loved her"
edgarallanpoe,with a love more fervent than I had believed it possible to feel for any
edgarallanpoe,denizen of earth.
edgarallanpoe,"But, ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened, and"
edgarallanpoe,"gloom, and horror, and grief swept over it in clouds. I said the child"
edgarallanpoe,"grew strangely in stature and intelligence. Strange, indeed, was her"
edgarallanpoe,"rapid increase in bodily size, but terrible, oh! terrible were the"
edgarallanpoe,tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while watching the development
edgarallanpoe,"of her mental being. Could it be otherwise, when I daily discovered"
edgarallanpoe,in the conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the
edgarallanpoe,woman? when the lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy? and
edgarallanpoe,when the wisdom or the passions of maturity I found hourly gleaming from
edgarallanpoe,"its full and speculative eye? When, I say, all this became evident to my"
edgarallanpoe,"appalled senses, when I could no longer hide it from my soul, nor throw"
edgarallanpoe,"it off from those perceptions which trembled to receive it, is it to be"
edgarallanpoe,"wondered at that suspicions, of a nature fearful and exciting, crept in"
edgarallanpoe,"upon my spirit, or that my thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales"
edgarallanpoe,and thrilling theories of the entombed Morella? I snatched from the
edgarallanpoe,"scrutiny of the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore, and"
edgarallanpoe,"in the rigorous seclusion of my home, watched with an agonizing anxiety"
edgarallanpoe,over all which concerned the beloved.
edgarallanpoe,"And as years rolled away, and I gazed day after day upon her holy, and"
edgarallanpoe,"mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her maturing form, day after"
edgarallanpoe,"day did I discover new points of resemblance in the child to her mother,"
edgarallanpoe,the melancholy and the dead. And hourly grew darker these shadows of
edgarallanpoe,"similitude, and more full, and more definite, and more perplexing, and"
edgarallanpoe,more hideously terrible in their aspect. For that her smile was like her
edgarallanpoe,"mother’s I could bear; but then I shuddered at its too perfect identity,"
edgarallanpoe,"that her eyes were like Morella’s I could endure; but then they, too,"
edgarallanpoe,often looked down into the depths of my soul with Morella’s own intense
edgarallanpoe,"and bewildering meaning. And in the contour of the high forehead, and"
edgarallanpoe,"in the ringlets of the silken hair, and in the wan fingers which buried"
edgarallanpoe,"themselves therein, and in the sad musical tones of her speech, and"
edgarallanpoe,"above all--oh, above all, in the phrases and expressions of the dead on"
edgarallanpoe,"the lips of the loved and the living, I found food for consuming thought"
edgarallanpoe,"and horror, for a worm that would not die."
edgarallanpoe,"Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and as yet my daughter"
edgarallanpoe,"remained nameless upon the earth. “My child,” and “my love,” were the"
edgarallanpoe,"designations usually prompted by a father’s affection, and the rigid"
edgarallanpoe,seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse. Morella’s name
edgarallanpoe,died with her at her death. Of the mother I had never spoken to the
edgarallanpoe,"daughter, it was impossible to speak. Indeed, during the brief period of"
edgarallanpoe,"her existence, the latter had received no impressions from the outward"
edgarallanpoe,"world, save such as might have been afforded by the narrow limits of her"
edgarallanpoe,"privacy. But at length the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind,"
edgarallanpoe,"in its unnerved and agitated condition, a present deliverance from the"
edgarallanpoe,terrors of my destiny. And at the baptismal font I hesitated for a name.
edgarallanpoe,"And many titles of the wise and beautiful, of old and modern times, of"
edgarallanpoe,"my own and foreign lands, came thronging to my lips, with many, many"
edgarallanpoe,"fair titles of the gentle, and the happy, and the good. What prompted"
edgarallanpoe,me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead? What demon urged me to
edgarallanpoe,"breathe that sound, which in its very recollection was wont to make ebb"
edgarallanpoe,the purple blood in torrents from the temples to the heart? What fiend
edgarallanpoe,"spoke from the recesses of my soul, when amid those dim aisles, and in"
edgarallanpoe,"the silence of the night, I whispered within the ears of the holy man"
edgarallanpoe,the syllables--Morella? What more than fiend convulsed the features of
edgarallanpoe,"my child, and overspread them with hues of death, as starting at that"
edgarallanpoe,"scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy eyes from the earth to"
edgarallanpoe,"heaven, and falling prostrate on the black slabs of our ancestral vault,"
edgarallanpoe,responded--“I am here!”
edgarallanpoe,"Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds within"
edgarallanpoe,"my ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into my brain."
edgarallanpoe,"Years--years may pass away, but the memory of that epoch never. Nor was"
edgarallanpoe,I indeed ignorant of the flowers and the vine--but the hemlock and the
edgarallanpoe,cypress overshadowed me night and day. And I kept no reckoning of time
edgarallanpoe,"or place, and the stars of my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the"
edgarallanpoe,"earth grew dark, and its figures passed by me like flitting shadows,"
edgarallanpoe,and among them all I beheld only--Morella. The winds of the firmament
edgarallanpoe,"breathed but one sound within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea"
edgarallanpoe,murmured evermore--Morella. But she died; and with my own hands I bore
edgarallanpoe,her to the tomb; and I laughed with a long and bitter laugh as I found
edgarallanpoe,no traces of the first in the channel where I laid the second.--Morella.
edgarallanpoe,A TALE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS
edgarallanpoe,"DURING the fall of the year 1827, while residing near Charlottesville,"
edgarallanpoe,"Virginia, I casually made the acquaintance of Mr. Augustus Bedloe. This"
edgarallanpoe,"young gentleman was remarkable in every respect, and excited in me a"
edgarallanpoe,profound interest and curiosity. I found it impossible to comprehend
edgarallanpoe,him either in his moral or his physical relations. Of his family I could
edgarallanpoe,"obtain no satisfactory account. Whence he came, I never ascertained."
edgarallanpoe,Even about his age--although I call him a young gentleman--there was
edgarallanpoe,something which perplexed me in no little degree. He certainly seemed
edgarallanpoe,young--and he made a point of speaking about his youth--yet there were
edgarallanpoe,moments when I should have had little trouble in imagining him a hundred
edgarallanpoe,years of age. But in no regard was he more peculiar than in his personal
edgarallanpoe,appearance. He was singularly tall and thin. He stooped much. His limbs
edgarallanpoe,were exceedingly long and emaciated. His forehead was broad and low. His
edgarallanpoe,"complexion was absolutely bloodless. His mouth was large and flexible,"
edgarallanpoe,"and his teeth were more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever"
edgarallanpoe,"before seen teeth in a human head. The expression of his smile,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, was by no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had"
edgarallanpoe,no variation whatever. It was one of profound melancholy--of a phaseless
edgarallanpoe,"and unceasing gloom. His eyes were abnormally large, and round like"
edgarallanpoe,"those of a cat. The pupils, too, upon any accession or diminution of"
edgarallanpoe,"light, underwent contraction or dilation, just such as is observed in"
edgarallanpoe,the feline tribe. In moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a
edgarallanpoe,"degree almost inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a"
edgarallanpoe,"reflected but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun; yet"
edgarallanpoe,"their ordinary condition was so totally vapid, filmy, and dull as to"
edgarallanpoe,convey the idea of the eyes of a long-interred corpse.
edgarallanpoe,"These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much annoyance, and"
edgarallanpoe,"he was continually alluding to them in a sort of half explanatory,"
edgarallanpoe,"half apologetic strain, which, when I first heard it, impressed me very"
edgarallanpoe,"painfully. I soon, however, grew accustomed to it, and my uneasiness"
edgarallanpoe,wore off. It seemed to be his design rather to insinuate than directly
edgarallanpoe,"to assert that, physically, he had not always been what he was--that"
edgarallanpoe,a long series of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of
edgarallanpoe,"more than usual personal beauty, to that which I saw. For many years"
edgarallanpoe,"past he had been attended by a physician, named Templeton--an old"
edgarallanpoe,"gentleman, perhaps seventy years of age--whom he had first encountered"
edgarallanpoe,"at Saratoga, and from whose attention, while there, he either received,"
edgarallanpoe,"or fancied that he received, great benefit. The result was that Bedloe,"
edgarallanpoe,"who was wealthy, had made an arrangement with Dr. Templeton, by"
edgarallanpoe,"which the latter, in consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had"
edgarallanpoe,consented to devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the
edgarallanpoe,care of the invalid.
edgarallanpoe,"Doctor Templeton had been a traveller in his younger days, and at Paris"
edgarallanpoe,"had become a convert, in great measure, to the doctrines of Mesmer. It"
edgarallanpoe,was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he had succeeded in
edgarallanpoe,alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and this success had very
edgarallanpoe,naturally inspired the latter with a certain degree of confidence in the
edgarallanpoe,"opinions from which the remedies had been educed. The Doctor, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"like all enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of"
edgarallanpoe,"his pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to induce the sufferer"
edgarallanpoe,"to submit to numerous experiments. By a frequent repetition of these, a"
edgarallanpoe,"result had arisen, which of late days has become so common as to attract"
edgarallanpoe,"little or no attention, but which, at the period of which I write, had"
edgarallanpoe,"very rarely been known in America. I mean to say, that between Doctor"
edgarallanpoe,"Templeton and Bedloe there had grown up, little by little, a very"
edgarallanpoe,"distinct and strongly marked rapport, or magnetic relation. I am not"
edgarallanpoe,"prepared to assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond the"
edgarallanpoe,"limits of the simple sleep-producing power, but this power itself had"
edgarallanpoe,attained great intensity. At the first attempt to induce the magnetic
edgarallanpoe,"somnolency, the mesmerist entirely failed. In the fifth or sixth he"
edgarallanpoe,"succeeded very partially, and after long continued effort. Only at the"
edgarallanpoe,twelfth was the triumph complete. After this the will of the patient
edgarallanpoe,"succumbed rapidly to that of the physician, so that, when I first became"
edgarallanpoe,"acquainted with the two, sleep was brought about almost instantaneously"
edgarallanpoe,"by the mere volition of the operator, even when the invalid was unaware"
edgarallanpoe,"of his presence. It is only now, in the year 1845, when similar miracles"
edgarallanpoe,"are witnessed daily by thousands, that I dare venture to record this"
edgarallanpoe,apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact.
edgarallanpoe,"The temperature of Bedloe was, in the highest degree sensitive,"
edgarallanpoe,"excitable, enthusiastic. His imagination was singularly vigorous and"
edgarallanpoe,creative; and no doubt it derived additional force from the habitual use
edgarallanpoe,"of morphine, which he swallowed in great quantity, and without which he"
edgarallanpoe,would have found it impossible to exist. It was his practice to take
edgarallanpoe,"a very large dose of it immediately after breakfast each morning--or,"
edgarallanpoe,"rather, immediately after a cup of strong coffee, for he ate nothing in"
edgarallanpoe,"the forenoon--and then set forth alone, or attended only by a dog, upon"
edgarallanpoe,a long ramble among the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward
edgarallanpoe,"and southward of Charlottesville, and are there dignified by the title"
edgarallanpoe,of the Ragged Mountains.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon a dim, warm, misty day, toward the close of November, and during"
edgarallanpoe,the strange interregnum of the seasons which in America is termed the
edgarallanpoe,"Indian Summer, Mr. Bedloe departed as usual for the hills. The day"
edgarallanpoe,"passed, and still he did not return."
edgarallanpoe,"About eight o’clock at night, having become seriously alarmed at his"
edgarallanpoe,"protracted absence, we were about setting out in search of him, when he"
edgarallanpoe,"unexpectedly made his appearance, in health no worse than usual, and"
edgarallanpoe,in rather more than ordinary spirits. The account which he gave of his
edgarallanpoe,"expedition, and of the events which had detained him, was a singular one"
edgarallanpoe,indeed.
edgarallanpoe,"“You will remember,” said he, “that it was about nine in the morning"
edgarallanpoe,when I left Charlottesville. I bent my steps immediately to the
edgarallanpoe,"mountains, and, about ten, entered a gorge which was entirely new to"
edgarallanpoe,me. I followed the windings of this pass with much interest. The scenery
edgarallanpoe,"which presented itself on all sides, although scarcely entitled to be"
edgarallanpoe,"called grand, had about it an indescribable and to me a delicious aspect"
edgarallanpoe,of dreary desolation. The solitude seemed absolutely virgin. I could not
edgarallanpoe,help believing that the green sods and the gray rocks upon which I trod
edgarallanpoe,had been trodden never before by the foot of a human being. So
edgarallanpoe,"entirely secluded, and in fact inaccessible, except through a series"
edgarallanpoe,"of accidents, is the entrance of the ravine, that it is by no means"
edgarallanpoe,impossible that I was indeed the first adventurer--the very first and
edgarallanpoe,sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses.
edgarallanpoe,"“The thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distinguishes the Indian"
edgarallanpoe,"Summer, and which now hung heavily over all objects, served, no doubt,"
edgarallanpoe,to deepen the vague impressions which these objects created. So dense
edgarallanpoe,was this pleasant fog that I could at no time see more than a dozen
edgarallanpoe,"yards of the path before me. This path was excessively sinuous, and"
edgarallanpoe,"as the sun could not be seen, I soon lost all idea of the direction"
edgarallanpoe,in which I journeyed. In the meantime the morphine had its customary
edgarallanpoe,effect--that of enduing all the external world with an intensity of
edgarallanpoe,interest. In the quivering of a leaf--in the hue of a blade of grass--in
edgarallanpoe,the shape of a trefoil--in the humming of a bee--in the gleaming of a
edgarallanpoe,dew-drop--in the breathing of the wind--in the faint odors that came
edgarallanpoe,from the forest--there came a whole universe of suggestion--a gay and
edgarallanpoe,motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought.
edgarallanpoe,"“Busied in this, I walked on for several hours, during which the mist"
edgarallanpoe,deepened around me to so great an extent that at length I was reduced
edgarallanpoe,to an absolute groping of the way. And now an indescribable uneasiness
edgarallanpoe,possessed me--a species of nervous hesitation and tremor. I feared to
edgarallanpoe,"tread, lest I should be precipitated into some abyss. I remembered, too,"
edgarallanpoe,"strange stories told about these Ragged Hills, and of the uncouth and"
edgarallanpoe,fierce races of men who tenanted their groves and caverns. A thousand
edgarallanpoe,vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me--fancies the more
edgarallanpoe,distressing because vague. Very suddenly my attention was arrested by
edgarallanpoe,the loud beating of a drum.
edgarallanpoe,"“My amazement was, of course, extreme. A drum in these hills was a thing"
edgarallanpoe,unknown. I could not have been more surprised at the sound of the trump
edgarallanpoe,of the Archangel. But a new and still more astounding source of interest
edgarallanpoe,"and perplexity arose. There came a wild rattling or jingling sound, as"
edgarallanpoe,"if of a bunch of large keys, and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and"
edgarallanpoe,half-naked man rushed past me with a shriek. He came so close to my
edgarallanpoe,person that I felt his hot breath upon my face. He bore in one hand
edgarallanpoe,"an instrument composed of an assemblage of steel rings, and shook them"
edgarallanpoe,"vigorously as he ran. Scarcely had he disappeared in the mist before,"
edgarallanpoe,"panting after him, with open mouth and glaring eyes, there darted a huge"
edgarallanpoe,beast. I could not be mistaken in its character. It was a hyena.
edgarallanpoe,“The sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my
edgarallanpoe,"terrors--for I now made sure that I dreamed, and endeavored to arouse"
edgarallanpoe,myself to waking consciousness. I stepped boldly and briskly forward.
edgarallanpoe,I rubbed my eyes. I called aloud. I pinched my limbs. A small spring of
edgarallanpoe,"water presented itself to my view, and here, stooping, I bathed my hands"
edgarallanpoe,and my head and neck. This seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations
edgarallanpoe,"which had hitherto annoyed me. I arose, as I thought, a new man, and"
edgarallanpoe,proceeded steadily and complacently on my unknown way.
edgarallanpoe,"“At length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a certain oppressive"
edgarallanpoe,"closeness of the atmosphere, I seated myself beneath a tree. Presently"
edgarallanpoe,"there came a feeble gleam of sunshine, and the shadow of the leaves of"
edgarallanpoe,the tree fell faintly but definitely upon the grass. At this shadow
edgarallanpoe,I gazed wonderingly for many minutes. Its character stupefied me with
edgarallanpoe,astonishment. I looked upward. The tree was a palm.
edgarallanpoe,"“I now arose hurriedly, and in a state of fearful agitation--for the"
edgarallanpoe,fancy that I dreamed would serve me no longer. I saw--I felt that I had
edgarallanpoe,perfect command of my senses--and these senses now brought to my soul
edgarallanpoe,a world of novel and singular sensation. The heat became all at once
edgarallanpoe,"intolerable. A strange odor loaded the breeze. A low, continuous murmur,"
edgarallanpoe,"like that arising from a full, but gently flowing river, came to my"
edgarallanpoe,"ears, intermingled with the peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices."
edgarallanpoe,“While I listened in an extremity of astonishment which I need not
edgarallanpoe,"attempt to describe, a strong and brief gust of wind bore off the"
edgarallanpoe,incumbent fog as if by the wand of an enchanter.
edgarallanpoe,"“I found myself at the foot of a high mountain, and looking down into a"
edgarallanpoe,"vast plain, through which wound a majestic river. On the margin of this"
edgarallanpoe,"river stood an Eastern-looking city, such as we read of in the Arabian"
edgarallanpoe,"Tales, but of a character even more singular than any there described."
edgarallanpoe,"From my position, which was far above the level of the town, I could"
edgarallanpoe,"perceive its every nook and corner, as if delineated on a map. The"
edgarallanpoe,"streets seemed innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in"
edgarallanpoe,"all directions, but were rather long winding alleys than streets, and"
edgarallanpoe,absolutely swarmed with inhabitants. The houses were wildly picturesque.
edgarallanpoe,"On every hand was a wilderness of balconies, of verandas, of minarets,"
edgarallanpoe,"of shrines, and fantastically carved oriels. Bazaars abounded; and"
edgarallanpoe,in these were displayed rich wares in infinite variety and
edgarallanpoe,"profusion--silks, muslins, the most dazzling cutlery, the most"
edgarallanpoe,"magnificent jewels and gems. Besides these things, were seen, on all"
edgarallanpoe,"sides, banners and palanquins, litters with stately dames close veiled,"
edgarallanpoe,"elephants gorgeously caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn, drums,"
edgarallanpoe,"banners, and gongs, spears, silver and gilded maces. And amid the"
edgarallanpoe,"crowd, and the clamor, and the general intricacy and confusion--amid"
edgarallanpoe,"the million of black and yellow men, turbaned and robed, and of flowing"
edgarallanpoe,"beard, there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls, while"
edgarallanpoe,"vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered, chattering and"
edgarallanpoe,"shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or clung to the minarets"
edgarallanpoe,"and oriels. From the swarming streets to the banks of the river, there"
edgarallanpoe,"descended innumerable flights of steps leading to bathing places, while"
edgarallanpoe,the river itself seemed to force a passage with difficulty through the
edgarallanpoe,vast fleets of deeply-burthened ships that far and wide encountered
edgarallanpoe,"its surface. Beyond the limits of the city arose, in frequent majestic"
edgarallanpoe,"groups, the palm and the cocoa, with other gigantic and weird trees of"
edgarallanpoe,"vast age, and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the thatched"
edgarallanpoe,"hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp, or a solitary"
edgarallanpoe,"graceful maiden taking her way, with a pitcher upon her head, to the"
edgarallanpoe,banks of the magnificent river.
edgarallanpoe,"“You will say now, of course, that I dreamed; but not so. What I"
edgarallanpoe,saw--what I heard--what I felt--what I thought--had about it nothing
edgarallanpoe,of the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream. All was rigorously
edgarallanpoe,"self-consistent. At first, doubting that I was really awake, I entered"
edgarallanpoe,"into a series of tests, which soon convinced me that I really was."
edgarallanpoe,"Now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects that he dreams, the"
edgarallanpoe,"suspicion never fails to confirm itself, and the sleeper is almost"
edgarallanpoe,immediately aroused. Thus Novalis errs not in saying that ‘we are near
edgarallanpoe,waking when we dream that we dream.’ Had the vision occurred to me as I
edgarallanpoe,"describe it, without my suspecting it as a dream, then a dream it might"
edgarallanpoe,"absolutely have been, but, occurring as it did, and suspected and tested"
edgarallanpoe,"as it was, I am forced to class it among other phenomena.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“In this I am not sure that you are wrong,” observed Dr. Templeton, “but"
edgarallanpoe,proceed. You arose and descended into the city.”
edgarallanpoe,"“I arose,” continued Bedloe, regarding the Doctor with an air of"
edgarallanpoe,"profound astonishment “I arose, as you say, and descended into the city."
edgarallanpoe,"On my way I fell in with an immense populace, crowding through every"
edgarallanpoe,"avenue, all in the same direction, and exhibiting in every action the"
edgarallanpoe,"wildest excitement. Very suddenly, and by some inconceivable impulse, I"
edgarallanpoe,became intensely imbued with personal interest in what was going on.
edgarallanpoe,"I seemed to feel that I had an important part to play, without exactly"
edgarallanpoe,"understanding what it was. Against the crowd which environed me,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, I experienced a deep sentiment of animosity. I shrank from amid"
edgarallanpoe,"them, and, swiftly, by a circuitous path, reached and entered the city."
edgarallanpoe,"Here all was the wildest tumult and contention. A small party of men,"
edgarallanpoe,"clad in garments half-Indian, half-European, and officered by gentlemen"
edgarallanpoe,"in a uniform partly British, were engaged, at great odds, with the"
edgarallanpoe,"swarming rabble of the alleys. I joined the weaker party, arming myself"
edgarallanpoe,"with the weapons of a fallen officer, and fighting I knew not whom with"
edgarallanpoe,"the nervous ferocity of despair. We were soon overpowered by numbers,"
edgarallanpoe,and driven to seek refuge in a species of kiosk. Here we barricaded
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves, and, for the present were secure. From a loop-hole near the"
edgarallanpoe,"summit of the kiosk, I perceived a vast crowd, in furious agitation,"
edgarallanpoe,surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung the river.
edgarallanpoe,"Presently, from an upper window of this place, there descended an"
edgarallanpoe,"effeminate-looking person, by means of a string made of the turbans of"
edgarallanpoe,"his attendants. A boat was at hand, in which he escaped to the opposite"
edgarallanpoe,bank of the river.
edgarallanpoe,“And now a new object took possession of my soul. I spoke a few hurried
edgarallanpoe,"but energetic words to my companions, and, having succeeded in gaining"
edgarallanpoe,over a few of them to my purpose made a frantic sally from the kiosk.
edgarallanpoe,"We rushed amid the crowd that surrounded it. They retreated, at first,"
edgarallanpoe,"before us. They rallied, fought madly, and retreated again. In the"
edgarallanpoe,"mean time we were borne far from the kiosk, and became bewildered and"
edgarallanpoe,"entangled among the narrow streets of tall, overhanging houses, into"
edgarallanpoe,the recesses of which the sun had never been able to shine. The rabble
edgarallanpoe,"pressed impetuously upon us, harrassing us with their spears, and"
edgarallanpoe,overwhelming us with flights of arrows. These latter were very
edgarallanpoe,"remarkable, and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of the"
edgarallanpoe,"Malay. They were made to imitate the body of a creeping serpent, and"
edgarallanpoe,"were long and black, with a poisoned barb. One of them struck me upon"
edgarallanpoe,the right temple. I reeled and fell. An instantaneous and dreadful
edgarallanpoe,sickness seized me. I struggled--I gasped--I died. “You will hardly
edgarallanpoe,"persist now,” said I smiling, “that the whole of your adventure was not"
edgarallanpoe,a dream. You are not prepared to maintain that you are dead?”
edgarallanpoe,"When I said these words, I of course expected some lively sally from"
edgarallanpoe,"Bedloe in reply, but, to my astonishment, he hesitated, trembled, became"
edgarallanpoe,"fearfully pallid, and remained silent. I looked toward Templeton. He"
edgarallanpoe,"sat erect and rigid in his chair--his teeth chattered, and his eyes were"
edgarallanpoe,starting from their sockets. “Proceed!” he at length said hoarsely to
edgarallanpoe,Bedloe.
edgarallanpoe,"“For many minutes,” continued the latter, “my sole sentiment--my sole"
edgarallanpoe,"feeling--was that of darkness and nonentity, with the consciousness of"
edgarallanpoe,death. At length there seemed to pass a violent and sudden shock through
edgarallanpoe,"my soul, as if of electricity. With it came the sense of elasticity and"
edgarallanpoe,of light. This latter I felt--not saw. In an instant I seemed to rise
edgarallanpoe,"from the ground. But I had no bodily, no visible, audible, or palpable"
edgarallanpoe,presence. The crowd had departed. The tumult had ceased. The city was
edgarallanpoe,"in comparative repose. Beneath me lay my corpse, with the arrow in my"
edgarallanpoe,"temple, the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured. But all these"
edgarallanpoe,things I felt--not saw. I took interest in nothing. Even the corpse
edgarallanpoe,"seemed a matter in which I had no concern. Volition I had none, but"
edgarallanpoe,"appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted buoyantly out of the"
edgarallanpoe,"city, retracing the circuitous path by which I had entered it. When I"
edgarallanpoe,had attained that point of the ravine in the mountains at which I had
edgarallanpoe,"encountered the hyena, I again experienced a shock as of a galvanic"
edgarallanpoe,"battery, the sense of weight, of volition, of substance, returned. I"
edgarallanpoe,"became my original self, and bent my steps eagerly homeward--but the"
edgarallanpoe,"past had not lost the vividness of the real--and not now, even for an"
edgarallanpoe,"instant, can I compel my understanding to regard it as a dream.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Nor was it,” said Templeton, with an air of deep solemnity, “yet it"
edgarallanpoe,would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed. Let us
edgarallanpoe,"suppose only, that the soul of the man of to-day is upon the verge of"
edgarallanpoe,some stupendous psychal discoveries. Let us content ourselves with this
edgarallanpoe,supposition. For the rest I have some explanation to make. Here is a
edgarallanpoe,"watercolor drawing, which I should have shown you before, but which"
edgarallanpoe,an unaccountable sentiment of horror has hitherto prevented me from
edgarallanpoe,showing.”
edgarallanpoe,We looked at the picture which he presented. I saw nothing in it of an
edgarallanpoe,"extraordinary character, but its effect upon Bedloe was prodigious. He"
edgarallanpoe,nearly fainted as he gazed. And yet it was but a miniature portrait--a
edgarallanpoe,"miraculously accurate one, to be sure--of his own very remarkable"
edgarallanpoe,features. At least this was my thought as I regarded it.
edgarallanpoe,"“You will perceive,” said Templeton, “the date of this picture--it"
edgarallanpoe,"is here, scarcely visible, in this corner--1780. In this year was the"
edgarallanpoe,portrait taken. It is the likeness of a dead friend--a Mr. Oldeb--to
edgarallanpoe,"whom I became much attached at Calcutta, during the administration of"
edgarallanpoe,"Warren Hastings. I was then only twenty years old. When I first saw you,"
edgarallanpoe,"Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was the miraculous similarity which existed"
edgarallanpoe,"between yourself and the painting which induced me to accost you,"
edgarallanpoe,"to seek your friendship, and to bring about those arrangements which"
edgarallanpoe,resulted in my becoming your constant companion. In accomplishing this
edgarallanpoe,"point, I was urged partly, and perhaps principally, by a regretful"
edgarallanpoe,"memory of the deceased, but also, in part, by an uneasy, and not"
edgarallanpoe,altogether horrorless curiosity respecting yourself.
edgarallanpoe,“In your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid the
edgarallanpoe,"hills, you have described, with the minutest accuracy, the Indian city"
edgarallanpoe,"of Benares, upon the Holy River. The riots, the combat, the massacre,"
edgarallanpoe,"were the actual events of the insurrection of Cheyte Sing, which took"
edgarallanpoe,"place in 1780, when Hastings was put in imminent peril of his life. The"
edgarallanpoe,man escaping by the string of turbans was Cheyte Sing himself. The party
edgarallanpoe,"in the kiosk were sepoys and British officers, headed by Hastings. Of"
edgarallanpoe,"this party I was one, and did all I could to prevent the rash and fatal"
edgarallanpoe,"sally of the officer who fell, in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned"
edgarallanpoe,arrow of a Bengalee. That officer was my dearest friend. It was Oldeb.
edgarallanpoe,"You will perceive by these manuscripts,” (here the speaker produced a"
edgarallanpoe,"note-book in which several pages appeared to have been freshly written,)"
edgarallanpoe,“that at the very period in which you fancied these things amid the
edgarallanpoe,"hills, I was engaged in detailing them upon paper here at home.”"
edgarallanpoe,"In about a week after this conversation, the following paragraphs"
edgarallanpoe,appeared in a Charlottesville paper:
edgarallanpoe,"“We have the painful duty of announcing the death of Mr. Augustus Bedlo,"
edgarallanpoe,a gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have long endeared
edgarallanpoe,him to the citizens of Charlottesville.
edgarallanpoe,"“Mr. B., for some years past, has been subject to neuralgia, which has"
edgarallanpoe,often threatened to terminate fatally; but this can be regarded only
edgarallanpoe,as the mediate cause of his decease. The proximate cause was one of
edgarallanpoe,"especial singularity. In an excursion to the Ragged Mountains, a few"
edgarallanpoe,"days since, a slight cold and fever were contracted, attended with"
edgarallanpoe,"great determination of blood to the head. To relieve this, Dr. Templeton"
edgarallanpoe,resorted to topical bleeding. Leeches were applied to the temples. In
edgarallanpoe,"a fearfully brief period the patient died, when it appeared that in the"
edgarallanpoe,"jar containing the leeches, had been introduced, by accident, one of"
edgarallanpoe,the venomous vermicular sangsues which are now and then found in the
edgarallanpoe,neighboring ponds. This creature fastened itself upon a small artery in
edgarallanpoe,the right temple. Its close resemblance to the medicinal leech caused
edgarallanpoe,the mistake to be overlooked until too late.
edgarallanpoe,“N. B. The poisonous sangsue of Charlottesville may always be
edgarallanpoe,"distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness, and especially"
edgarallanpoe,"by its writhing or vermicular motions, which very nearly resemble those"
edgarallanpoe,of a snake.”
edgarallanpoe,"I was speaking with the editor of the paper in question, upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"topic of this remarkable accident, when it occurred to me to ask how it"
edgarallanpoe,happened that the name of the deceased had been given as Bedlo.
edgarallanpoe,"“I presume,” I said, “you have authority for this spelling, but I have"
edgarallanpoe,always supposed the name to be written with an e at the end.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Authority?--no,” he replied. “It is a mere typographical error. The"
edgarallanpoe,"name is Bedlo with an e, all the world over, and I never knew it to be"
edgarallanpoe,spelt otherwise in my life.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Then,” said I mutteringly, as I turned upon my heel, “then indeed has"
edgarallanpoe,"it come to pass that one truth is stranger than any fiction--for Bedloe,"
edgarallanpoe,"without the e, what is it but Oldeb conversed! And this man tells me"
edgarallanpoe,that it is a typographical error.”
edgarallanpoe,THE SPECTACLES
edgarallanpoe,"MANY years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of “love at"
edgarallanpoe,"first sight;” but those who think, not less than those who feel deeply,"
edgarallanpoe,"have always advocated its existence. Modern discoveries, indeed, in what"
edgarallanpoe,"may be termed ethical magnetism or magnetoesthetics, render it probable"
edgarallanpoe,"that the most natural, and, consequently, the truest and most intense"
edgarallanpoe,of the human affections are those which arise in the heart as if by
edgarallanpoe,"electric sympathy--in a word, that the brightest and most enduring"
edgarallanpoe,of the psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance. The
edgarallanpoe,confession I am about to make will add another to the already almost
edgarallanpoe,innumerable instances of the truth of the position.
edgarallanpoe,My story requires that I should be somewhat minute. I am still a very
edgarallanpoe,"young man--not yet twenty-two years of age. My name, at present, is a"
edgarallanpoe,very usual and rather plebeian one--Simpson. I say “at present;” for it
edgarallanpoe,is only lately that I have been so called--having legislatively
edgarallanpoe,adopted this surname within the last year in order to receive a large
edgarallanpoe,"inheritance left me by a distant male relative, Adolphus Simpson,"
edgarallanpoe,Esq. The bequest was conditioned upon my taking the name of the
edgarallanpoe,"testator,--the family, not the Christian name; my Christian name is"
edgarallanpoe,"Napoleon Bonaparte--or, more properly, these are my first and middle"
edgarallanpoe,appellations.
edgarallanpoe,"I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance, as in my true"
edgarallanpoe,"patronym, Froissart, I felt a very pardonable pride--believing that"
edgarallanpoe,I could trace a descent from the immortal author of the “Chronicles.”
edgarallanpoe,"While on the subject of names, by the bye, I may mention a singular"
edgarallanpoe,coincidence of sound attending the names of some of my immediate
edgarallanpoe,"predecessors. My father was a Monsieur Froissart, of Paris. His wife--my"
edgarallanpoe,"mother, whom he married at fifteen--was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest"
edgarallanpoe,"daughter of Croissart the banker, whose wife, again, being only sixteen"
edgarallanpoe,"when married, was the eldest daughter of one Victor Voissart. Monsieur"
edgarallanpoe,"Voissart, very singularly, had married a lady of similar name--a"
edgarallanpoe,"Mademoiselle Moissart. She, too, was quite a child when married; and her"
edgarallanpoe,"mother, also, Madame Moissart, was only fourteen when led to the altar."
edgarallanpoe,"These early marriages are usual in France. Here, however, are Moissart,"
edgarallanpoe,"Voissart, Croissart, and Froissart, all in the direct line of descent."
edgarallanpoe,"My own name, though, as I say, became Simpson, by act of Legislature,"
edgarallanpoe,"and with so much repugnance on my part, that, at one period, I actually"
edgarallanpoe,hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying
edgarallanpoe,proviso attached.
edgarallanpoe,"As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient. On the contrary,"
edgarallanpoe,"I believe that I am well made, and possess what nine tenths of the world"
edgarallanpoe,would call a handsome face. In height I am five feet eleven. My hair is
edgarallanpoe,black and curling. My nose is sufficiently good. My eyes are large and
edgarallanpoe,"gray; and although, in fact they are weak a very inconvenient degree,"
edgarallanpoe,still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance.
edgarallanpoe,"The weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I have"
edgarallanpoe,resorted to every remedy--short of wearing glasses. Being youthful and
edgarallanpoe,"good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have resolutely refused to"
edgarallanpoe,"employ them. I know nothing, indeed, which so disfigures the countenance"
edgarallanpoe,"of a young person, or so impresses every feature with an air of"
edgarallanpoe,"demureness, if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age. An"
edgarallanpoe,"eyeglass, on the other hand, has a savor of downright foppery and"
edgarallanpoe,affectation. I have hitherto managed as well as I could without either.
edgarallanpoe,"But something too much of these merely personal details, which, after"
edgarallanpoe,"all, are of little importance. I will content myself with saying,"
edgarallanpoe,"in addition, that my temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent,"
edgarallanpoe,enthusiastic--and that all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the
edgarallanpoe,women.
edgarallanpoe,"One night last winter I entered a box at the P---Theatre, in company"
edgarallanpoe,"with a friend, Mr. Talbot. It was an opera night, and the bills"
edgarallanpoe,"presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was excessively"
edgarallanpoe,"crowded. We were in time, however, to obtain the front seats which had"
edgarallanpoe,"been reserved for us, and into which, with some little difficulty, we"
edgarallanpoe,elbowed our way.
edgarallanpoe,"For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his"
edgarallanpoe,"undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused myself"
edgarallanpoe,"by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very"
edgarallanpoe,"elite of the city. Having satisfied myself upon this point, I was about"
edgarallanpoe,"turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they were arrested and"
edgarallanpoe,riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes which had escaped my
edgarallanpoe,observation.
edgarallanpoe,"If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the intense emotion"
edgarallanpoe,"with which I regarded this figure. It was that of a female, the most"
edgarallanpoe,exquisite I had ever beheld. The face was so far turned toward the stage
edgarallanpoe,"that, for some minutes, I could not obtain a view of it--but the form"
edgarallanpoe,was divine; no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent
edgarallanpoe,proportion--and even the term “divine” seems ridiculously feeble as I
edgarallanpoe,write it.
edgarallanpoe,The magic of a lovely form in woman--the necromancy of female
edgarallanpoe,gracefulness--was always a power which I had found it impossible to
edgarallanpoe,"resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau ideal of my"
edgarallanpoe,"wildest and most enthusiastic visions. The figure, almost all of which"
edgarallanpoe,"the construction of the box permitted to be seen, was somewhat above the"
edgarallanpoe,"medium height, and nearly approached, without positively reaching, the"
edgarallanpoe,majestic. Its perfect fullness and tournure were delicious. The head of
edgarallanpoe,"which only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek"
edgarallanpoe,"Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of"
edgarallanpoe,"gaze aerienne, which put me in mind of the ventum textilem of Apuleius."
edgarallanpoe,"The right arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and thrilled every"
edgarallanpoe,nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry. Its upper portion was
edgarallanpoe,draperied by one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion. This extended
edgarallanpoe,but little below the elbow. Beneath it was worn an under one of some
edgarallanpoe,"frail material, close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of rich lace,"
edgarallanpoe,"which fell gracefully over the top of the hand, revealing only the"
edgarallanpoe,"delicate fingers, upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I"
edgarallanpoe,at once saw was of extraordinary value. The admirable roundness of the
edgarallanpoe,"wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also"
edgarallanpoe,"was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of jewels--telling,"
edgarallanpoe,"in words that could not be mistaken, at once of the wealth and"
edgarallanpoe,fastidious taste of the wearer.
edgarallanpoe,"I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as if I"
edgarallanpoe,"had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this period, I felt"
edgarallanpoe,the full force and truth of all that has been said or sung concerning
edgarallanpoe,“love at first sight.” My feelings were totally different from any which
edgarallanpoe,"I had hitherto experienced, in the presence of even the most celebrated"
edgarallanpoe,"specimens of female loveliness. An unaccountable, and what I am"
edgarallanpoe,"compelled to consider a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to"
edgarallanpoe,"rivet, not only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling,"
edgarallanpoe,upon the admirable object before me. I saw--I felt--I knew that I was
edgarallanpoe,"deeply, madly, irrevocably in love--and this even before seeing the face"
edgarallanpoe,"of the person beloved. So intense, indeed, was the passion that consumed"
edgarallanpoe,"me, that I really believe it would have received little if any abatement"
edgarallanpoe,"had the features, yet unseen, proved of merely ordinary character, so"
edgarallanpoe,anomalous is the nature of the only true love--of the love at first
edgarallanpoe,sight--and so little really dependent is it upon the external conditions
edgarallanpoe,which only seem to create and control it.
edgarallanpoe,"While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a sudden"
edgarallanpoe,disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially
edgarallanpoe,"toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the face. Its beauty"
edgarallanpoe,even exceeded my anticipations--and yet there was something about it
edgarallanpoe,which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it
edgarallanpoe,"was. I said “disappointed,” but this is not altogether the word. My"
edgarallanpoe,sentiments were at once quieted and exalted. They partook less of
edgarallanpoe,transport and more of calm enthusiasm of enthusiastic repose. This state
edgarallanpoe,"of feeling arose, perhaps, from the Madonna-like and matronly air of"
edgarallanpoe,the face; and yet I at once understood that it could not have arisen
edgarallanpoe,entirely from this. There was something else--some mystery which I
edgarallanpoe,could not develope--some expression about the countenance which slightly
edgarallanpoe,"disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest. In fact, I was"
edgarallanpoe,just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible
edgarallanpoe,"man for any act of extravagance. Had the lady been alone, I should"
edgarallanpoe,"undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards; but,"
edgarallanpoe,"fortunately, she was attended by two companions--a gentleman, and a"
edgarallanpoe,"strikingly beautiful woman, to all appearance a few years younger than"
edgarallanpoe,herself.
edgarallanpoe,"I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which I might obtain,"
edgarallanpoe,"hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the present, at"
edgarallanpoe,"all events, a more distinct view of her beauty. I would have removed"
edgarallanpoe,"my position to one nearer her own, but the crowded state of the theatre"
edgarallanpoe,"rendered this impossible; and the stern decrees of Fashion had, of late,"
edgarallanpoe,imperatively prohibited the use of the opera-glass in a case such as
edgarallanpoe,"this, even had I been so fortunate as to have one with me--but I had"
edgarallanpoe,not--and was thus in despair.
edgarallanpoe,At length I bethought me of applying to my companion.
edgarallanpoe,"“Talbot,” I said, “you have an opera-glass. Let me have it.”"
edgarallanpoe,“An opera-glass!--no!--what do you suppose I would be doing with an
edgarallanpoe,opera-glass?” Here he turned impatiently toward the stage.
edgarallanpoe,"“But, Talbot,” I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, “listen to me"
edgarallanpoe,"will you? Do you see the stage--box?--there!--no, the next.--did you"
edgarallanpoe,ever behold as lovely a woman?”
edgarallanpoe,"“She is very beautiful, no doubt,” he said."
edgarallanpoe,“I wonder who she can be?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don’t you know who she is?"
edgarallanpoe,‘Not to know her argues yourself unknown.’ She is the celebrated Madame
edgarallanpoe,"Lalande--the beauty of the day par excellence, and the talk of the"
edgarallanpoe,"whole town. Immensely wealthy too--a widow, and a great match--has just"
edgarallanpoe,arrived from Paris.”
edgarallanpoe,“Do you know her?”
edgarallanpoe,“Yes; I have the honor.”
edgarallanpoe,“Will you introduce me?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Assuredly, with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at B--’s.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can.”"
edgarallanpoe,In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot’s advice; for he
edgarallanpoe,"remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion, and"
edgarallanpoe,occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was
edgarallanpoe,transacting upon the stage.
edgarallanpoe,"In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, and at length"
edgarallanpoe,had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face. It was
edgarallanpoe,"exquisitely lovely--this, of course, my heart had told me before,"
edgarallanpoe,even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the point--but still the
edgarallanpoe,unintelligible something disturbed me. I finally concluded that my
edgarallanpoe,"senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity, sadness, or, still"
edgarallanpoe,"more properly, of weariness, which took something from the youth"
edgarallanpoe,"and freshness of the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic"
edgarallanpoe,"tenderness and majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and"
edgarallanpoe,"romantic temperment, with an interest tenfold."
edgarallanpoe,"While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my great"
edgarallanpoe,"trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the lady,"
edgarallanpoe,"that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze. Still,"
edgarallanpoe,"I was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw it, even for an"
edgarallanpoe,"instant. She turned aside her face, and again I saw only the chiselled"
edgarallanpoe,"contour of the back portion of the head. After some minutes, as if urged"
edgarallanpoe,"by curiosity to see if I was still looking, she gradually brought her"
edgarallanpoe,face again around and again encountered my burning gaze. Her large dark
edgarallanpoe,"eyes fell instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek. But what was my"
edgarallanpoe,astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time
edgarallanpoe,"avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a double"
edgarallanpoe,"eyeglass--elevated it--adjusted it--and then regarded me through it,"
edgarallanpoe,"intently and deliberately, for the space of several minutes."
edgarallanpoe,Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have been more
edgarallanpoe,thoroughly astounded--astounded only--not offended or disgusted in the
edgarallanpoe,slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other woman would
edgarallanpoe,have been likely to offend or disgust. But the whole thing was done with
edgarallanpoe,so much quietude--so much nonchalance--so much repose--with so
edgarallanpoe,"evident an air of the highest breeding, in short--that nothing of"
edgarallanpoe,"mere effrontery was perceptible, and my sole sentiments were those of"
edgarallanpoe,admiration and surprise.
edgarallanpoe,"I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had seemed"
edgarallanpoe,"satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and was withdrawing"
edgarallanpoe,"the instrument, when, as if struck by a second thought, she resumed"
edgarallanpoe,"it, and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of"
edgarallanpoe,"several minutes--for five minutes, at the very least, I am sure."
edgarallanpoe,"This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very"
edgarallanpoe,"general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or buzz,"
edgarallanpoe,"among the audience, which for a moment filled me with confusion, but"
edgarallanpoe,produced no visible effect upon the countenance of Madame Lalande.
edgarallanpoe,"Having satisfied her curiosity--if such it was--she dropped the glass,"
edgarallanpoe,and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her profile now being
edgarallanpoe,"turned toward myself, as before. I continued to watch her unremittingly,"
edgarallanpoe,although I was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing. Presently I
edgarallanpoe,saw the head slowly and slightly change its position; and soon I became
edgarallanpoe,"convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in"
edgarallanpoe,"fact, attentively regarding myself. It is needless to say what effect"
edgarallanpoe,"this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my"
edgarallanpoe,excitable mind.
edgarallanpoe,"Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the fair"
edgarallanpoe,"object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her, and"
edgarallanpoe,"while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of both, that the"
edgarallanpoe,conversation had reference to myself.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned toward the stage, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the performance. At the expiration"
edgarallanpoe,"of this period, however, I was thrown into an extremity of agitation by"
edgarallanpoe,"seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her"
edgarallanpoe,"side, fully confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz"
edgarallanpoe,"of the audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous"
edgarallanpoe,composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul.
edgarallanpoe,"This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever of"
edgarallanpoe,excitement--into an absolute delirium of love--served rather to embolden
edgarallanpoe,"than to disconcert me. In the mad intensity of my devotion, I forgot"
edgarallanpoe,everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision
edgarallanpoe,"which confronted my gaze. Watching my opportunity, when I thought the"
edgarallanpoe,"audience were fully engaged with the opera, I at length caught the eyes"
edgarallanpoe,"of Madame Lalande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable"
edgarallanpoe,bow.
edgarallanpoe,She blushed very deeply--then averted her eyes--then slowly and
edgarallanpoe,"cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had been"
edgarallanpoe,noticed--then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side.
edgarallanpoe,"I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had committed, and"
edgarallanpoe,expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision of pistols
edgarallanpoe,upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain.
edgarallanpoe,"I was greatly and immediately relieved, however, when I saw the lady"
edgarallanpoe,"merely hand the gentleman a play-bill, without speaking, but the reader"
edgarallanpoe,may form some feeble conception of my astonishment--of my profound
edgarallanpoe,"amazement--my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul--when, instantly"
edgarallanpoe,"afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her bright"
edgarallanpoe,"eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with a faint"
edgarallanpoe,"smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct,"
edgarallanpoe,"pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head."
edgarallanpoe,"It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy--upon my transport--upon"
edgarallanpoe,my illimitable ecstasy of heart. If ever man was mad with excess of
edgarallanpoe,"happiness, it was myself at that moment. I loved. This was my first"
edgarallanpoe,love--so I felt it to be. It was love supreme--indescribable. It was
edgarallanpoe,"“love at first sight;” and at first sight, too, it had been appreciated"
edgarallanpoe,and returned.
edgarallanpoe,"Yes, returned. How and why should I doubt it for an instant. What other"
edgarallanpoe,"construction could I possibly put upon such conduct, on the part of a"
edgarallanpoe,lady so beautiful--so wealthy--evidently so accomplished--of so high
edgarallanpoe,breeding--of so lofty a position in society--in every regard so entirely
edgarallanpoe,"respectable as I felt assured was Madame Lalande? Yes, she loved me--she"
edgarallanpoe,"returned the enthusiasm of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind--as"
edgarallanpoe,uncompromising--as uncalculating--as abandoned--and as utterly unbounded
edgarallanpoe,"as my own! These delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now"
edgarallanpoe,interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain. The audience arose; and
edgarallanpoe,"the usual tumult immediately supervened. Quitting Talbot abruptly, I"
edgarallanpoe,made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with Madame
edgarallanpoe,"Lalande. Having failed in this, on account of the crowd, I at length"
edgarallanpoe,"gave up the chase, and bent my steps homeward; consoling myself for"
edgarallanpoe,my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her
edgarallanpoe,"robe, by the reflection that I should be introduced by Talbot, in due"
edgarallanpoe,"form, upon the morrow."
edgarallanpoe,"This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned upon a"
edgarallanpoe,long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours until “one” were
edgarallanpoe,"snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable. But even Stamboul, it is said,"
edgarallanpoe,"shall have an end, and there came an end to this long delay. The clock"
edgarallanpoe,"struck. As the last echo ceased, I stepped into B--‘s and inquired for"
edgarallanpoe,Talbot.
edgarallanpoe,"“Out,” said the footman--Talbot’s own."
edgarallanpoe,"“Out!” I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces--“let me tell"
edgarallanpoe,"you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and"
edgarallanpoe,impracticable; Mr. Talbot is not out. What do you mean?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Nothing, sir; only Mr. Talbot is not in, that’s all. He rode over to"
edgarallanpoe,"S--, immediately after breakfast, and left word that he would not be in"
edgarallanpoe,town again for a week.”
edgarallanpoe,"I stood petrified with horror and rage. I endeavored to reply, but my"
edgarallanpoe,"tongue refused its office. At length I turned on my heel, livid with"
edgarallanpoe,"wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the Talbots to the"
edgarallanpoe,"innermost regions of Erebus. It was evident that my considerate friend,"
edgarallanpoe,"il fanatico, had quite forgotten his appointment with myself--had"
edgarallanpoe,forgotten it as soon as it was made. At no time was he a very scrupulous
edgarallanpoe,man of his word. There was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as
edgarallanpoe,"well as I could, I strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile"
edgarallanpoe,inquiries about Madame Lalande to every male acquaintance I met. By
edgarallanpoe,"report she was known, I found, to all--to many by sight--but she had"
edgarallanpoe,"been in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who"
edgarallanpoe,"claimed her personal acquaintance. These few, being still comparatively"
edgarallanpoe,"strangers, could not, or would not, take the liberty of introducing me"
edgarallanpoe,"through the formality of a morning call. While I stood thus in despair,"
edgarallanpoe,conversing with a trio of friends upon the all absorbing subject of my
edgarallanpoe,"heart, it so happened that the subject itself passed by."
edgarallanpoe,"“As I live, there she is!” cried one."
edgarallanpoe,“Surprisingly beautiful!” exclaimed a second.
edgarallanpoe,“An angel upon earth!” ejaculated a third.
edgarallanpoe,"I looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, passing slowly"
edgarallanpoe,"down the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera, accompanied by"
edgarallanpoe,the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her box.
edgarallanpoe,"“Her companion also wears remarkably well,” said the one of my trio who"
edgarallanpoe,had spoken first.
edgarallanpoe,"“Astonishingly,” said the second; “still quite a brilliant air, but art"
edgarallanpoe,"will do wonders. Upon my word, she looks better than she did at"
edgarallanpoe,"Paris five years ago. A beautiful woman still;--don’t you think so,"
edgarallanpoe,"Froissart?--Simpson, I mean.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Still!” said I, “and why shouldn’t she be? But compared with her friend"
edgarallanpoe,she is as a rush-light to the evening star--a glow-worm to Antares.
edgarallanpoe,"“Ha! ha! ha!--why, Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making"
edgarallanpoe,"discoveries--original ones, I mean.” And here we separated, while one"
edgarallanpoe,"of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville, of which I caught only the"
edgarallanpoe,lines--
edgarallanpoe,"Ninon, Ninon, Ninon a bas--"
edgarallanpoe,A bas Ninon De L’Enclos!
edgarallanpoe,"During this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly to"
edgarallanpoe,"console me, although it fed the passion by which I was consumed. As the"
edgarallanpoe,"carriage of Madame Lalande rolled by our group, I had observed that"
edgarallanpoe,"she recognized me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by the"
edgarallanpoe,"most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, with no equivocal mark of the"
edgarallanpoe,recognition.
edgarallanpoe,"As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of it until"
edgarallanpoe,such time as Talbot should think proper to return from the country. In
edgarallanpoe,the meantime I perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public
edgarallanpoe,"amusement; and, at length, at the theatre, where I first saw her, I had"
edgarallanpoe,"the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her"
edgarallanpoe,"once again. This did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight."
edgarallanpoe,"Every day, in the interim, I had inquired for Talbot at his hotel, and"
edgarallanpoe,every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting “Not
edgarallanpoe,come home yet” of his footman.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a condition little"
edgarallanpoe,"short of madness. Madame Lalande, I had been told, was a Parisian--had"
edgarallanpoe,lately arrived from Paris--might she not suddenly return?--return before
edgarallanpoe,Talbot came back--and might she not be thus lost to me forever? The
edgarallanpoe,thought was too terrible to bear. Since my future happiness was at
edgarallanpoe,"issue, I resolved to act with a manly decision. In a word, upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"breaking up of the play, I traced the lady to her residence, noted the"
edgarallanpoe,"address, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in"
edgarallanpoe,which I poured out my whole heart.
edgarallanpoe,"I spoke boldly, freely--in a word, I spoke with passion. I concealed"
edgarallanpoe,nothing--nothing even of my weakness. I alluded to the romantic
edgarallanpoe,circumstances of our first meeting--even to the glances which had passed
edgarallanpoe,between us. I went so far as to say that I felt assured of her love;
edgarallanpoe,"while I offered this assurance, and my own intensity of devotion, as two"
edgarallanpoe,"excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct. As a third, I spoke of my"
edgarallanpoe,fear that she might quit the city before I could have the opportunity of
edgarallanpoe,a formal introduction. I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle
edgarallanpoe,"ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstances--of my"
edgarallanpoe,affluence--and with an offer of my heart and of my hand.
edgarallanpoe,In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply. After what seemed the
edgarallanpoe,lapse of a century it came.
edgarallanpoe,"Yes, actually came. Romantic as all this may appear, I really received"
edgarallanpoe,"a letter from Madame Lalande--the beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized"
edgarallanpoe,"Madame Lalande. Her eyes--her magnificent eyes, had not belied her"
edgarallanpoe,noble heart. Like a true Frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank
edgarallanpoe,dictates of her reason--the generous impulses of her nature--despising
edgarallanpoe,the conventional pruderies of the world. She had not scorned my
edgarallanpoe,proposals. She had not sheltered herself in silence. She had not
edgarallanpoe,"returned my letter unopened. She had even sent me, in reply, one penned"
edgarallanpoe,by her own exquisite fingers. It ran thus:
edgarallanpoe,“Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle tong of
edgarallanpoe,"his contree so vell as might. It is only de late dat I am arrive, and"
edgarallanpoe,not yet ave do opportunite for to--l’etudier.
edgarallanpoe,"“Vid dis apologie for the maniere, I vill now say dat, helas!--Monsieur"
edgarallanpoe,Simpson ave guess but de too true. Need I say de more? Helas! am I not
edgarallanpoe,ready speak de too moshe?
edgarallanpoe,“EUGENIE LALAND.”
edgarallanpoe,"This noble--spirited note I kissed a million times, and committed, no"
edgarallanpoe,"doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that have now"
edgarallanpoe,escaped my memory. Still Talbot would not return. Alas! could he have
edgarallanpoe,formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned
edgarallanpoe,"his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately"
edgarallanpoe,"to my relief? Still, however, he came not. I wrote. He replied. He was"
edgarallanpoe,detained by urgent business--but would shortly return. He begged me not
edgarallanpoe,to be impatient--to moderate my transports--to read soothing books--to
edgarallanpoe,drink nothing stronger than Hock--and to bring the consolations of
edgarallanpoe,"philosophy to my aid. The fool! if he could not come himself, why, in"
edgarallanpoe,"the name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed me a"
edgarallanpoe,"letter of presentation? I wrote him again, entreating him to forward one"
edgarallanpoe,"forthwith. My letter was returned by that footman, with the following"
edgarallanpoe,endorsement in pencil. The scoundrel had joined his master in the
edgarallanpoe,country:
edgarallanpoe,"“Left S---yesterday, for parts unknown--did not say where--or when be"
edgarallanpoe,"back--so thought best to return letter, knowing your handwriting, and as"
edgarallanpoe,"how you is always, more or less, in a hurry."
edgarallanpoe,"“Yours sincerely,"
edgarallanpoe,“STUBBS.”
edgarallanpoe,"After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the infernal"
edgarallanpoe,"deities both master and valet:--but there was little use in anger, and"
edgarallanpoe,no consolation at all in complaint.
edgarallanpoe,"But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity. Hitherto"
edgarallanpoe,"it had served me well, and I now resolved to make it avail me to the"
edgarallanpoe,"end. Besides, after the correspondence which had passed between us, what"
edgarallanpoe,"act of mere informality could I commit, within bounds, that ought to"
edgarallanpoe,be regarded as indecorous by Madame Lalande? Since the affair of
edgarallanpoe,"the letter, I had been in the habit of watching her house, and thus"
edgarallanpoe,"discovered that, about twilight, it was her custom to promenade,"
edgarallanpoe,"attended only by a negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by"
edgarallanpoe,"her windows. Here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the"
edgarallanpoe,"gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and"
edgarallanpoe,accosted her.
edgarallanpoe,"The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this with the"
edgarallanpoe,assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance. With a presence of mind
edgarallanpoe,"truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the"
edgarallanpoe,most bewitchingly little of hands. The valet at once fell into the
edgarallanpoe,"rear, and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we discoursed long and"
edgarallanpoe,unreservedly of our love.
edgarallanpoe,"As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she wrote it,"
edgarallanpoe,"our conversation was necessarily in French. In this sweet tongue, so"
edgarallanpoe,"adapted to passion, I gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my"
edgarallanpoe,"nature, and, with all the eloquence I could command, besought her to"
edgarallanpoe,consent to an immediate marriage.
edgarallanpoe,At this impatience she smiled. She urged the old story of decorum--that
edgarallanpoe,bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for
edgarallanpoe,bliss has forever gone by. I had most imprudently made it known among my
edgarallanpoe,"friends, she observed, that I desired her acquaintance--thus that I did"
edgarallanpoe,"not possess it--thus, again, there was no possibility of concealing the"
edgarallanpoe,"date of our first knowledge of each other. And then she adverted, with a"
edgarallanpoe,"blush, to the extreme recency of this date. To wed immediately would be"
edgarallanpoe,improper--would be indecorous--would be outre. All this she said with a
edgarallanpoe,charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved and convinced
edgarallanpoe,"me. She went even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness--of"
edgarallanpoe,imprudence. She bade me remember that I really even knew not who she
edgarallanpoe,"was--what were her prospects, her connections, her standing in society."
edgarallanpoe,"She begged me, but with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed"
edgarallanpoe,my love an infatuation--a will o’ the wisp--a fancy or fantasy of the
edgarallanpoe,moment--a baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination
edgarallanpoe,than of the heart. These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet
edgarallanpoe,"twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us--and then, with a"
edgarallanpoe,"gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single sweet"
edgarallanpoe,"instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared."
edgarallanpoe,"I replied as best I could--as only a true lover can. I spoke at length,"
edgarallanpoe,"and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion--of her exceeding"
edgarallanpoe,"beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration. In conclusion, I dwelt,"
edgarallanpoe,"with a convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the course"
edgarallanpoe,of love--that course of true love that never did run smooth--and thus
edgarallanpoe,deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long.
edgarallanpoe,This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her
edgarallanpoe,"determination. She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she said,"
edgarallanpoe,which she felt assured I had not properly considered. This was a
edgarallanpoe,"delicate point--for a woman to urge, especially so; in mentioning it,"
edgarallanpoe,"she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings; still, for me,"
edgarallanpoe,every sacrifice should be made. She alluded to the topic of age. Was I
edgarallanpoe,aware--was I fully aware of the discrepancy between us? That the age
edgarallanpoe,"of the husband, should surpass by a few years--even by fifteen or"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty--the age of the wife, was regarded by the world as admissible,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, indeed, as even proper, but she had always entertained the belief"
edgarallanpoe,that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the
edgarallanpoe,"husband. A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too frequently,"
edgarallanpoe,alas! to a life of unhappiness. Now she was aware that my own age did
edgarallanpoe,"not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the contrary, perhaps, was not"
edgarallanpoe,aware that the years of my Eugenie extended very considerably beyond
edgarallanpoe,that sum.
edgarallanpoe,About all this there was a nobility of soul--a dignity of candor--which
edgarallanpoe,delighted--which enchanted me--which eternally riveted my chains. I
edgarallanpoe,could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me.
edgarallanpoe,"“My sweetest Eugenie,” I cried, “what is all this about which you are"
edgarallanpoe,discoursing? Your years surpass in some measure my own. But what then?
edgarallanpoe,The customs of the world are so many conventional follies. To those who
edgarallanpoe,"love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour? I am"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty-two, you say, granted: indeed, you may as well call me, at once,"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty-three. Now you yourself, my dearest Eugenie, can have"
edgarallanpoe,numbered no more than--can have numbered no more than--no more
edgarallanpoe,than--than--than--than--”
edgarallanpoe,"Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that Madame Lalande"
edgarallanpoe,would interrupt me by supplying her true age. But a Frenchwoman is
edgarallanpoe,"seldom direct, and has always, by way of answer to an embarrassing"
edgarallanpoe,"query, some little practical reply of her own. In the present instance,"
edgarallanpoe,"Eugenie, who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for"
edgarallanpoe,"something in her bosom, at length let fall upon the grass a miniature,"
edgarallanpoe,which I immediately picked up and presented to her.
edgarallanpoe,"“Keep it!” she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles. “Keep it"
edgarallanpoe,for my sake--for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents.
edgarallanpoe,"Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may discover, perhaps, the"
edgarallanpoe,"very information you seem to desire. It is now, to be sure, growing"
edgarallanpoe,rather dark--but you can examine it at your leisure in the morning. In
edgarallanpoe,"the meantime, you shall be my escort home to-night. My friends are"
edgarallanpoe,"about holding a little musical levee. I can promise you, too, some good"
edgarallanpoe,"singing. We French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I"
edgarallanpoe,"shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of an old"
edgarallanpoe,acquaintance.”
edgarallanpoe,"With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home. The mansion was"
edgarallanpoe,"quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste. Of this"
edgarallanpoe,"latter point, however, I am scarcely qualified to judge; for it was just"
edgarallanpoe,dark as we arrived; and in American mansions of the better sort lights
edgarallanpoe,"seldom, during the heat of summer, make their appearance at this, the"
edgarallanpoe,"most pleasant period of the day. In about an hour after my arrival,"
edgarallanpoe,"to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal"
edgarallanpoe,"drawing-room; and this apartment, I could thus see, was arranged with"
edgarallanpoe,"unusual good taste and even splendor; but two other rooms of the suite,"
edgarallanpoe,"and in which the company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole"
edgarallanpoe,"evening, in a very agreeable shadow. This is a well-conceived custom,"
edgarallanpoe,"giving the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our"
edgarallanpoe,friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt.
edgarallanpoe,The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life.
edgarallanpoe,Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends;
edgarallanpoe,and the singing I here heard I had never heard excelled in any private
edgarallanpoe,circle out of Vienna. The instrumental performers were many and of
edgarallanpoe,"superior talents. The vocalists were chiefly ladies, and no individual"
edgarallanpoe,"sang less than well. At length, upon a peremptory call for “Madame"
edgarallanpoe,"Lalande,” she arose at once, without affectation or demur, from the"
edgarallanpoe,"chaise longue upon which she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by"
edgarallanpoe,"one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the"
edgarallanpoe,"piano in the main drawing-room. I would have escorted her myself, but"
edgarallanpoe,"felt that, under the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I"
edgarallanpoe,had better remain unobserved where I was. I was thus deprived of the
edgarallanpoe,"pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing."
edgarallanpoe,The impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical but the
edgarallanpoe,effect upon myself was something even more. I know not how adequately to
edgarallanpoe,"describe it. It arose in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love"
edgarallanpoe,with which I was imbued; but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme
edgarallanpoe,sensibility of the singer. It is beyond the reach of art to endow either
edgarallanpoe,air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers. Her
edgarallanpoe,utterance of the romance in Otello--the tone with which she gave the
edgarallanpoe,"words “Sul mio sasso,” in the Capuletti--is ringing in my memory yet."
edgarallanpoe,Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous. Her voice embraced three
edgarallanpoe,"complete octaves, extending from the contralto D to the D upper soprano,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, though sufficiently powerful to have filled the San Carlos,"
edgarallanpoe,"executed, with the minutest precision, every difficulty of vocal"
edgarallanpoe,"composition--ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri. In"
edgarallanpoe,"the final of the Somnambula, she brought about a most remarkable effect"
edgarallanpoe,at the words:
edgarallanpoe,Ah! non guinge uman pensiero
edgarallanpoe,Al contento ond ‘io son piena.
edgarallanpoe,"Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase of"
edgarallanpoe,"Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, when, by a rapid"
edgarallanpoe,"transition, she struck the G above the treble stave, springing over an"
edgarallanpoe,interval of two octaves.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution, she"
edgarallanpoe,"resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to her, in terms of the"
edgarallanpoe,"deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her performance. Of my surprise I"
edgarallanpoe,"said nothing, and yet was I most unfeignedly surprised; for a certain"
edgarallanpoe,"feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in"
edgarallanpoe,"ordinary conversation, had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing,"
edgarallanpoe,she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability.
edgarallanpoe,"Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and totally"
edgarallanpoe,"unreserved. She made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life,"
edgarallanpoe,and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative. I
edgarallanpoe,concealed nothing--felt that I had a right to conceal nothing--from her
edgarallanpoe,confiding affection. Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of
edgarallanpoe,"her age, I entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of"
edgarallanpoe,"my many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and even"
edgarallanpoe,"of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demanding so"
edgarallanpoe,"much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an evidence of love."
edgarallanpoe,I touched upon my college indiscretions--upon my extravagances--upon my
edgarallanpoe,carousals--upon my debts--upon my flirtations. I even went so far as
edgarallanpoe,"to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time, I had been"
edgarallanpoe,"troubled--of a chronic rheumatism--of a twinge of hereditary gout--and,"
edgarallanpoe,"in conclusion, of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto"
edgarallanpoe,"carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes."
edgarallanpoe,"“Upon this latter point,” said Madame Lalande, laughingly, “you have"
edgarallanpoe,"been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for, without the"
edgarallanpoe,"confession, I take it for granted that no one would have accused you of"
edgarallanpoe,"the crime. By the by,” she continued, “have you any recollection--” and"
edgarallanpoe,"here I fancied that a blush, even through the gloom of the apartment,"
edgarallanpoe,"became distinctly visible upon her cheek--“have you any recollection,"
edgarallanpoe,"mon cher ami of this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my"
edgarallanpoe,neck?”
edgarallanpoe,As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eye-glass
edgarallanpoe,which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera.
edgarallanpoe,"“Full well--alas! do I remember it,” I exclaimed, pressing passionately"
edgarallanpoe,the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection. They
edgarallanpoe,"formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly chased and filigreed, and"
edgarallanpoe,"gleaming with jewels, which, even in the deficient light, I could not"
edgarallanpoe,help perceiving were of high value.
edgarallanpoe,“Eh bien! mon ami” she resumed with a certain empressment of manner that
edgarallanpoe,"rather surprised me--“Eh bien! mon ami, you have earnestly besought of"
edgarallanpoe,me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless. You
edgarallanpoe,have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow. Should I yield to your
edgarallanpoe,"entreaties--and, I may add, to the pleadings of my own bosom--would I"
edgarallanpoe,not be entitled to demand of you a very--a very little boon in return?”
edgarallanpoe,“Name it!” I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the
edgarallanpoe,"observation of the company, and restrained by their presence alone"
edgarallanpoe,"from throwing myself impetuously at her feet. “Name it, my beloved, my"
edgarallanpoe,"Eugenie, my own!--name it!--but, alas! it is already yielded ere named.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“You shall conquer, then, mon ami,” said she, “for the sake of the"
edgarallanpoe,"Eugenie whom you love, this little weakness which you have at last"
edgarallanpoe,"confessed--this weakness more moral than physical--and which, let"
edgarallanpoe,"me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature--so"
edgarallanpoe,"inconsistent with the candor of your usual character--and which, if"
edgarallanpoe,"permitted further control, will assuredly involve you, sooner or later,"
edgarallanpoe,"in some very disagreeable scrape. You shall conquer, for my sake, this"
edgarallanpoe,"affectation which leads you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit"
edgarallanpoe,"or implied denial of your infirmity of vision. For, this infirmity"
edgarallanpoe,"you virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means for its"
edgarallanpoe,"relief. You will understand me to say, then, that I wish you to wear"
edgarallanpoe,"spectacles;--ah, hush!--you have already consented to wear them, for my"
edgarallanpoe,"sake. You shall accept the little toy which I now hold in my hand,"
edgarallanpoe,"and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is really of no very"
edgarallanpoe,"immense value as a gem. You perceive that, by a trifling modification"
edgarallanpoe,"thus--or thus--it can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles,"
edgarallanpoe,or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eye-glass. It is in the former
edgarallanpoe,"mode, however, and habitually, that you have already consented to wear"
edgarallanpoe,it for my sake.”
edgarallanpoe,This request--must I confess it?--confused me in no little degree. But
edgarallanpoe,"the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation, of course,"
edgarallanpoe,a matter altogether out of the question.
edgarallanpoe,"“It is done!” I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could muster at"
edgarallanpoe,the moment. “It is done--it is most cheerfully agreed. I sacrifice
edgarallanpoe,"every feeling for your sake. To-night I wear this dear eye-glass, as an"
edgarallanpoe,"eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning"
edgarallanpoe,"which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife, I will place it"
edgarallanpoe,"upon my--upon my nose,--and there wear it ever afterward, in the less"
edgarallanpoe,"romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable,"
edgarallanpoe,form which you desire.”
edgarallanpoe,Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the
edgarallanpoe,"morrow. Talbot, I learned from my betrothed, had just arrived in town."
edgarallanpoe,"I was to see him at once, and procure a carriage. The soiree would"
edgarallanpoe,scarcely break up before two; and by this hour the vehicle was to be
edgarallanpoe,"at the door, when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the"
edgarallanpoe,"company, Madame L. could easily enter it unobserved. We were then to"
edgarallanpoe,call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be
edgarallanpoe,"married, drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East, leaving"
edgarallanpoe,the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter
edgarallanpoe,it thought best.
edgarallanpoe,"Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went in search of"
edgarallanpoe,"Talbot, but, on the way, I could not refrain from stepping into a hotel,"
edgarallanpoe,for the purpose of inspecting the miniature; and this I did by the
edgarallanpoe,powerful aid of the glasses. The countenance was a surpassingly
edgarallanpoe,beautiful one! Those large luminous eyes!--that proud Grecian
edgarallanpoe,"nose!--those dark luxuriant curls!--“Ah!” said I, exultingly to myself,"
edgarallanpoe,"“this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved!” I turned the reverse,"
edgarallanpoe,and discovered the words--“Eugenie Lalande--aged twenty-seven years and
edgarallanpoe,seven months.”
edgarallanpoe,"I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him with"
edgarallanpoe,"my good fortune. He professed excessive astonishment, of course, but"
edgarallanpoe,"congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every assistance in his"
edgarallanpoe,"power. In a word, we carried out our arrangement to the letter, and, at"
edgarallanpoe,"two in the morning, just ten minutes after the ceremony, I found myself"
edgarallanpoe,"in a close carriage with Madame Lalande--with Mrs. Simpson, I should"
edgarallanpoe,"say--and driving at a great rate out of town, in a direction Northeast"
edgarallanpoe,"by North, half-North."
edgarallanpoe,"It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to be up all"
edgarallanpoe,"night, we should make our first stop at C--, a village about twenty"
edgarallanpoe,"miles from the city, and there get an early breakfast and some repose,"
edgarallanpoe,"before proceeding upon our route. At four precisely, therefore, the"
edgarallanpoe,carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn. I handed my adored
edgarallanpoe,"wife out, and ordered breakfast forthwith. In the meantime we were shown"
edgarallanpoe,"into a small parlor, and sat down."
edgarallanpoe,"It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I gazed,"
edgarallanpoe,"enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all at"
edgarallanpoe,"once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment since my"
edgarallanpoe,"acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of Madame Lalande, that I"
edgarallanpoe,had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all.
edgarallanpoe,"“And now, mon ami,” said she, taking my hand, and so interrupting this"
edgarallanpoe,"train of reflection, “and now, mon cher ami, since we are indissolubly"
edgarallanpoe,"one--since I have yielded to your passionate entreaties, and performed"
edgarallanpoe,my portion of our agreement--I presume you have not forgotten that you
edgarallanpoe,also have a little favor to bestow--a little promise which it is your
edgarallanpoe,intention to keep. Ah! let me see! Let me remember! Yes; full easily do
edgarallanpoe,I call to mind the precise words of the dear promise you made to Eugenie
edgarallanpoe,last night. Listen! You spoke thus: ‘It is done!--it is most cheerfully
edgarallanpoe,agreed! I sacrifice every feeling for your sake. To-night I wear this
edgarallanpoe,"dear eye-glass as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest"
edgarallanpoe,"dawn of that morning which gives me the privilege of calling you wife, I"
edgarallanpoe,"will place it upon my--upon my nose,--and there wear it ever afterward,"
edgarallanpoe,"in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more"
edgarallanpoe,"serviceable, form which you desire.’ These were the exact words, my"
edgarallanpoe,"beloved husband, were they not?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“They were,” I said; “you have an excellent memory; and assuredly,"
edgarallanpoe,"my beautiful Eugenie, there is no disposition on my part to evade the"
edgarallanpoe,performance of the trivial promise they imply. See! Behold! they are
edgarallanpoe,"becoming--rather--are they not?” And here, having arranged the glasses"
edgarallanpoe,"in the ordinary form of spectacles, I applied them gingerly in their"
edgarallanpoe,"proper position; while Madame Simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding"
edgarallanpoe,"her arms, sat bolt upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim,"
edgarallanpoe,"and indeed, in a somewhat undignified position."
edgarallanpoe,"“Goodness gracious me!” I exclaimed, almost at the very instant that the"
edgarallanpoe,rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose--“My goodness gracious
edgarallanpoe,"me!--why, what can be the matter with these glasses?” and taking them"
edgarallanpoe,"quickly off, I wiped them carefully with a silk handkerchief, and"
edgarallanpoe,adjusted them again.
edgarallanpoe,"But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which"
edgarallanpoe,"occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became"
edgarallanpoe,elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was profound--was
edgarallanpoe,"extreme--indeed I may say it was horrific. What, in the name of"
edgarallanpoe,"everything hideous, did this mean? Could I believe my eyes?--could"
edgarallanpoe,I?--that was the question. Was that--was that--was that rouge? And were
edgarallanpoe,"those--and were those--were those wrinkles, upon the visage of Eugenie"
edgarallanpoe,"Lalande? And oh! Jupiter, and every one of the gods and goddesses,"
edgarallanpoe,little and big! what--what--what--what had become of her teeth? I dashed
edgarallanpoe,"the spectacles violently to the ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood"
edgarallanpoe,"erect in the middle of the floor, confronting Mrs. Simpson, with my arms"
edgarallanpoe,"set a-kimbo, and grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly"
edgarallanpoe,speechless with terror and with rage.
edgarallanpoe,"Now I have already said that Madame Eugenie Lalande--that is to say,"
edgarallanpoe,Simpson--spoke the English language but very little better than she
edgarallanpoe,"wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak"
edgarallanpoe,it upon ordinary occasions. But rage will carry a lady to any
edgarallanpoe,extreme; and in the present care it carried Mrs. Simpson to the very
edgarallanpoe,extraordinary extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue
edgarallanpoe,that she did not altogether understand.
edgarallanpoe,"“Vell, Monsieur,” said she, after surveying me, in great apparent"
edgarallanpoe,"astonishment, for some moments--“Vell, Monsieur?--and vat den?--vat de"
edgarallanpoe,matter now? Is it de dance of de Saint itusse dat you ave? If not like
edgarallanpoe,"me, vat for vy buy de pig in the poke?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“You wretch!” said I, catching my breath--“you--you--you villainous old"
edgarallanpoe,hag!”
edgarallanpoe,"“Ag?--ole?--me not so ver ole, after all! Me not one single day more dan"
edgarallanpoe,de eighty-doo.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Eighty-two!” I ejaculated, staggering to the wall--“eighty-two hundred"
edgarallanpoe,thousand baboons! The miniature said twenty-seven years and seven
edgarallanpoe,months!”
edgarallanpoe,“To be sure!--dat is so!--ver true! but den de portraite has been take
edgarallanpoe,"for dese fifty-five year. Ven I go marry my segonde usbande, Monsieur"
edgarallanpoe,"Lalande, at dat time I had de portraite take for my daughter by my first"
edgarallanpoe,"usbande, Monsieur Moissart!”"
edgarallanpoe,“Moissart!” said I.
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes, Moissart,” said she, mimicking my pronunciation, which, to speak"
edgarallanpoe,"the truth, was none of the best,--“and vat den? Vat you know about de"
edgarallanpoe,Moissart?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Nothing, you old fright!--I know nothing about him at all; only I had"
edgarallanpoe,"an ancestor of that name, once upon a time.”"
edgarallanpoe,“Dat name! and vat you ave for say to dat name? ‘Tis ver goot name;
edgarallanpoe,"and so is Voissart--dat is ver goot name too. My daughter, Mademoiselle"
edgarallanpoe,"Moissart, she marry von Monsieur Voissart,--and de name is bot ver"
edgarallanpoe,respectaable name.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Moissart?” I exclaimed, “and Voissart! Why, what is it you mean?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Vat I mean?--I mean Moissart and Voissart; and for de matter of dat, I"
edgarallanpoe,"mean Croissart and Froisart, too, if I only tink proper to mean it."
edgarallanpoe,"My daughter’s daughter, Mademoiselle Voissart, she marry von Monsieur"
edgarallanpoe,"Croissart, and den again, my daughter’s grande daughter, Mademoiselle"
edgarallanpoe,"Croissart, she marry von Monsieur Froissart; and I suppose you say dat"
edgarallanpoe,dat is not von ver respectaable name.-”
edgarallanpoe,"“Froissart!” said I, beginning to faint, “why, surely you don’t say"
edgarallanpoe,"Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes,” she replied, leaning fully back in her chair, and stretching"
edgarallanpoe,"out her lower limbs at great length; “yes, Moissart, and Voissart, and"
edgarallanpoe,"Croissart, and Froissart. But Monsieur Froissart, he vas von ver big vat"
edgarallanpoe,you call fool--he vas von ver great big donce like yourself--for he lef
edgarallanpoe,la belle France for come to dis stupide Amerique--and ven he get here
edgarallanpoe,"he went and ave von ver stupide, von ver, ver stupide sonn, so I hear,"
edgarallanpoe,dough I not yet av ad de plaisir to meet vid him--neither me nor my
edgarallanpoe,"companion, de Madame Stephanie Lalande. He is name de Napoleon"
edgarallanpoe,"Bonaparte Froissart, and I suppose you say dat dat, too, is not von ver"
edgarallanpoe,respectable name.”
edgarallanpoe,"Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of"
edgarallanpoe,working up Mrs. Simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed; and
edgarallanpoe,"as she made an end of it, with great labor, she lumped up from her chair"
edgarallanpoe,"like somebody bewitched, dropping upon the floor an entire universe"
edgarallanpoe,"of bustle as she lumped. Once upon her feet, she gnashed her gums,"
edgarallanpoe,"brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves, shook her fist in my face,"
edgarallanpoe,"and concluded the performance by tearing the cap from her head, and with"
edgarallanpoe,"it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair,"
edgarallanpoe,"the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there"
edgarallanpoe,"trammpled and danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and"
edgarallanpoe,agony of rage.
edgarallanpoe,Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated. “Moissart
edgarallanpoe,"and Voissart!” I repeated, thoughtfully, as she cut one of her"
edgarallanpoe,"pigeon-wings, and “Croissart and Froissart!” as she completed"
edgarallanpoe,another--“Moissart and Voissart and Croissart and Napoleon Bonaparte
edgarallanpoe,"Froissart!--why, you ineffable old serpent, that’s me--that’s me--d’ye"
edgarallanpoe,hear? that’s me”--here I screamed at the top of my voice--“that’s
edgarallanpoe,me-e-e! I am Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart! and if I havn’t married my
edgarallanpoe,"great, great, grandmother, I wish I may be everlastingly confounded!”"
edgarallanpoe,"Madame Eugenie Lalande, quasi Simpson--formerly Moissart--was, in sober"
edgarallanpoe,"fact, my great, great, grandmother. In her youth she had been beautiful,"
edgarallanpoe,"and even at eighty-two, retained the majestic height, the sculptural"
edgarallanpoe,"contour of head, the fine eyes and the Grecian nose of her girlhood. By"
edgarallanpoe,"the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth,"
edgarallanpoe,"and false tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of Paris,"
edgarallanpoe,she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu
edgarallanpoe,"passees of the French metropolis. In this respect, indeed, she might"
edgarallanpoe,have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated Ninon
edgarallanpoe,De L’Enclos.
edgarallanpoe,"She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a widow"
edgarallanpoe,"without children, she bethought herself of my existence in America,"
edgarallanpoe,"and for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit to the United"
edgarallanpoe,"States, in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her"
edgarallanpoe,second husband’s--a Madame Stephanie Lalande.
edgarallanpoe,"At the opera, my great, great, grandmother’s attention was arrested by"
edgarallanpoe,"my notice; and, upon surveying me through her eye-glass, she was struck"
edgarallanpoe,"with a certain family resemblance to herself. Thus interested, and"
edgarallanpoe,"knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the city, she made"
edgarallanpoe,inquiries of her party respecting me. The gentleman who attended her
edgarallanpoe,"knew my person, and told her who I was. The information thus obtained"
edgarallanpoe,induced her to renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so
edgarallanpoe,emboldened me that I behaved in the absurd manner already detailed.
edgarallanpoe,"She returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd"
edgarallanpoe,"accident, I had discovered her identity. When, deceived by my weakness"
edgarallanpoe,"of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the age and charms"
edgarallanpoe,"of the strange lady, I demanded so enthusiastically of Talbot who"
edgarallanpoe,"she was, he concluded that I meant the younger beauty, as a matter"
edgarallanpoe,"of course, and so informed me, with perfect truth, that she was “the"
edgarallanpoe,"celebrated widow, Madame Lalande.”"
edgarallanpoe,"In the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother encountered"
edgarallanpoe,"Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the conversation, very"
edgarallanpoe,naturally turned upon myself. My deficiencies of vision were then
edgarallanpoe,"explained; for these were notorious, although I was entirely ignorant"
edgarallanpoe,"of their notoriety, and my good old relative discovered, much to"
edgarallanpoe,"her chagrin, that she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her"
edgarallanpoe,"identity, and that I had been merely making a fool of myself in making"
edgarallanpoe,"open love, in a theatre, to an old woman unknown. By way of punishing me"
edgarallanpoe,"for this imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot. He purposely kept"
edgarallanpoe,out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction. My street inquiries
edgarallanpoe,"about “the lovely widow, Madame Lalande,” were supposed to refer to"
edgarallanpoe,"the younger lady, of course, and thus the conversation with the three"
edgarallanpoe,gentlemen whom I encountered shortly after leaving Talbot’s hotel will
edgarallanpoe,"be easily explained, as also their allusion to Ninon De L’Enclos. I had"
edgarallanpoe,"no opportunity of seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight; and,"
edgarallanpoe,"at her musical soiree, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses"
edgarallanpoe,effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age. When
edgarallanpoe,"“Madame Lalande” was called upon to sing, the younger lady was intended;"
edgarallanpoe,"and it was she who arose to obey the call; my great, great, grandmother,"
edgarallanpoe,"to further the deception, arising at the same moment and accompanying"
edgarallanpoe,her to the piano in the main drawing-room. Had I decided upon escorting
edgarallanpoe,"her thither, it had been her design to suggest the propriety of my"
edgarallanpoe,remaining where I was; but my own prudential views rendered this
edgarallanpoe,"unnecessary. The songs which I so much admired, and which so confirmed"
edgarallanpoe,"my impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame"
edgarallanpoe,Stephanie Lalande. The eyeglass was presented by way of adding a reproof
edgarallanpoe,to the hoax--a sting to the epigram of the deception. Its presentation
edgarallanpoe,afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which
edgarallanpoe,I was so especially edified. It is almost superfluous to add that the
edgarallanpoe,"glasses of the instrument, as worn by the old lady, had been exchanged"
edgarallanpoe,"by her for a pair better adapted to my years. They suited me, in fact,"
edgarallanpoe,to a T.
edgarallanpoe,"The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a boon"
edgarallanpoe,"companion of Talbot’s, and no priest. He was an excellent “whip,”"
edgarallanpoe,"however; and having doffed his cassock to put on a great-coat, he drove"
edgarallanpoe,the hack which conveyed the “happy couple” out of town. Talbot took a
edgarallanpoe,"seat at his side. The two scoundrels were thus “in at the death,”"
edgarallanpoe,"and through a half-open window of the back parlor of the inn, amused"
edgarallanpoe,themselves in grinning at the denouement of the drama. I believe I shall
edgarallanpoe,be forced to call them both out.
edgarallanpoe,"Nevertheless, I am not the husband of my great, great, grandmother; and"
edgarallanpoe,"this is a reflection which affords me infinite relief,--but I am the"
edgarallanpoe,husband of Madame Lalande--of Madame Stephanie Lalande--with whom my
edgarallanpoe,"good old relative, besides making me her sole heir when she dies--if"
edgarallanpoe,she ever does--has been at the trouble of concocting me a match. In
edgarallanpoe,conclusion: I am done forever with billets doux and am never to be met
edgarallanpoe,without SPECTACLES.

edgarallanpoe,_Buckhurst’s Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex._
edgarallanpoe,"ABOUT twelve o’clock, one night in the month of October, and during the"
edgarallanpoe,"chivalrous reign of the third Edward, two seamen belonging to the crew"
edgarallanpoe,"of the “Free and Easy,” a trading schooner plying between Sluys and the"
edgarallanpoe,"Thames, and then at anchor in that river, were much astonished to find"
edgarallanpoe,themselves seated in the tap-room of an ale-house in the parish of St.
edgarallanpoe,"Andrews, London--which ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a"
edgarallanpoe,“Jolly Tar.”
edgarallanpoe,"The room, although ill-contrived, smoke-blackened, low-pitched, and in"
edgarallanpoe,every other respect agreeing with the general character of such places
edgarallanpoe,"at the period--was, nevertheless, in the opinion of the grotesque groups"
edgarallanpoe,"scattered here and there within it, sufficiently well adapted to its"
edgarallanpoe,purpose.
edgarallanpoe,"Of these groups our two seamen formed, I think, the most interesting, if"
edgarallanpoe,not the most conspicuous.
edgarallanpoe,"The one who appeared to be the elder, and whom his companion addressed"
edgarallanpoe,"by the characteristic appellation of “Legs,” was at the same time much"
edgarallanpoe,"the taller of the two. He might have measured six feet and a half, and"
edgarallanpoe,an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to have been the necessary
edgarallanpoe,"consequence of an altitude so enormous.--Superfluities in height were,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, more than accounted for by deficiencies in other respects."
edgarallanpoe,"He was exceedingly thin; and might, as his associates asserted, have"
edgarallanpoe,"answered, when drunk, for a pennant at the mast-head, or, when sober,"
edgarallanpoe,"have served for a jib-boom. But these jests, and others of a similar"
edgarallanpoe,"nature, had evidently produced, at no time, any effect upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"cachinnatory muscles of the tar. With high cheek-bones, a large"
edgarallanpoe,"hawk-nose, retreating chin, fallen under-jaw, and huge protruding white"
edgarallanpoe,"eyes, the expression of his countenance, although tinged with a species"
edgarallanpoe,"of dogged indifference to matters and things in general, was not the"
edgarallanpoe,less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts at imitation or
edgarallanpoe,description.
edgarallanpoe,"The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the converse of his"
edgarallanpoe,companion. His stature could not have exceeded four feet. A pair
edgarallanpoe,"of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure, while his"
edgarallanpoe,"unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists at their"
edgarallanpoe,"extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a"
edgarallanpoe,"sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no particular color, twinkled far back in his"
edgarallanpoe,head. His nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his
edgarallanpoe,"round, full, and purple face; and his thick upper-lip rested upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"still thicker one beneath with an air of complacent self-satisfaction,"
edgarallanpoe,much heightened by the owner’s habit of licking them at intervals.
edgarallanpoe,"He evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous,"
edgarallanpoe,half-quizzical; and stared up occasionally in his face as the red
edgarallanpoe,setting sun stares up at the crags of Ben Nevis.
edgarallanpoe,"Various and eventful, however, had been the peregrinations of the worthy"
edgarallanpoe,couple in and about the different tap-houses of the neighbourhood during
edgarallanpoe,"the earlier hours of the night. Funds even the most ample, are not"
edgarallanpoe,always everlasting: and it was with empty pockets our friends had
edgarallanpoe,ventured upon the present hostelrie.
edgarallanpoe,"At the precise period, then, when this history properly commences, Legs,"
edgarallanpoe,"and his fellow Hugh Tarpaulin, sat, each with both elbows resting upon"
edgarallanpoe,"the large oaken table in the middle of the floor, and with a hand upon"
edgarallanpoe,"either cheek. They were eyeing, from behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for"
edgarallanpoe,"“humming-stuff,” the portentous words, “No Chalk,” which to their"
edgarallanpoe,indignation and astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of
edgarallanpoe,that very mineral whose presence they purported to deny. Not that the
edgarallanpoe,gift of decyphering written characters--a gift among the commonalty
edgarallanpoe,of that day considered little less cabalistical than the art of
edgarallanpoe,"inditing--could, in strict justice, have been laid to the charge of"
edgarallanpoe,"either disciple of the sea; but there was, to say the truth, a certain"
edgarallanpoe,twist in the formation of the letters--an indescribable lee-lurch about
edgarallanpoe,"the whole--which foreboded, in the opinion of both seamen, a long run"
edgarallanpoe,"of dirty weather; and determined them at once, in the allegorical words"
edgarallanpoe,"of Legs himself, to “pump ship, clew up all sail, and scud before the"
edgarallanpoe,wind.”
edgarallanpoe,"Having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale, and looped up"
edgarallanpoe,"the points of their short doublets, they finally made a bolt for the"
edgarallanpoe,"street. Although Tarpaulin rolled twice into the fire-place, mistaking"
edgarallanpoe,"it for the door, yet their escape was at length happily effected--and"
edgarallanpoe,"half after twelve o’clock found our heroes ripe for mischief, and"
edgarallanpoe,running for life down a dark alley in the direction of St. Andrew’s
edgarallanpoe,"Stair, hotly pursued by the landlady of the “Jolly Tar.”"
edgarallanpoe,"At the epoch of this eventful tale, and periodically, for many years"
edgarallanpoe,"before and after, all England, but more especially the metropolis,"
edgarallanpoe,resounded with the fearful cry of “Plague!” The city was in a great
edgarallanpoe,"measure depopulated--and in those horrible regions, in the vicinity of"
edgarallanpoe,"the Thames, where amid the dark, narrow, and filthy lanes and alleys,"
edgarallanpoe,"the Demon of Disease was supposed to have had his nativity, Awe, Terror,"
edgarallanpoe,and Superstition were alone to be found stalking abroad.
edgarallanpoe,"By authority of the king such districts were placed under ban, and all"
edgarallanpoe,"persons forbidden, under pain of death, to intrude upon their dismal"
edgarallanpoe,"solitude. Yet neither the mandate of the monarch, nor the huge barriers"
edgarallanpoe,"erected at the entrances of the streets, nor the prospect of that"
edgarallanpoe,"loathsome death which, with almost absolute certainty, overwhelmed"
edgarallanpoe,"the wretch whom no peril could deter from the adventure, prevented the"
edgarallanpoe,"unfurnished and untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand"
edgarallanpoe,"of nightly rapine, of every article, such as iron, brass, or lead-work,"
edgarallanpoe,which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account.
edgarallanpoe,"Above all, it was usually found, upon the annual winter opening of the"
edgarallanpoe,"barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret cellars, had proved but"
edgarallanpoe,"slender protection to those rich stores of wines and liquors which, in"
edgarallanpoe,"consideration of the risk and trouble of removal, many of the numerous"
edgarallanpoe,"dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consented to trust, during"
edgarallanpoe,"the period of exile, to so insufficient a security."
edgarallanpoe,But there were very few of the terror-stricken people who attributed
edgarallanpoe,"these doings to the agency of human hands. Pest-spirits, plague-goblins,"
edgarallanpoe,"and fever-demons, were the popular imps of mischief; and tales so"
edgarallanpoe,"blood-chilling were hourly told, that the whole mass of forbidden"
edgarallanpoe,"buildings was, at length, enveloped in terror as in a shroud, and"
edgarallanpoe,the plunderer himself was often scared away by the horrors his own
edgarallanpoe,depreciations had created; leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited
edgarallanpoe,"district to gloom, silence, pestilence, and death."
edgarallanpoe,"It was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned, and which"
edgarallanpoe,"indicated the region beyond to be under the Pest-ban, that, in"
edgarallanpoe,"scrambling down an alley, Legs and the worthy Hugh Tarpaulin found their"
edgarallanpoe,"progress suddenly impeded. To return was out of the question, and no"
edgarallanpoe,"time was to be lost, as their pursuers were close upon their heels. With"
edgarallanpoe,thorough-bred seamen to clamber up the roughly fashioned plank-work
edgarallanpoe,"was a trifle; and, maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise"
edgarallanpoe,"and liquor, they leaped unhesitatingly down within the enclosure, and"
edgarallanpoe,"holding on their drunken course with shouts and yellings, were soon"
edgarallanpoe,bewildered in its noisome and intricate recesses.
edgarallanpoe,"Had they not, indeed, been intoxicated beyond moral sense, their reeling"
edgarallanpoe,footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their situation. The
edgarallanpoe,"air was cold and misty. The paving-stones, loosened from their beds, lay"
edgarallanpoe,"in wild disorder amid the tall, rank grass, which sprang up around the"
edgarallanpoe,feet and ankles. Fallen houses choked up the streets. The most fetid and
edgarallanpoe,poisonous smells everywhere prevailed;--and by the aid of that ghastly
edgarallanpoe,"light which, even at midnight, never fails to emanate from a vapory and"
edgarallanpoe,"pestilential atmosphere, might be discerned lying in the by-paths and"
edgarallanpoe,"alleys, or rotting in the windowless habitations, the carcass of many"
edgarallanpoe,a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in the very
edgarallanpoe,perpetration of his robbery.
edgarallanpoe,"--But it lay not in the power of images, or sensations, or impediments"
edgarallanpoe,"such as these, to stay the course of men who, naturally brave, and at"
edgarallanpoe,"that time especially, brimful of courage and of “humming-stuff!” would"
edgarallanpoe,"have reeled, as straight as their condition might have permitted,"
edgarallanpoe,undauntedly into the very jaws of Death. Onward--still onward stalked
edgarallanpoe,"the grim Legs, making the desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells"
edgarallanpoe,"like the terrific war-whoop of the Indian: and onward, still onward"
edgarallanpoe,"rolled the dumpy Tarpaulin, hanging on to the doublet of his more active"
edgarallanpoe,"companion, and far surpassing the latter’s most strenuous exertions in"
edgarallanpoe,"the way of vocal music, by bull-roarings in basso, from the profundity"
edgarallanpoe,of his stentorian lungs.
edgarallanpoe,They had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence. Their
edgarallanpoe,way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more horrible--the
edgarallanpoe,paths more narrow and more intricate. Huge stones and beams falling
edgarallanpoe,"momently from the decaying roofs above them, gave evidence, by their"
edgarallanpoe,"sullen and heavy descent, of the vast height of the surrounding houses;"
edgarallanpoe,and while actual exertion became necessary to force a passage through
edgarallanpoe,"frequent heaps of rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the hand fell"
edgarallanpoe,upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse.
edgarallanpoe,"Suddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall and"
edgarallanpoe,"ghastly-looking building, a yell more than usually shrill from the"
edgarallanpoe,"throat of the excited Legs, was replied to from within, in a rapid"
edgarallanpoe,"succession of wild, laughter-like, and fiendish shrieks. Nothing daunted"
edgarallanpoe,"at sounds which, of such a nature, at such a time, and in such a place,"
edgarallanpoe,"might have curdled the very blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire,"
edgarallanpoe,"the drunken couple rushed headlong against the door, burst it open, and"
edgarallanpoe,staggered into the midst of things with a volley of curses.
edgarallanpoe,The room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop of
edgarallanpoe,"an undertaker; but an open trap-door, in a corner of the floor near the"
edgarallanpoe,"entrance, looked down upon a long range of wine-cellars, whose depths"
edgarallanpoe,the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed to be well stored
edgarallanpoe,with their appropriate contents. In the middle of the room stood a
edgarallanpoe,table--in the centre of which again arose a huge tub of what appeared
edgarallanpoe,"to be punch. Bottles of various wines and cordials, together with"
edgarallanpoe,"jugs, pitchers, and flagons of every shape and quality, were scattered"
edgarallanpoe,"profusely upon the board. Around it, upon coffin-tressels, was seated a"
edgarallanpoe,company of six. This company I will endeavor to delineate one by one.
edgarallanpoe,"Fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his companions, sat a"
edgarallanpoe,personage who appeared to be the president of the table. His stature was
edgarallanpoe,"gaunt and tall, and Legs was confounded to behold in him a figure"
edgarallanpoe,more emaciated than himself. His face was as yellow as saffron--but
edgarallanpoe,"no feature excepting one alone, was sufficiently marked to merit a"
edgarallanpoe,particular description. This one consisted in a forehead so unusually
edgarallanpoe,"and hideously lofty, as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown"
edgarallanpoe,of flesh superadded upon the natural head. His mouth was puckered and
edgarallanpoe,"dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability, and his eyes, as"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed the eyes of all at table, were glazed over with the fumes"
edgarallanpoe,of intoxication. This gentleman was clothed from head to foot in a
edgarallanpoe,"richly-embroidered black silk-velvet pall, wrapped negligently around"
edgarallanpoe,his form after the fashion of a Spanish cloak.--His head was stuck full
edgarallanpoe,"of sable hearse-plumes, which he nodded to and fro with a jaunty and"
edgarallanpoe,"knowing air; and, in his right hand, he held a huge human thigh-bone,"
edgarallanpoe,with which he appeared to have been just knocking down some member of
edgarallanpoe,the company for a song.
edgarallanpoe,"Opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a lady of no whit the"
edgarallanpoe,less extraordinary character. Although quite as tall as the person just
edgarallanpoe,"described, she had no right to complain of his unnatural emaciation. She"
edgarallanpoe,was evidently in the last stage of a dropsy; and her figure resembled
edgarallanpoe,"nearly that of the huge puncheon of October beer which stood, with the"
edgarallanpoe,"head driven in, close by her side, in a corner of the chamber. Her"
edgarallanpoe,"face was exceedingly round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or"
edgarallanpoe,"rather want of peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which I"
edgarallanpoe,"before mentioned in the case of the president--that is to say, only one"
edgarallanpoe,feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate
edgarallanpoe,characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately observed that
edgarallanpoe,the same remark might have applied to each individual person of the
edgarallanpoe,party; every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular
edgarallanpoe,portion of physiognomy. With the lady in question this portion proved
edgarallanpoe,"to be the mouth. Commencing at the right ear, it swept with a terrific"
edgarallanpoe,chasm to the left--the short pendants which she wore in either auricle
edgarallanpoe,"continually bobbing into the aperture. She made, however, every exertion"
edgarallanpoe,"to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in a dress consisting of a"
edgarallanpoe,"newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close under her chin, with a"
edgarallanpoe,crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin.
edgarallanpoe,At her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared to
edgarallanpoe,"patronise. This delicate little creature, in the trembling of her wasted"
edgarallanpoe,"fingers, in the livid hue of her lips, and in the slight hectic spot"
edgarallanpoe,"which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion, gave evident indications"
edgarallanpoe,"of a galloping consumption. An air of gave extreme haut ton, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"pervaded her whole appearance; she wore in a graceful and degage manner,"
edgarallanpoe,a large and beautiful winding-sheet of the finest India lawn; her hair
edgarallanpoe,hung in ringlets over her neck; a soft smile played about her mouth; but
edgarallanpoe,"her nose, extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible and pimpled, hung down"
edgarallanpoe,"far below her under lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in which"
edgarallanpoe,"she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her tongue, gave"
edgarallanpoe,to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression.
edgarallanpoe,"Over against her, and upon the left of the dropsical lady, was seated a"
edgarallanpoe,"little puffy, wheezing, and gouty old man, whose cheeks reposed upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"shoulders of their owner, like two huge bladders of Oporto wine. With"
edgarallanpoe,"his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg deposited upon the table,"
edgarallanpoe,he seemed to think himself entitled to some consideration. He evidently
edgarallanpoe,"prided himself much upon every inch of his personal appearance, but took"
edgarallanpoe,more especial delight in calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout.
edgarallanpoe,"This, to say the truth, must have cost him no little money, and was made"
edgarallanpoe,to fit him exceedingly well--being fashioned from one of the curiously
edgarallanpoe,embroidered silken covers appertaining to those glorious escutcheons
edgarallanpoe,"which, in England and elsewhere, are customarily hung up, in some"
edgarallanpoe,"conspicuous place, upon the dwellings of departed aristocracy."
edgarallanpoe,"Next to him, and at the right hand of the president, was a gentleman"
edgarallanpoe,"in long white hose and cotton drawers. His frame shook, in a ridiculous"
edgarallanpoe,"manner, with a fit of what Tarpaulin called “the horrors.” His jaws,"
edgarallanpoe,"which had been newly shaved, were tightly tied up by a bandage of"
edgarallanpoe,"muslin; and his arms being fastened in a similar way at the wrists,"
edgarallanpoe,I prevented him from helping himself too freely to the liquors upon the
edgarallanpoe,"table; a precaution rendered necessary, in the opinion of Legs, by"
edgarallanpoe,the peculiarly sottish and wine-bibbing cast of his visage. A pair of
edgarallanpoe,"prodigious ears, nevertheless, which it was no doubt found impossible"
edgarallanpoe,"to confine, towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment, and were"
edgarallanpoe,"occasionally pricked up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing of a"
edgarallanpoe,cork.
edgarallanpoe,"Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singularly"
edgarallanpoe,"stiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis, must,"
edgarallanpoe,"to speak seriously, have felt very ill at ease in his unaccommodating"
edgarallanpoe,"habiliments. He was habited, somewhat uniquely, in a new and handsome"
edgarallanpoe,mahogany coffin. Its top or head-piece pressed upon the skull of the
edgarallanpoe,"wearer, and extended over it in the fashion of a hood, giving to the"
edgarallanpoe,entire face an air of indescribable interest. Arm-holes had been cut in
edgarallanpoe,"the sides, for the sake not more of elegance than of convenience; but"
edgarallanpoe,"the dress, nevertheless, prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect"
edgarallanpoe,"as his associates; and as he lay reclining against his tressel, at an"
edgarallanpoe,"angle of forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their"
edgarallanpoe,awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement at their own
edgarallanpoe,enormity.
edgarallanpoe,"Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was used as"
edgarallanpoe,"a drinking cup. Overhead was suspended a human skeleton, by means of a"
edgarallanpoe,rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring in the ceiling.
edgarallanpoe,"The other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck off from the body at"
edgarallanpoe,"right angles, causing the whole loose and rattling frame to dangle and"
edgarallanpoe,twirl about at the caprice of every occasional puff of wind which found
edgarallanpoe,its way into the apartment. In the cranium of this hideous thing lay
edgarallanpoe,"quantity of ignited charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over"
edgarallanpoe,"the entire scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the"
edgarallanpoe,"shop of an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against"
edgarallanpoe,"the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street."
edgarallanpoe,"At sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their still more"
edgarallanpoe,"extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen did not conduct themselves"
edgarallanpoe,"with that degree of decorum which might have been expected. Legs,"
edgarallanpoe,"leaning against the wall near which he happened to be standing, dropped"
edgarallanpoe,"his lower jaw still lower than usual, and spread open his eyes to their"
edgarallanpoe,"fullest extent: while Hugh Tarpaulin, stooping down so as to bring his"
edgarallanpoe,"nose upon a level with the table, and spreading out a palm upon either"
edgarallanpoe,"knee, burst into a long, loud, and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed"
edgarallanpoe,and immoderate laughter.
edgarallanpoe,"Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively rude, the"
edgarallanpoe,tall president smiled very graciously upon the intruders--nodded to them
edgarallanpoe,"in a dignified manner with his head of sable plumes--and, arising, took"
edgarallanpoe,"each by an arm, and led him to a seat which some others of the company"
edgarallanpoe,had placed in the meantime for his accommodation. Legs to all this
edgarallanpoe,"offered not the slightest resistance, but sat down as he was directed;"
edgarallanpoe,"while the gallant Hugh, removing his coffin tressel from its station"
edgarallanpoe,"near the head of the table, to the vicinity of the little consumptive"
edgarallanpoe,"lady in the winding sheet, plumped down by her side in high glee,"
edgarallanpoe,"and pouring out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better"
edgarallanpoe,acquaintance. But at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the coffin
edgarallanpoe,"seemed exceedingly nettled; and serious consequences might have ensued,"
edgarallanpoe,"had not the president, rapping upon the table with his truncheon,"
edgarallanpoe,diverted the attention of all present to the following speech:
edgarallanpoe,“It becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion”--
edgarallanpoe,"“Avast there!” interrupted Legs, looking very serious, “avast there a"
edgarallanpoe,"bit, I say, and tell us who the devil ye all are, and what business ye"
edgarallanpoe,"have here, rigged off like the foul fiends, and swilling the snug blue"
edgarallanpoe,"ruin stowed away for the winter by my honest shipmate, Will Wimble the"
edgarallanpoe,undertaker!”
edgarallanpoe,"At this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the original company"
edgarallanpoe,"half started to their feet, and uttered the same rapid succession of"
edgarallanpoe,wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the attention of the
edgarallanpoe,"seamen. The president, however, was the first to recover his composure,"
edgarallanpoe,"and at length, turning to Legs with great dignity, recommenced:"
edgarallanpoe,“Most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the part of
edgarallanpoe,"guests so illustrious, unbidden though they be. Know then that in these"
edgarallanpoe,"dominions I am monarch, and here rule with undivided empire under the"
edgarallanpoe,title of ‘King Pest the First.’
edgarallanpoe,"“This apartment, which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the shop of"
edgarallanpoe,"Will Wimble the undertaker--a man whom we know not, and whose plebeian"
edgarallanpoe,appellation has never before this night thwarted our royal ears--this
edgarallanpoe,"apartment, I say, is the Dais-Chamber of our Palace, devoted to the"
edgarallanpoe,"councils of our kingdom, and to other sacred and lofty purposes."
edgarallanpoe,"“The noble lady who sits opposite is Queen Pest, our Serene Consort. The"
edgarallanpoe,"other exalted personages whom you behold are all of our family, and"
edgarallanpoe,wear the insignia of the blood royal under the respective titles of
edgarallanpoe,‘His Grace the Arch Duke Pest-Iferous’--‘His Grace the Duke
edgarallanpoe,Pest-Ilential’--‘His Grace the Duke Tem-Pest’--and ‘Her Serene Highness
edgarallanpoe,the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.’
edgarallanpoe,"“As regards,” continued he, “your demand of the business upon which we"
edgarallanpoe,"sit here in council, we might be pardoned for replying that it concerns,"
edgarallanpoe,"and concerns alone, our own private and regal interest, and is in no"
edgarallanpoe,manner important to any other than ourself. But in consideration of
edgarallanpoe,those rights to which as guests and strangers you may feel yourselves
edgarallanpoe,"entitled, we will furthermore explain that we are here this night,"
edgarallanpoe,"prepared by deep research and accurate investigation, to examine,"
edgarallanpoe,"analyze, and thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit--the"
edgarallanpoe,incomprehensible qualities and nature--of those inestimable treasures of
edgarallanpoe,"the palate, the wines, ales, and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis: by"
edgarallanpoe,so doing to advance not more our own designs than the true welfare of
edgarallanpoe,"that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all, whose dominions are"
edgarallanpoe,"unlimited, and whose name is ‘Death’.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Whose name is Davy Jones!” ejaculated Tarpaulin, helping the lady by"
edgarallanpoe,"his side to a skull of liqueur, and pouring out a second for himself."
edgarallanpoe,"“Profane varlet!” said the president, now turning his attention to"
edgarallanpoe,"the worthy Hugh, “profane and execrable wretch!--we have said, that in"
edgarallanpoe,"consideration of those rights which, even in thy filthy person, we feel"
edgarallanpoe,"no inclination to violate, we have condescended to make reply to thy"
edgarallanpoe,"rude and unseasonable inquiries. We nevertheless, for your unhallowed"
edgarallanpoe,"intrusion upon our councils, believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy"
edgarallanpoe,companion in each a gallon of Black Strap--having imbibed which to the
edgarallanpoe,prosperity of our kingdom--at a single draught--and upon your bended
edgarallanpoe,"knees--ye shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way, or"
edgarallanpoe,"remain and be admitted to the privileges of our table, according to your"
edgarallanpoe,respective and individual pleasures.”
edgarallanpoe,"“It would be a matter of utter impossibility,” replied Legs, whom the"
edgarallanpoe,assumptions and dignity of King Pest the First had evidently inspired
edgarallanpoe,"some feelings of respect, and who arose and steadied himself by the"
edgarallanpoe,"table as he spoke--“It would, please your majesty, be a matter of utter"
edgarallanpoe,impossibility to stow away in my hold even one-fourth part of the same
edgarallanpoe,liquor which your majesty has just mentioned. To say nothing of the
edgarallanpoe,"stuffs placed on board in the forenoon by way of ballast, and not to"
edgarallanpoe,mention the various ales and liqueurs shipped this evening at different
edgarallanpoe,"sea-ports, I have, at present, a full cargo of ‘humming stuff’ taken in"
edgarallanpoe,"and duly paid for at the sign of the ‘Jolly Tar.’ You will, therefore,"
edgarallanpoe,"please your majesty, be so good as to take the will for the deed--for by"
edgarallanpoe,no manner of means either can I or will I swallow another drop--least
edgarallanpoe,of all a drop of that villainous bilge-water that answers to the hall of
edgarallanpoe,‘Black Strap.’”
edgarallanpoe,"“Belay that!” interrupted Tarpaulin, astonished not more at the length"
edgarallanpoe,of his companion’s speech than at the nature of his refusal--“Belay that
edgarallanpoe,"you tubber!--and I say, Legs, none of your palaver! My hull is still"
edgarallanpoe,"light, although I confess you yourself seem to be a little top-heavy;"
edgarallanpoe,"and as for the matter of your share of the cargo, why rather than raise"
edgarallanpoe,"a squall I would find stowageroom for it myself, but”--"
edgarallanpoe,"“This proceeding,” interposed the president, “is by no means in"
edgarallanpoe,"accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence, which is in its"
edgarallanpoe,"nature Median, and not to be altered or recalled. The conditions we have"
edgarallanpoe,"imposed must be fulfilled to the letter, and that without a moment’s"
edgarallanpoe,hesitation--in failure of which fulfilment we decree that you do here be
edgarallanpoe,"tied neck and heels together, and duly drowned as rebels in yon hogshead"
edgarallanpoe,of October beer!”
edgarallanpoe,“A sentence!--a sentence!--a righteous and just sentence!--a glorious
edgarallanpoe,"decree!--a most worthy and upright, and holy condemnation!” shouted the"
edgarallanpoe,Pest family altogether. The king elevated his forehead into innumerable
edgarallanpoe,wrinkles; the gouty little old man puffed like a pair of bellows; the
edgarallanpoe,lady of the winding sheet waved her nose to and fro; the gentleman in
edgarallanpoe,the cotton drawers pricked up his ears; she of the shroud gasped like a
edgarallanpoe,dying fish; and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up his eyes.
edgarallanpoe,“Ugh! ugh! ugh!” chuckled Tarpaulin without heeding the general
edgarallanpoe,"excitation, “ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--I was"
edgarallanpoe,"saying,” said he, “I was saying when Mr. King Pest poked in his"
edgarallanpoe,"marlin-spike, that as for the matter of two or three gallons more or"
edgarallanpoe,"less of Black Strap, it was a trifle to a tight sea-boat like myself not"
edgarallanpoe,overstowed--but when it comes to drinking the health of the Devil (whom
edgarallanpoe,God assoilzie) and going down upon my marrow bones to his ill-favored
edgarallanpoe,"majesty there, whom I know, as well as I know myself to be a sinner, to"
edgarallanpoe,"be nobody in the whole world, but Tim Hurlygurly the stage-player--why!"
edgarallanpoe,"it’s quite another guess sort of a thing, and utterly and altogether"
edgarallanpoe,past my comprehension.”
edgarallanpoe,He was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity. At the name
edgarallanpoe,Tim Hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name seats.
edgarallanpoe,“Treason!” shouted his Majesty King Pest the First.
edgarallanpoe,“Treason!” said the little man with the gout.
edgarallanpoe,“Treason!” screamed the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.
edgarallanpoe,“Treason!” muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up.
edgarallanpoe,“Treason!” growled he of the coffin.
edgarallanpoe,"“Treason! treason!” shrieked her majesty of the mouth; and, seizing by"
edgarallanpoe,"the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate Tarpaulin, who had just"
edgarallanpoe,"commenced pouring out for himself a skull of liqueur, she lifted him"
edgarallanpoe,"high into the air, and let him fall without ceremony into the huge open"
edgarallanpoe,"puncheon of his beloved ale. Bobbing up and down, for a few seconds,"
edgarallanpoe,"like an apple in a bowl of toddy, he, at length, finally disappeared"
edgarallanpoe,"amid the whirlpool of foam which, in the already effervescent liquor,"
edgarallanpoe,his struggles easily succeeded in creating.
edgarallanpoe,"Not tamely, however, did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture of his"
edgarallanpoe,"companion. Jostling King Pest through the open trap, the valiant Legs"
edgarallanpoe,"slammed the door down upon him with an oath, and strode towards the"
edgarallanpoe,centre of the room. Here tearing down the skeleton which swung over the
edgarallanpoe,"table, he laid it about him with so much energy and good will, that, as"
edgarallanpoe,"the last glimpses of light died away within the apartment, he succeeded"
edgarallanpoe,in knocking out the brains of the little gentleman with the gout.
edgarallanpoe,Rushing then with all his force against the fatal hogshead full of
edgarallanpoe,"October ale and Hugh Tarpaulin, he rolled it over and over in an"
edgarallanpoe,instant. Out burst a deluge of liquor so fierce--so impetuous--so
edgarallanpoe,overwhelming--that the room was flooded from wall to wall--the loaded
edgarallanpoe,table was overturned--the tressels were thrown upon their backs--the tub
edgarallanpoe,of punch into the fire-place--and the ladies into hysterics. Piles of
edgarallanpoe,"death-furniture floundered about. Jugs, pitchers, and carboys mingled"
edgarallanpoe,"promiscuously in the melee, and wicker flagons encountered desperately"
edgarallanpoe,with bottles of junk. The man with the horrors was drowned upon the
edgarallanpoe,spot-the little stiff gentleman floated off in his coffin--and the
edgarallanpoe,"victorious Legs, seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud, rushed"
edgarallanpoe,"out with her into the street, and made a bee-line for the “Free and"
edgarallanpoe,"Easy,” followed under easy sail by the redoubtable Hugh Tarpaulin, who,"
edgarallanpoe,"having sneezed three or four times, panted and puffed after him with the"
edgarallanpoe,Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.
edgarallanpoe,THREE SUNDAYS IN A WEEK
edgarallanpoe,"“YOU hard-headed, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty, crusty, musty,"
edgarallanpoe,"fusty, old savage!” said I, in fancy, one afternoon, to my grand uncle"
edgarallanpoe,Rumgudgeon--shaking my fist at him in imagination.
edgarallanpoe,"Only in imagination. The fact is, some trivial discrepancy did exist,"
edgarallanpoe,"just then, between what I said and what I had not the courage to"
edgarallanpoe,say--between what I did and what I had half a mind to do.
edgarallanpoe,"The old porpoise, as I opened the drawing-room door, was sitting with"
edgarallanpoe,"his feet upon the mantel-piece, and a bumper of port in his paw, making"
edgarallanpoe,strenuous efforts to accomplish the ditty.
edgarallanpoe,Remplis ton verre vide!
edgarallanpoe,Vide ton verre plein!
edgarallanpoe,"“My dear uncle,” said I, closing the door gently, and approaching"
edgarallanpoe,"him with the blandest of smiles, “you are always so very kind and"
edgarallanpoe,"considerate, and have evinced your benevolence in so many--so very many"
edgarallanpoe,ways--that--that I feel I have only to suggest this little point to you
edgarallanpoe,once more to make sure of your full acquiescence.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Hem!” said he, “good boy! go on!”"
edgarallanpoe,"“I am sure, my dearest uncle (you confounded old rascal!), that you"
edgarallanpoe,"have no design really, seriously, to oppose my union with Kate. This is"
edgarallanpoe,"merely a joke of yours, I know--ha! ha! ha!--how very pleasant you are"
edgarallanpoe,at times.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Ha! ha! ha!” said he, “curse you! yes!”"
edgarallanpoe,"“To be sure--of course! I knew you were jesting. Now, uncle, all that"
edgarallanpoe,"Kate and myself wish at present, is that you would oblige us with your"
edgarallanpoe,"advice as--as regards the time--you know, uncle--in short, when will it"
edgarallanpoe,"be most convenient for yourself, that the wedding shall--shall come off,"
edgarallanpoe,you know?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Come off, you scoundrel!--what do you mean by that?--Better wait till"
edgarallanpoe,it goes on.”
edgarallanpoe,“Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--hi! hi! hi!--ho! ho! ho!--hu! hu! hu!--that’s
edgarallanpoe,"good!--oh that’s capital--such a wit! But all we want just now, you"
edgarallanpoe,"know, uncle, is that you would indicate the time precisely.”"
edgarallanpoe,“Ah!--precisely?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes, uncle--that is, if it would be quite agreeable to yourself.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Wouldn’t it answer, Bobby, if I were to leave it at random--some time"
edgarallanpoe,"within a year or so, for example?--must I say precisely?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“If you please, uncle--precisely.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Well, then, Bobby, my boy--you’re a fine fellow, aren’t you?--since you"
edgarallanpoe,will have the exact time I’ll--why I’ll oblige you for once:”
edgarallanpoe,“Dear uncle!”
edgarallanpoe,"“Hush, sir!” (drowning my voice)--“I’ll oblige you for once. You shall"
edgarallanpoe,"have my consent--and the plum, we mus’n’t forget the plum--let me see!"
edgarallanpoe,"when shall it be? To-day’s Sunday--isn’t it? Well, then, you shall"
edgarallanpoe,"be married precisely--precisely, now mind!--when three Sundays come"
edgarallanpoe,"together in a week! Do you hear me, sir! What are you gaping at? I say,"
edgarallanpoe,you shall have Kate and her plum when three Sundays come together in a
edgarallanpoe,"week--but not till then--you young scapegrace--not till then, if I"
edgarallanpoe,die for it. You know me--I’m a man of my word--now be off!” Here he
edgarallanpoe,"swallowed his bumper of port, while I rushed from the room in despair."
edgarallanpoe,"A very “fine old English gentleman,” was my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon, but"
edgarallanpoe,"unlike him of the song, he had his weak points. He was a little, pursy,"
edgarallanpoe,"pompous, passionate semicircular somebody, with a red nose, a thick"
edgarallanpoe,"scull, (sic) a long purse, and a strong sense of his own consequence."
edgarallanpoe,"With the best heart in the world, he contrived, through a predominant"
edgarallanpoe,"whim of contradiction, to earn for himself, among those who only knew"
edgarallanpoe,"him superficially, the character of a curmudgeon. Like many excellent"
edgarallanpoe,"people, he seemed possessed with a spirit of tantalization, which might"
edgarallanpoe,"easily, at a casual glance, have been mistaken for malevolence. To every"
edgarallanpoe,"request, a positive “No!” was his immediate answer, but in the end--in"
edgarallanpoe,"the long, long end--there were exceedingly few requests which he"
edgarallanpoe,refused. Against all attacks upon his purse he made the most sturdy
edgarallanpoe,"defence; but the amount extorted from him, at last, was generally in"
edgarallanpoe,direct ratio with the length of the siege and the stubbornness of the
edgarallanpoe,resistance. In charity no one gave more liberally or with a worse grace.
edgarallanpoe,"For the fine arts, and especially for the belles-lettres, he entertained"
edgarallanpoe,"a profound contempt. With this he had been inspired by Casimir Perier,"
edgarallanpoe,whose pert little query “A quoi un poete est il bon?” he was in the
edgarallanpoe,"habit of quoting, with a very droll pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra"
edgarallanpoe,of logical wit. Thus my own inkling for the Muses had excited his entire
edgarallanpoe,"displeasure. He assured me one day, when I asked him for a new copy of"
edgarallanpoe,"Horace, that the translation of “Poeta nascitur non fit” was “a nasty"
edgarallanpoe,poet for nothing fit”--a remark which I took in high dudgeon. His
edgarallanpoe,"repugnance to “the humanities” had, also, much increased of late, by"
edgarallanpoe,an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural science.
edgarallanpoe,"Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no less a"
edgarallanpoe,"personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer upon quack physics."
edgarallanpoe,This set him off at a tangent; and just at the epoch of this story--for
edgarallanpoe,story it is getting to be after all--my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon was
edgarallanpoe,accessible and pacific only upon points which happened to chime in with
edgarallanpoe,"the caprioles of the hobby he was riding. For the rest, he laughed with"
edgarallanpoe,"his arms and legs, and his politics were stubborn and easily understood."
edgarallanpoe,"He thought, with Horsley, that “the people have nothing to do with the"
edgarallanpoe,laws but to obey them.”
edgarallanpoe,"I had lived with the old gentleman all my life. My parents, in dying,"
edgarallanpoe,had bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy. I believe the old villain
edgarallanpoe,loved me as his own child--nearly if not quite as well as he loved
edgarallanpoe,"Kate--but it was a dog’s existence that he led me, after all. From my"
edgarallanpoe,"first year until my fifth, he obliged me with very regular floggings."
edgarallanpoe,"From five to fifteen, he threatened me, hourly, with the House of"
edgarallanpoe,"Correction. From fifteen to twenty, not a day passed in which he did not"
edgarallanpoe,"promise to cut me off with a shilling. I was a sad dog, it is true--but"
edgarallanpoe,"then it was a part of my nature--a point of my faith. In Kate, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"I had a firm friend, and I knew it. She was a good girl, and told me"
edgarallanpoe,very sweetly that I might have her (plum and all) whenever I could
edgarallanpoe,"badger my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon, into the necessary consent. Poor"
edgarallanpoe,"girl!--she was barely fifteen, and without this consent, her little"
edgarallanpoe,amount in the funds was not come-at-able until five immeasurable summers
edgarallanpoe,"had “dragged their slow length along.” What, then, to do? At fifteen, or"
edgarallanpoe,even at twenty-one (for I had now passed my fifth olympiad) five years
edgarallanpoe,in prospect are very much the same as five hundred. In vain we besieged
edgarallanpoe,the old gentleman with importunities. Here was a piece de resistance (as
edgarallanpoe,Messieurs Ude and Careme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a
edgarallanpoe,"T. It would have stiffed the indignation of Job himself, to see how much"
edgarallanpoe,like an old mouser he behaved to us two poor wretched little mice. In
edgarallanpoe,his heart he wished for nothing more ardently than our union. He had
edgarallanpoe,"made up his mind to this all along. In fact, he would have given ten"
edgarallanpoe,thousand pounds from his own pocket (Kate’s plum was her own) if he
edgarallanpoe,could have invented any thing like an excuse for complying with our
edgarallanpoe,very natural wishes. But then we had been so imprudent as to broach
edgarallanpoe,"the subject ourselves. Not to oppose it under such circumstances, I"
edgarallanpoe,"sincerely believe, was not in his power."
edgarallanpoe,I have said already that he had his weak points; but in speaking of
edgarallanpoe,"these, I must not be understood as referring to his obstinacy: which was"
edgarallanpoe,one of his strong points--“assurement ce n’ etait pas sa foible.” When
edgarallanpoe,I mention his weakness I have allusion to a bizarre old-womanish
edgarallanpoe,"superstition which beset him. He was great in dreams, portents, et id"
edgarallanpoe,"genus omne of rigmarole. He was excessively punctilious, too, upon small"
edgarallanpoe,"points of honor, and, after his own fashion, was a man of his word,"
edgarallanpoe,"beyond doubt. This was, in fact, one of his hobbies. The spirit of his"
edgarallanpoe,"vows he made no scruple of setting at naught, but the letter was a bond"
edgarallanpoe,"inviolable. Now it was this latter peculiarity in his disposition,"
edgarallanpoe,"of which Kate’s ingenuity enabled us one fine day, not long after our"
edgarallanpoe,"interview in the dining-room, to take a very unexpected advantage, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"having thus, in the fashion of all modern bards and orators, exhausted"
edgarallanpoe,"in prolegomena, all the time at my command, and nearly all the room at"
edgarallanpoe,"my disposal, I will sum up in a few words what constitutes the whole"
edgarallanpoe,pith of the story.
edgarallanpoe,It happened then--so the Fates ordered it--that among the naval
edgarallanpoe,"acquaintances of my betrothed, were two gentlemen who had just set foot"
edgarallanpoe,"upon the shores of England, after a year’s absence, each, in foreign"
edgarallanpoe,"travel. In company with these gentlemen, my cousin and I, preconcertedly"
edgarallanpoe,"paid uncle Rumgudgeon a visit on the afternoon of Sunday, October the"
edgarallanpoe,"tenth,--just three weeks after the memorable decision which had so"
edgarallanpoe,cruelly defeated our hopes. For about half an hour the conversation ran
edgarallanpoe,"upon ordinary topics, but at last, we contrived, quite naturally, to"
edgarallanpoe,give it the following turn:
edgarallanpoe,CAPT. PRATT. “Well I have been absent just one year.--Just one year
edgarallanpoe,"to-day, as I live--let me see! yes!--this is October the tenth. You"
edgarallanpoe,"remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, I called, this day year to bid you good-bye."
edgarallanpoe,"And by the way, it does seem something like a coincidence, does it"
edgarallanpoe,"not--that our friend, Captain Smitherton, here, has been absent exactly"
edgarallanpoe,a year also--a year to-day!”
edgarallanpoe,"SMITHERTON. “Yes! just one year to a fraction. You will remember, Mr."
edgarallanpoe,"Rumgudgeon, that I called with Capt. Pratol on this very day, last year,"
edgarallanpoe,to pay my parting respects.”
edgarallanpoe,"UNCLE. “Yes, yes, yes--I remember it very well--very queer indeed! Both"
edgarallanpoe,"of you gone just one year. A very strange coincidence, indeed! Just what"
edgarallanpoe,Doctor Dubble L. Dee would denominate an extraordinary concurrence of
edgarallanpoe,events. Doctor Dub-”
edgarallanpoe,"KATE. (Interrupting.) “To be sure, papa, it is something strange; but"
edgarallanpoe,then Captain Pratt and Captain Smitherton didn’t go altogether the same
edgarallanpoe,"route, and that makes a difference, you know.”"
edgarallanpoe,"UNCLE. “I don’t know any such thing, you huzzy! How should I? I think it"
edgarallanpoe,"only makes the matter more remarkable, Doctor Dubble L. Dee--”"
edgarallanpoe,"KATE. “Why, papa, Captain Pratt went round Cape Horn, and Captain"
edgarallanpoe,Smitherton doubled the Cape of Good Hope.”
edgarallanpoe,"UNCLE. “Precisely!--the one went east and the other went west, you jade,"
edgarallanpoe,"and they both have gone quite round the world. By the by, Doctor Dubble"
edgarallanpoe,L. Dee--”
edgarallanpoe,"MYSELF. (Hurriedly.) “Captain Pratt, you must come and spend the evening"
edgarallanpoe,with us to-morrow--you and Smitherton--you can tell us all about your
edgarallanpoe,"voyage, and we’ll have a game of whist and--”"
edgarallanpoe,"PRATT. “Wist, my dear fellow--you forget. To-morrow will be Sunday. Some"
edgarallanpoe,other evening--”
edgarallanpoe,"KATE. “Oh, no, fie!--Robert’s not quite so bad as that. To-day’s"
edgarallanpoe,Sunday.”
edgarallanpoe,PRATT. “I beg both your pardons--but I can’t be so much mistaken. I know
edgarallanpoe,"to-morrow’s Sunday, because-”"
edgarallanpoe,SMITHERTON. (Much surprised.) “What are you all thinking about? Wasn’t
edgarallanpoe,"yesterday, Sunday, I should like to know?”"
edgarallanpoe,ALL. “Yesterday indeed! you are out!”
edgarallanpoe,"UNCLE. “To-day’s Sunday, I say--don’t I know?”"
edgarallanpoe,PRATT. “Oh no!--to-morrow’s Sunday.”
edgarallanpoe,SMITHERTON. “You are all mad--every one of you. I am as positive that
edgarallanpoe,yesterday was Sunday as I am that I sit upon this chair.”
edgarallanpoe,"KATE. (jumping up eagerly.) “I see it--I see it all. Papa, this is a"
edgarallanpoe,"judgment upon you, about--about you know what. Let me alone, and I’ll"
edgarallanpoe,"explain it all in a minute. It’s a very simple thing, indeed. Captain"
edgarallanpoe,Smitherton says that yesterday was Sunday: so it was; he is right.
edgarallanpoe,"Cousin Bobby, and uncle and I say that to-day is Sunday: so it is; we"
edgarallanpoe,are right. Captain Pratt maintains that to-morrow will be Sunday: so it
edgarallanpoe,"will; he is right, too. The fact is, we are all right, and thus three"
edgarallanpoe,Sundays have come together in a week.”
edgarallanpoe,"SMITHERTON. (After a pause.) “By the by, Pratt, Kate has us completely."
edgarallanpoe,"What fools we two are! Mr. Rumgudgeon, the matter stands thus: the"
edgarallanpoe,"earth, you know, is twenty-four thousand miles in circumference."
edgarallanpoe,Now this globe of the earth turns upon its own axis--revolves--spins
edgarallanpoe,"round--these twenty-four thousand miles of extent, going from west"
edgarallanpoe,"to east, in precisely twenty-four hours. Do you understand Mr."
edgarallanpoe,Rumgudgeon?-”
edgarallanpoe,UNCLE. “To be sure--to be sure--Doctor Dub-”
edgarallanpoe,"SMITHERTON. (Drowning his voice.) “Well, sir; that is at the rate of one"
edgarallanpoe,"thousand miles per hour. Now, suppose that I sail from this position a"
edgarallanpoe,thousand miles east. Of course I anticipate the rising of the sun here
edgarallanpoe,at London by just one hour. I see the sun rise one hour before you
edgarallanpoe,"do. Proceeding, in the same direction, yet another thousand miles, I"
edgarallanpoe,"anticipate the rising by two hours--another thousand, and I anticipate"
edgarallanpoe,"it by three hours, and so on, until I go entirely round the globe, and"
edgarallanpoe,"back to this spot, when, having gone twenty-four thousand miles east,"
edgarallanpoe,I anticipate the rising of the London sun by no less than twenty-four
edgarallanpoe,"hours; that is to say, I am a day in advance of your time. Understand,"
edgarallanpoe,eh?”
edgarallanpoe,UNCLE. “But Double L. Dee-”
edgarallanpoe,"SMITHERTON. (Speaking very loud.) “Captain Pratt, on the contrary, when"
edgarallanpoe,"he had sailed a thousand miles west of this position, was an hour, and"
edgarallanpoe,"when he had sailed twenty-four thousand miles west, was twenty-four"
edgarallanpoe,"hours, or one day, behind the time at London. Thus, with me, yesterday"
edgarallanpoe,"was Sunday--thus, with you, to-day is Sunday--and thus, with Pratt,"
edgarallanpoe,"to-morrow will be Sunday. And what is more, Mr. Rumgudgeon, it"
edgarallanpoe,is positively clear that we are all right; for there can be no
edgarallanpoe,philosophical reason assigned why the idea of one of us should have
edgarallanpoe,preference over that of the other.”
edgarallanpoe,"UNCLE. “My eyes!--well, Kate--well, Bobby!--this is a judgment upon me,"
edgarallanpoe,"as you say. But I am a man of my word--mark that! you shall have her,"
edgarallanpoe,"boy, (plum and all), when you please. Done up, by Jove! Three Sundays"
edgarallanpoe,"all in a row! I’ll go, and take Dubble L. Dee’s opinion upon that.”"
