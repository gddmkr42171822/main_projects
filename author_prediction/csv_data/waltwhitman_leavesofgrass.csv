waltwhitman,"Who have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates,"
waltwhitman,"rulers and priests,"
waltwhitman,"I, habitan of the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is in himself"

waltwhitman,To make himself by them the law unto himself.
waltwhitman,When I Read the Book
waltwhitman,"When I read the book, the biography famous,"
waltwhitman,And is this then (said I) what the author calls a man's life?
waltwhitman,And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life?
waltwhitman,"(As if any man really knew aught of my life,"
waltwhitman,"Why even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life,"
waltwhitman,"Only a few hints, a few diffused faint clews and indirections"
waltwhitman,I seek for my own use to trace out here.)
waltwhitman,Beginning My Studies
waltwhitman,"Beginning my studies the first step pleas'd me so much,"
waltwhitman,"The mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,"
waltwhitman,"The least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,"
waltwhitman,"The first step I say awed me and pleas'd me so much,"
waltwhitman,"I have hardly gone and hardly wish'd to go any farther,"
waltwhitman,But stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.
waltwhitman,Beginners
waltwhitman,"How they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at intervals,)"
waltwhitman,"How dear and dreadful they are to the earth,"
waltwhitman,How they inure to themselves as much as to any--what a paradox
waltwhitman,"appears their age,"
waltwhitman,"How people respond to them, yet know them not,"
waltwhitman,"How there is something relentless in their fate all times,"
waltwhitman,"How all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,"
waltwhitman,And how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same
waltwhitman,great purchase.
waltwhitman,To the States
waltwhitman,"To the States or any one of them, or any city of the States, Resist"
waltwhitman,"much, obey little,"

waltwhitman,afterward resumes its liberty.
waltwhitman,On Journeys Through the States
waltwhitman,"On journeys through the States we start,"
waltwhitman,"(Ay through the world, urged by these songs,"
waltwhitman,"Sailing henceforth to every land, to every sea,)"
waltwhitman,"We willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all."
waltwhitman,"We have watch'd the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on,"
waltwhitman,"And have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as the"
waltwhitman,"seasons, and effuse as much?"
waltwhitman,"We dwell a while in every city and town,"
waltwhitman,"We pass through Kanada, the North-east, the vast valley of the"
waltwhitman,"Mississippi, and the Southern States,"
waltwhitman,"We confer on equal terms with each of the States,"
waltwhitman,"We make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear,"
waltwhitman,"We say to ourselves, Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the"
waltwhitman,"body and the soul,"
waltwhitman,"Dwell a while and pass on, be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic,"
waltwhitman,"And what you effuse may then return as the seasons return,"
waltwhitman,And may be just as much as the seasons.
waltwhitman,To a Certain Cantatrice
waltwhitman,"Here, take this gift,"
waltwhitman,"I was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or general,"
waltwhitman,"One who should serve the good old cause, the great idea, the"
waltwhitman,"progress and freedom of the race,"
waltwhitman,"Some brave confronter of despots, some daring rebel;"
waltwhitman,But I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as to any.
waltwhitman,Me Imperturbe
waltwhitman,"Me imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,"
waltwhitman,"Master of all or mistress of all, aplomb in the midst of irrational things,"
waltwhitman,"Imbued as they, passive, receptive, silent as they,"
waltwhitman,"Finding my occupation, poverty, notoriety, foibles, crimes, less"
waltwhitman,"important than I thought,"
waltwhitman,"Me toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee,"
waltwhitman,"or far north or inland,"
waltwhitman,"A river man, or a man of the woods or of any farm-life of these"
waltwhitman,"States or of the coast, or the lakes or Kanada,"
waltwhitman,"Me wherever my life is lived, O to be self-balanced for contingencies,"
waltwhitman,"To confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as"
waltwhitman,the trees and animals do.
waltwhitman,Savantism
waltwhitman,Thither as I look I see each result and glory retracing itself and
waltwhitman,"nestling close, always obligated,"
waltwhitman,"Thither hours, months, years--thither trades, compacts,"
waltwhitman,"establishments, even the most minute,"
waltwhitman,"Thither every-day life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates;"
waltwhitman,"Thither we also, I with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant,"
waltwhitman,As a father to his father going takes his children along with him.
waltwhitman,The Ship Starting
waltwhitman,"Lo, the unbounded sea,"
waltwhitman,"On its breast a ship starting, spreading all sails, carrying even"
waltwhitman,her moonsails.
waltwhitman,The pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so stately--
waltwhitman,"below emulous waves press forward,"
waltwhitman,They surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam.
waltwhitman,I Hear America Singing
waltwhitman,"I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,"
waltwhitman,"Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,"
waltwhitman,"The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,"
waltwhitman,"The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,"
waltwhitman,"The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand"
waltwhitman,"singing on the steamboat deck,"
waltwhitman,"The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as"
waltwhitman,"he stands,"
waltwhitman,"The wood-cutter's song, the ploughboy's on his way in the morning,"
waltwhitman,"or at noon intermission or at sundown,"
waltwhitman,"The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work,"
waltwhitman,"or of the girl sewing or washing,"
waltwhitman,"Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,"
waltwhitman,The day what belongs to the day--at night the party of young
waltwhitman,"fellows, robust, friendly,"
waltwhitman,Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.
waltwhitman,What Place Is Besieged?
waltwhitman,"What place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?"
waltwhitman,"Lo, I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal,"
waltwhitman,"And with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery,"
waltwhitman,"And artillery-men, the deadliest that ever fired gun."
waltwhitman,Still Though the One I Sing
waltwhitman,"Still though the one I sing,"
waltwhitman,"(One, yet of contradictions made,) I dedicate to Nationality,"
waltwhitman,"I leave in him revolt, (O latent right of insurrection! O"
waltwhitman,"quenchless, indispensable fire!)"
waltwhitman,Shut Not Your Doors
waltwhitman,"Shut not your doors to me proud libraries,"
waltwhitman,"For that which was lacking on all your well-fill'd shelves, yet"
waltwhitman,"needed most, I bring,"
waltwhitman,"Forth from the war emerging, a book I have made,"
waltwhitman,"The words of my book nothing, the drift of it every thing,"
waltwhitman,"A book separate, not link'd with the rest nor felt by the intellect,"
waltwhitman,But you ye untold latencies will thrill to every page.
waltwhitman,Poets to Come
waltwhitman,"Poets to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!"
waltwhitman,"Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for,"
waltwhitman,"But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than"
waltwhitman,"before known,"
waltwhitman,Arouse! for you must justify me.
waltwhitman,"I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future,"
waltwhitman,I but advance a moment only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.
waltwhitman,"I am a man who, sauntering along without fully stopping, turns a"
waltwhitman,"casual look upon you and then averts his face,"
waltwhitman,"Leaving it to you to prove and define it,"
waltwhitman,Expecting the main things from you.
waltwhitman,To You
waltwhitman,"Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why"
waltwhitman,should you not speak to me?
waltwhitman,And why should I not speak to you?
waltwhitman,Thou Reader
waltwhitman,"Thou reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I,"
waltwhitman,Therefore for thee the following chants.
waltwhitman,BOOK II
waltwhitman,Starting from Paumanok
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Starting from fish-shape Paumanok where I was born,"
waltwhitman,"Well-begotten, and rais'd by a perfect mother,"
waltwhitman,"After roaming many lands, lover of populous pavements,"
waltwhitman,"Dweller in Mannahatta my city, or on southern savannas,"
waltwhitman,"Or a soldier camp'd or carrying my knapsack and gun, or a miner"
waltwhitman,"in California,"
waltwhitman,"Or rude in my home in Dakota's woods, my diet meat, my drink from"
waltwhitman,"the spring,"
waltwhitman,"Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,"
waltwhitman,"Far from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and happy,"
waltwhitman,"Aware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri, aware of"
waltwhitman,"mighty Niagara,"
waltwhitman,"Aware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains, the hirsute and"
waltwhitman,"strong-breasted bull,"
waltwhitman,"Of earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers experienced, stars, rain, snow,"
waltwhitman,"my amaze,"
waltwhitman,Having studied the mocking-bird's tones and the flight of the
waltwhitman,"mountain-hawk,"
waltwhitman,"And heard at dawn the unrivall'd one, the hermit thrush from the"
waltwhitman,"swamp-cedars,"
waltwhitman,"Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World."
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Victory, union, faith, identity, time,"
waltwhitman,"The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,"
waltwhitman,"Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports."
waltwhitman,"This then is life,"
waltwhitman,Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions.
waltwhitman,How curious! how real!
waltwhitman,"Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun."
waltwhitman,"See revolving the globe,"
waltwhitman,"The ancestor-continents away group'd together,"
waltwhitman,"The present and future continents north and south, with the isthmus"
waltwhitman,between.
waltwhitman,"See, vast trackless spaces,"
waltwhitman,"As in a dream they change, they swiftly fill,"
waltwhitman,"Countless masses debouch upon them,"
waltwhitman,"They are now cover'd with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known."
waltwhitman,"See, projected through time,"
waltwhitman,For me an audience interminable.
waltwhitman,"With firm and regular step they wend, they never stop,"
waltwhitman,"Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions,"
waltwhitman,"One generation playing its part and passing on,"
waltwhitman,"Another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn,"
waltwhitman,"With faces turn'd sideways or backward towards me to listen,"
waltwhitman,With eyes retrospective towards me.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian!
waltwhitman,Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!
waltwhitman,For you a programme of chants.
waltwhitman,"Chants of the prairies,"
waltwhitman,"Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the Mexican sea,"
waltwhitman,"Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota,"
waltwhitman,"Chants going forth from the centre from Kansas, and thence equidistant,"
waltwhitman,Shooting in pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"Take my leaves America, take them South and take them North,"
waltwhitman,"Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own off-spring,"
waltwhitman,"Surround them East and West, for they would surround you,"
waltwhitman,"And you precedents, connect lovingly with them, for they connect"
waltwhitman,lovingly with you.
waltwhitman,"I conn'd old times,"
waltwhitman,"I sat studying at the feet of the great masters,"
waltwhitman,Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.
waltwhitman,In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique?
waltwhitman,Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"Dead poets, philosophs, priests,"
waltwhitman,"Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,"
waltwhitman,"Language-shapers on other shores,"
waltwhitman,"Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,"
waltwhitman,I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left
waltwhitman,"wafted hither,"
waltwhitman,"I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it,)"
waltwhitman,"Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more"
waltwhitman,"than it deserves,"
waltwhitman,"Regarding it all intently a long while, then dismissing it,"
waltwhitman,I stand in my place with my own day here.
waltwhitman,"Here lands female and male,"
waltwhitman,"Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world, here the flame of"
waltwhitman,"materials,"
waltwhitman,"Here spirituality the translatress, the openly-avow'd,"
waltwhitman,"The ever-tending, the finale of visible forms,"
waltwhitman,"The satisfier, after due long-waiting now advancing,"
waltwhitman,Yes here comes my mistress the soul.
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,"The soul,"
waltwhitman,Forever and forever--longer than soil is brown and solid--longer
waltwhitman,than water ebbs and flows.
waltwhitman,"I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the"
waltwhitman,"most spiritual poems,"
waltwhitman,"And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,"
waltwhitman,For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and
waltwhitman,of immortality.
waltwhitman,I will make a song for these States that no one State may under any
waltwhitman,"circumstances be subjected to another State,"
waltwhitman,And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by
waltwhitman,"night between all the States, and between any two of them,"
waltwhitman,"And I will make a song for the ears of the President, full of"
waltwhitman,"weapons with menacing points,"
waltwhitman,And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces;
waltwhitman,"And a song make I of the One form'd out of all,"
waltwhitman,"The fang'd and glittering One whose head is over all,"
waltwhitman,"Resolute warlike One including and over all,"
waltwhitman,(However high the head of any else that head is over all.)
waltwhitman,"I will acknowledge contemporary lands,"
waltwhitman,I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute courteously
waltwhitman,"every city large and small,"
waltwhitman,And employments! I will put in my poems that with you is heroism
waltwhitman,"upon land and sea,"
waltwhitman,And I will report all heroism from an American point of view.
waltwhitman,"I will sing the song of companionship,"
waltwhitman,"I will show what alone must finally compact these,"
waltwhitman,"I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love,"
waltwhitman,"indicating it in me,"
waltwhitman,I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were
waltwhitman,"threatening to consume me,"
waltwhitman,"I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires,"
waltwhitman,"I will give them complete abandonment,"
waltwhitman,"I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love,"
waltwhitman,For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and joy?
waltwhitman,And who but I should be the poet of comrades?
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,"I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races,"
waltwhitman,"I advance from the people in their own spirit,"
waltwhitman,Here is what sings unrestricted faith.
waltwhitman,"Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may,"
waltwhitman,"I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also,"
waltwhitman,"I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is--and I say"
waltwhitman,"there is in fact no evil,"
waltwhitman,"(Or if there is I say it is just as important to you, to the land or"
waltwhitman,"to me, as any thing else.)"
waltwhitman,"I too, following many and follow'd by many, inaugurate a religion, I"
waltwhitman,"descend into the arena,"
waltwhitman,"(It may be I am destin'd to utter the loudest cries there, the"
waltwhitman,"winner's pealing shouts,"
waltwhitman,"Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above every thing.)"
waltwhitman,"Each is not for its own sake,"
waltwhitman,I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion's sake.
waltwhitman,"I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,"
waltwhitman,"None has ever yet adored or worship'd half enough,"
waltwhitman,"None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain"
waltwhitman,the future is.
waltwhitman,I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be
waltwhitman,"their religion,"
waltwhitman,Otherwise there is just no real and permanent grandeur;
waltwhitman,"(Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion,"
waltwhitman,Nor land nor man or woman without religion.)
waltwhitman,8
waltwhitman,What are you doing young man?
waltwhitman,"Are you so earnest, so given up to literature, science, art, amours?"
waltwhitman,"These ostensible realities, politics, points?"
waltwhitman,Your ambition or business whatever it may be?
waltwhitman,"It is well--against such I say not a word, I am their poet also,"
waltwhitman,"But behold! such swiftly subside, burnt up for religion's sake,"
waltwhitman,"For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential"
waltwhitman,"life of the earth,"
waltwhitman,Any more than such are to religion.
waltwhitman,9
waltwhitman,What do you seek so pensive and silent?
waltwhitman,What do you need camerado?
waltwhitman,Dear son do you think it is love?
waltwhitman,"Listen dear son--listen America, daughter or son,"
waltwhitman,"It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess, and yet it"
waltwhitman,"satisfies, it is great,"
waltwhitman,"But there is something else very great, it makes the whole coincide,"
waltwhitman,"It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands sweeps and"
waltwhitman,provides for all.
waltwhitman,10
waltwhitman,"Know you, solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion,"
waltwhitman,The following chants each for its kind I sing.
waltwhitman,My comrade!
waltwhitman,"For you to share with me two greatnesses, and a third one rising"
waltwhitman,"inclusive and more resplendent,"
waltwhitman,"The greatness of Love and Democracy, and the greatness of Religion."
waltwhitman,"Melange mine own, the unseen and the seen,"
waltwhitman,"Mysterious ocean where the streams empty,"
waltwhitman,"Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me,"
waltwhitman,"Living beings, identities now doubtless near us in the air that we"
waltwhitman,"know not of,"
waltwhitman,"Contact daily and hourly that will not release me,"
waltwhitman,"These selecting, these in hints demanded of me."
waltwhitman,"Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me,"
waltwhitman,"Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him,"
waltwhitman,"Any more than I am held to the heavens and all the spiritual world,"
waltwhitman,"After what they have done to me, suggesting themes."
waltwhitman,O such themes--equalities! O divine average!
waltwhitman,"Warblings under the sun, usher'd as now, or at noon, or setting,"
waltwhitman,"Strains musical flowing through ages, now reaching hither,"
waltwhitman,"I take to your reckless and composite chords, add to them, and"
waltwhitman,cheerfully pass them forward.
waltwhitman,11
waltwhitman,"As I have walk'd in Alabama my morning walk,"
waltwhitman,I have seen where the she-bird the mocking-bird sat on her nest in
waltwhitman,the briers hatching her brood.
waltwhitman,"I have seen the he-bird also,"
waltwhitman,I have paus'd to hear him near at hand inflating his throat and
waltwhitman,joyfully singing.
waltwhitman,And while I paus'd it came to me that what he really sang for was
waltwhitman,"not there only,"
waltwhitman,"Nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes,"
waltwhitman,"But subtle, clandestine, away beyond,"
waltwhitman,A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born.
waltwhitman,12
waltwhitman,Democracy! near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and
waltwhitman,joyfully singing.
waltwhitman,"Ma femme! for the brood beyond us and of us,"
waltwhitman,"For those who belong here and those to come,"
waltwhitman,I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger
waltwhitman,and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.
waltwhitman,"I will make the songs of passion to give them their way,"
waltwhitman,"And your songs outlaw'd offenders, for I scan you with kindred eyes,"
waltwhitman,and carry you with me the same as any.
waltwhitman,"I will make the true poem of riches,"
waltwhitman,To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward
waltwhitman,and is not dropt by death;
waltwhitman,"I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all, and I will be the"
waltwhitman,"bard of personality,"
waltwhitman,And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of
waltwhitman,"the other,"
waltwhitman,"And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me, for I am determin'd"
waltwhitman,"to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove you illustrious,"
waltwhitman,"And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present, and"
waltwhitman,"can be none in the future,"
waltwhitman,And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be turn'd to
waltwhitman,"beautiful results,"
waltwhitman,"And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death,"
waltwhitman,And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are
waltwhitman,"compact,"
waltwhitman,"And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each"
waltwhitman,as profound as any.
waltwhitman,"I will not make poems with reference to parts,"
waltwhitman,"But I will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to ensemble,"
waltwhitman,"And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to"
waltwhitman,"all days,"
waltwhitman,And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but has
waltwhitman,"reference to the soul,"
waltwhitman,"Because having look'd at the objects of the universe, I find there"
waltwhitman,is no one nor any particle of one but has reference to the soul.
waltwhitman,13
waltwhitman,Was somebody asking to see the soul?
waltwhitman,"See, your own shape and countenance, persons, substances, beasts,"
waltwhitman,"the trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands."
waltwhitman,All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them;
waltwhitman,How can the real body ever die and be buried?
waltwhitman,"Of your real body and any man's or woman's real body,"
waltwhitman,Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners and
waltwhitman,"pass to fitting spheres,"
waltwhitman,Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the
waltwhitman,moment of death.
waltwhitman,"Not the types set up by the printer return their impression, the"
waltwhitman,"meaning, the main concern,"
waltwhitman,Any more than a man's substance and life or a woman's substance and
waltwhitman,"life return in the body and the soul,"
waltwhitman,Indifferently before death and after death.
waltwhitman,"Behold, the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern and"
waltwhitman,includes and is the soul;
waltwhitman,"Whoever you are, how superb and how divine is your body, or any part"
waltwhitman,of it!
waltwhitman,14
waltwhitman,"Whoever you are, to you endless announcements!"
waltwhitman,Daughter of the lands did you wait for your poet?
waltwhitman,Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand?
waltwhitman,"Toward the male of the States, and toward the female of the States,"
waltwhitman,"Exulting words, words to Democracy's lands."
waltwhitman,"Interlink'd, food-yielding lands!"
waltwhitman,"Land of coal and iron! land of gold! land of cotton, sugar, rice!"
waltwhitman,"Land of wheat, beef, pork! land of wool and hemp! land of the apple"
waltwhitman,and the grape!
waltwhitman,"Land of the pastoral plains, the grass-fields of the world! land of"
waltwhitman,those sweet-air'd interminable plateaus!
waltwhitman,"Land of the herd, the garden, the healthy house of adobie!"
waltwhitman,"Lands where the north-west Columbia winds, and where the south-west"
waltwhitman,Colorado winds!
waltwhitman,Land of the eastern Chesapeake! land of the Delaware!
waltwhitman,"Land of Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan!"
waltwhitman,Land of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! land of Vermont and
waltwhitman,Connecticut!
waltwhitman,Land of the ocean shores! land of sierras and peaks!
waltwhitman,Land of boatmen and sailors! fishermen's land!
waltwhitman,Inextricable lands! the clutch'd together! the passionate ones!
waltwhitman,The side by side! the elder and younger brothers! the bony-limb'd!
waltwhitman,The great women's land! the feminine! the experienced sisters and
waltwhitman,the inexperienced sisters!
waltwhitman,Far breath'd land! Arctic braced! Mexican breez'd! the diverse! the
waltwhitman,compact!
waltwhitman,The Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Carolinian!
waltwhitman,O all and each well-loved by me! my intrepid nations! O I at any
waltwhitman,rate include you all with perfect love!
waltwhitman,I cannot be discharged from you! not from one any sooner than another!
waltwhitman,"O death! O for all that, I am yet of you unseen this hour with"
waltwhitman,"irrepressible love,"
waltwhitman,"Walking New England, a friend, a traveler,"
waltwhitman,Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples on
waltwhitman,"Paumanok's sands,"
waltwhitman,"Crossing the prairies, dwelling again in Chicago, dwelling in every town,"
waltwhitman,"Observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,"
waltwhitman,"Listening to orators and oratresses in public halls,"
waltwhitman,"Of and through the States as during life, each man and woman my neighbor,"
waltwhitman,"The Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to me, and I as near to him and her,"
waltwhitman,"The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me, and I yet with any of them,"
waltwhitman,"Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river, yet in my house of adobie,"
waltwhitman,"Yet returning eastward, yet in the Seaside State or in Maryland,"
waltwhitman,"Yet Kanadian cheerily braving the winter, the snow and ice welcome to me,"
waltwhitman,"Yet a true son either of Maine or of the Granite State, or the"
waltwhitman,"Narragansett Bay State, or the Empire State,"
waltwhitman,"Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same, yet welcoming every"
waltwhitman,"new brother,"
waltwhitman,Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones from the hour they
waltwhitman,"unite with the old ones,"
waltwhitman,"Coming among the new ones myself to be their companion and equal,"
waltwhitman,"coming personally to you now,"
waltwhitman,"Enjoining you to acts, characters, spectacles, with me."
waltwhitman,15
waltwhitman,"With me with firm holding, yet haste, haste on."
waltwhitman,"For your life adhere to me,"
waltwhitman,(I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give
waltwhitman,"myself really to you, but what of that?"
waltwhitman,Must not Nature be persuaded many times?)
waltwhitman,"No dainty dolce affettuoso I,"
waltwhitman,"Bearded, sun-burnt, gray-neck'd, forbidding, I have arrived,"
waltwhitman,"To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe,"
waltwhitman,For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.
waltwhitman,16
waltwhitman,"On my way a moment I pause,"
waltwhitman,Here for you! and here for America!
waltwhitman,"Still the present I raise aloft, still the future of the States I"
waltwhitman,"harbinge glad and sublime,"
waltwhitman,And for the past I pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines.
waltwhitman,"The red aborigines,"
waltwhitman,"Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, calls as of birds"
waltwhitman,"and animals in the woods, syllabled to us for names,"
waltwhitman,"Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez, Chattahoochee,"
waltwhitman,"Kaqueta, Oronoco,"
waltwhitman,"Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, Walla-Walla,"
waltwhitman,"Leaving such to the States they melt, they depart, charging the"
waltwhitman,water and the land with names.
waltwhitman,17
waltwhitman,"Expanding and swift, henceforth,"
waltwhitman,"Elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick and audacious,"
waltwhitman,"A world primal again, vistas of glory incessant and branching,"
waltwhitman,"A new race dominating previous ones and grander far, with new contests,"
waltwhitman,"New politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts."
waltwhitman,"These, my voice announcing--I will sleep no more but arise,"
waltwhitman,"You oceans that have been calm within me! how I feel you,"
waltwhitman,"fathomless, stirring, preparing unprecedented waves and storms."
waltwhitman,18
waltwhitman,"See, steamers steaming through my poems,"
waltwhitman,"See, in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing,"
waltwhitman,"See, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter's hut, the flat-boat,"
waltwhitman,"the maize-leaf, the claim, the rude fence, and the backwoods village,"
waltwhitman,"See, on the one side the Western Sea and on the other the Eastern Sea,"
waltwhitman,"how they advance and retreat upon my poems as upon their own shores,"
waltwhitman,"See, pastures and forests in my poems--see, animals wild and tame--see,"
waltwhitman,"beyond the Kaw, countless herds of buffalo feeding on short curly grass,"
waltwhitman,"See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets,"
waltwhitman,"with iron and stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and commerce,"
waltwhitman,"See, the many-cylinder'd steam printing-press--see, the electric"
waltwhitman,"telegraph stretching across the continent,"
waltwhitman,"See, through Atlantica's depths pulses American Europe reaching,"
waltwhitman,"pulses of Europe duly return'd,"
waltwhitman,"See, the strong and quick locomotive as it departs, panting, blowing"
waltwhitman,"the steam-whistle,"
waltwhitman,"See, ploughmen ploughing farms--see, miners digging mines--see,"
waltwhitman,"the numberless factories,"
waltwhitman,"See, mechanics busy at their benches with tools--see from among them"
waltwhitman,"superior judges, philosophs, Presidents, emerge, drest in"
waltwhitman,"working dresses,"
waltwhitman,"See, lounging through the shops and fields of the States, me"
waltwhitman,"well-belov'd, close-held by day and night,"
waltwhitman,Hear the loud echoes of my songs there--read the hints come at last.
waltwhitman,19
waltwhitman,"O camerado close! O you and me at last, and us two only."
waltwhitman,O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly!
waltwhitman,O something ecstatic and undemonstrable! O music wild!
waltwhitman,O now I triumph--and you shall also;
waltwhitman,O hand in hand--O wholesome pleasure--O one more desirer and lover!
waltwhitman,"O to haste firm holding--to haste, haste on with me."
waltwhitman,BOOK III
waltwhitman,Song of Myself
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"I celebrate myself, and sing myself,"
waltwhitman,"And what I assume you shall assume,"
waltwhitman,For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.
waltwhitman,"I loafe and invite my soul,"
waltwhitman,I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.
waltwhitman,"My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this air,"
waltwhitman,"Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their"
waltwhitman,"parents the same,"
waltwhitman,"I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,"
waltwhitman,Hoping to cease not till death.
waltwhitman,"Creeds and schools in abeyance,"
waltwhitman,"Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,"
waltwhitman,"I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,"
waltwhitman,Nature without check with original energy.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with"
waltwhitman,"perfumes,"
waltwhitman,"I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,"
waltwhitman,"The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it."
waltwhitman,"The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the"
waltwhitman,"distillation, it is odorless,"
waltwhitman,"It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,"
waltwhitman,"I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,"
waltwhitman,I am mad for it to be in contact with me.
waltwhitman,"The smoke of my own breath,"
waltwhitman,"Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,"
waltwhitman,"My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing"
waltwhitman,"of blood and air through my lungs,"
waltwhitman,"The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and"
waltwhitman,"dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,"
waltwhitman,The sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the eddies of
waltwhitman,"the wind,"
waltwhitman,"A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,"
waltwhitman,"The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,"
waltwhitman,"The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields"
waltwhitman,"and hill-sides,"
waltwhitman,"The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising"
waltwhitman,from bed and meeting the sun.
waltwhitman,Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd the earth much?
waltwhitman,Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?
waltwhitman,Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?
waltwhitman,Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of
waltwhitman,"all poems,"
waltwhitman,"You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions"
waltwhitman,"of suns left,)"
waltwhitman,"You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through"
waltwhitman,"the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,"
waltwhitman,"You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,"
waltwhitman,You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the"
waltwhitman,"beginning and the end,"
waltwhitman,But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.
waltwhitman,"There was never any more inception than there is now,"
waltwhitman,"Nor any more youth or age than there is now,"
waltwhitman,"And will never be any more perfection than there is now,"
waltwhitman,Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.
waltwhitman,"Urge and urge and urge,"
waltwhitman,Always the procreant urge of the world.
waltwhitman,"Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and"
waltwhitman,"increase, always sex,"
waltwhitman,"Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life."
waltwhitman,"To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is so."
waltwhitman,"Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well"
waltwhitman,"entretied, braced in the beams,"
waltwhitman,"Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,"
waltwhitman,I and this mystery here we stand.
waltwhitman,"Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul."
waltwhitman,"Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,"
waltwhitman,Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.
waltwhitman,"Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,"
waltwhitman,"Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they"
waltwhitman,"discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself."
waltwhitman,"Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,"
waltwhitman,"Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be"
waltwhitman,less familiar than the rest.
waltwhitman,"I am satisfied--I see, dance, laugh, sing;"
waltwhitman,"As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night,"
waltwhitman,"and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,"
waltwhitman,Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the house with
waltwhitman,"their plenty,"
waltwhitman,"Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,"
waltwhitman,"That they turn from gazing after and down the road,"
waltwhitman,"And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,"
waltwhitman,"Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?"
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"Trippers and askers surround me,"
waltwhitman,"People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and"
waltwhitman,"city I live in, or the nation,"
waltwhitman,"The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,"
waltwhitman,"My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,"
waltwhitman,"The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,"
waltwhitman,"The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss"
waltwhitman,"or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,"
waltwhitman,"Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news,"
waltwhitman,the fitful events;
waltwhitman,"These come to me days and nights and go from me again,"
waltwhitman,But they are not the Me myself.
waltwhitman,"Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,"
waltwhitman,"Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,"
waltwhitman,"Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,"
waltwhitman,"Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,"
waltwhitman,Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.
waltwhitman,Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with
waltwhitman,"linguists and contenders,"
waltwhitman,"I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait."
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,"
waltwhitman,And you must not be abased to the other.
waltwhitman,"Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,"
waltwhitman,"Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not"
waltwhitman,"even the best,"
waltwhitman,"Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice."
waltwhitman,"I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,"
waltwhitman,"How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,"
waltwhitman,"And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue"
waltwhitman,"to my bare-stript heart,"
waltwhitman,"And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet."
waltwhitman,Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass
waltwhitman,"all the argument of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,"
waltwhitman,"And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,"
waltwhitman,"And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women"
waltwhitman,"my sisters and lovers,"
waltwhitman,"And that a kelson of the creation is love,"
waltwhitman,"And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,"
waltwhitman,"And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,"
waltwhitman,"And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder, mullein and"
waltwhitman,poke-weed.
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;
waltwhitman,How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.
waltwhitman,"I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green"
waltwhitman,stuff woven.
waltwhitman,"Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,"
waltwhitman,"A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,"
waltwhitman,"Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may see"
waltwhitman,"and remark, and say Whose?"
waltwhitman,"Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation."
waltwhitman,"Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,"
waltwhitman,"And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,"
waltwhitman,"Growing among black folks as among white,"
waltwhitman,"Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I"
waltwhitman,receive them the same.
waltwhitman,And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.
waltwhitman,"Tenderly will I use you curling grass,"
waltwhitman,"It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,"
waltwhitman,"It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,"
waltwhitman,"It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out"
waltwhitman,"of their mothers' laps,"
waltwhitman,And here you are the mothers' laps.
waltwhitman,"This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,"
waltwhitman,"Darker than the colorless beards of old men,"
waltwhitman,Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.
waltwhitman,"O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,"
waltwhitman,And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.
waltwhitman,"I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,"
waltwhitman,"And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken"
waltwhitman,soon out of their laps.
waltwhitman,What do you think has become of the young and old men?
waltwhitman,And what do you think has become of the women and children?
waltwhitman,"They are alive and well somewhere,"
waltwhitman,"The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,"
waltwhitman,"And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the"
waltwhitman,"end to arrest it,"
waltwhitman,And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.
waltwhitman,"All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,"
waltwhitman,"And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier."
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?
waltwhitman,"I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it."
waltwhitman,"I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd babe, and"
waltwhitman,"am not contain'd between my hat and boots,"
waltwhitman,"And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,"
waltwhitman,"The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good."
waltwhitman,"I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,"
waltwhitman,"I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and"
waltwhitman,"fathomless as myself,"
waltwhitman,"(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)"
waltwhitman,"Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,"
waltwhitman,"For me those that have been boys and that love women,"
waltwhitman,"For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,"
waltwhitman,"For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the"
waltwhitman,"mothers of mothers,"
waltwhitman,"For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,"
waltwhitman,For me children and the begetters of children.
waltwhitman,"Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,"
waltwhitman,"I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,"
waltwhitman,"And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away."
waltwhitman,8
waltwhitman,"The little one sleeps in its cradle,"
waltwhitman,"I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies"
waltwhitman,with my hand.
waltwhitman,"The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,"
waltwhitman,I peeringly view them from the top.
waltwhitman,"The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,"
waltwhitman,"I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol"
waltwhitman,has fallen.
waltwhitman,"The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of"
waltwhitman,"the promenaders,"
waltwhitman,"The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the"

waltwhitman,"This is the geologist, this works with the scalper, and this is a"
waltwhitman,mathematician.
waltwhitman,"Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!"
waltwhitman,"Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,"
waltwhitman,I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.
waltwhitman,"Less the reminders of properties told my words,"
waltwhitman,"And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,"
waltwhitman,"And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and"
waltwhitman,"women fully equipt,"
waltwhitman,"And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that"
waltwhitman,plot and conspire.
waltwhitman,24
waltwhitman,"Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,"
waltwhitman,"Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,"
waltwhitman,"No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,"
waltwhitman,No more modest than immodest.
waltwhitman,Unscrew the locks from the doors!
waltwhitman,Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!
waltwhitman,"Whoever degrades another degrades me,"
waltwhitman,And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.
waltwhitman,"Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current"
waltwhitman,and index.
waltwhitman,"I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,"
waltwhitman,By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their
waltwhitman,counterpart of on the same terms.
waltwhitman,"Through me many long dumb voices,"
waltwhitman,"Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,"
waltwhitman,"Voices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,"
waltwhitman,"Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,"
waltwhitman,"And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the"
waltwhitman,"father-stuff,"
waltwhitman,"And of the rights of them the others are down upon,"
waltwhitman,"Of the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,"
waltwhitman,"Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung."
waltwhitman,"Through me forbidden voices,"
waltwhitman,"Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,"
waltwhitman,Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.
waltwhitman,"I do not press my fingers across my mouth,"
waltwhitman,"I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,"
waltwhitman,Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.
waltwhitman,"I believe in the flesh and the appetites,"
waltwhitman,"Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me"
waltwhitman,is a miracle.
waltwhitman,"Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am"
waltwhitman,"touch'd from,"
waltwhitman,"The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,"
waltwhitman,"This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds."
waltwhitman,If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of
waltwhitman,"my own body, or any part of it,"
waltwhitman,Translucent mould of me it shall be you!
waltwhitman,Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!
waltwhitman,Firm masculine colter it shall be you!
waltwhitman,Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!
waltwhitman,You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!
waltwhitman,Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!
waltwhitman,My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!
waltwhitman,Root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded
waltwhitman,duplicate eggs! it shall be you!
waltwhitman,"Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!"
waltwhitman,"Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!"
waltwhitman,Sun so generous it shall be you!
waltwhitman,Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!
waltwhitman,You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!
waltwhitman,Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!
waltwhitman,"Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my"
waltwhitman,"winding paths, it shall be you!"
waltwhitman,"Hands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever touch'd,"
waltwhitman,it shall be you.
waltwhitman,"I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,"
waltwhitman,"Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,"
waltwhitman,"I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the"
waltwhitman,friendship I take again.
waltwhitman,"That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,"
waltwhitman,A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics
waltwhitman,of books.
waltwhitman,To behold the day-break!
waltwhitman,"The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,"
waltwhitman,The air tastes good to my palate.
waltwhitman,Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising
waltwhitman,"freshly exuding,"
waltwhitman,Scooting obliquely high and low.
waltwhitman,"Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,"
waltwhitman,Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.
waltwhitman,"The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,"
waltwhitman,"The heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,"
waltwhitman,"The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!"
waltwhitman,25
waltwhitman,"Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,"
waltwhitman,If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.
waltwhitman,"We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,"
waltwhitman,We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.
waltwhitman,"My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,"
waltwhitman,With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.
waltwhitman,"Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,"
waltwhitman,"It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,"
waltwhitman,"Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?"
waltwhitman,"Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of"
waltwhitman,"articulation,"
waltwhitman,Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?
waltwhitman,"Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,"
waltwhitman,"The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,"
waltwhitman,"I underlying causes to balance them at last,"
waltwhitman,"My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,"
waltwhitman,"Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search"
waltwhitman,of this day.)
waltwhitman,"My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,"
waltwhitman,"Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,"
waltwhitman,I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.
waltwhitman,"Writing and talk do not prove me,"
waltwhitman,"I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,"
waltwhitman,With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.
waltwhitman,26
waltwhitman,"Now I will do nothing but listen,"
waltwhitman,"To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it."
waltwhitman,"I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames,"
waltwhitman,"clack of sticks cooking my meals,"
waltwhitman,"I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,"
waltwhitman,"I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,"
waltwhitman,"Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,"
waltwhitman,"Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of"
waltwhitman,"work-people at their meals,"
waltwhitman,"The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,"
waltwhitman,"The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing"
waltwhitman,"a death-sentence,"
waltwhitman,"The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the"
waltwhitman,"refrain of the anchor-lifters,"
waltwhitman,"The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking"
waltwhitman,"engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color'd lights,"
waltwhitman,"The steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,"
waltwhitman,"The slow march play'd at the head of the association marching two and two,"
waltwhitman,"(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)"
waltwhitman,"I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)"
waltwhitman,"I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,"
waltwhitman,It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.
waltwhitman,"I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,"
waltwhitman,Ah this indeed is music--this suits me.
waltwhitman,"A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,"
waltwhitman,The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.
waltwhitman,I hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)
waltwhitman,"The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,"
waltwhitman,"It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd them,"
waltwhitman,"It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent waves,"
waltwhitman,"I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,"
waltwhitman,"Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,"
waltwhitman,"At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,"
waltwhitman,And that we call Being.
waltwhitman,27
waltwhitman,"To be in any form, what is that?"
waltwhitman,"(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)"
waltwhitman,If nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.
waltwhitman,"Mine is no callous shell,"
waltwhitman,"I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,"
waltwhitman,They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.
waltwhitman,"I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,"
waltwhitman,To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I can stand.
waltwhitman,28
waltwhitman,"Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,"
waltwhitman,"Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,"
waltwhitman,"Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,"
waltwhitman,My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly
waltwhitman,"different from myself,"
waltwhitman,"On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,"
waltwhitman,"Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,"
waltwhitman,"Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,"
waltwhitman,"Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,"
waltwhitman,"Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,"
waltwhitman,"Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,"
waltwhitman,"Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,"
waltwhitman,"They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,"
waltwhitman,"No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,"
waltwhitman,"Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,"
waltwhitman,Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.
waltwhitman,"The sentries desert every other part of me,"
waltwhitman,"They have left me helpless to a red marauder,"
waltwhitman,They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.
waltwhitman,"I am given up by traitors,"
waltwhitman,"I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the"
waltwhitman,"greatest traitor,"
waltwhitman,"I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there."
waltwhitman,"You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,"
waltwhitman,"Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me."
waltwhitman,29
waltwhitman,"Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd touch!"
waltwhitman,"Did it make you ache so, leaving me?"
waltwhitman,"Parting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,"
waltwhitman,"Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward."
waltwhitman,"Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,"
waltwhitman,"Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden."
waltwhitman,30
waltwhitman,"All truths wait in all things,"
waltwhitman,"They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,"
waltwhitman,"They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,"
waltwhitman,"The insignificant is as big to me as any,"
waltwhitman,(What is less or more than a touch?)
waltwhitman,"Logic and sermons never convince,"
waltwhitman,The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.
waltwhitman,"(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,"
waltwhitman,Only what nobody denies is so.)
waltwhitman,"A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,"
waltwhitman,"I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,"
waltwhitman,"And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,"
waltwhitman,"And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,"
waltwhitman,And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it
waltwhitman,"becomes omnific,"
waltwhitman,"And until one and all shall delight us, and we them."
waltwhitman,31
waltwhitman,"I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars,"
waltwhitman,"And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg"
waltwhitman,"of the wren,"
waltwhitman,"And the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,"
waltwhitman,"And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,"
waltwhitman,"And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,"
waltwhitman,"And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue,"
waltwhitman,And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.
waltwhitman,"I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,"
waltwhitman,"grains, esculent roots,"
waltwhitman,"And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,"
waltwhitman,"And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,"
waltwhitman,But call any thing back again when I desire it.
waltwhitman,"In vain the speeding or shyness,"
waltwhitman,"In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,"
waltwhitman,"In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd bones,"
waltwhitman,"In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,"
waltwhitman,"In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,"
waltwhitman,"In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,"
waltwhitman,"In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,"
waltwhitman,"In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,"
waltwhitman,"In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,"
waltwhitman,"I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff."
waltwhitman,32
waltwhitman,"I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and"
waltwhitman,"self-contain'd,"
waltwhitman,I stand and look at them long and long.
waltwhitman,"They do not sweat and whine about their condition,"
waltwhitman,"They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,"
waltwhitman,"They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,"
waltwhitman,"Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of"
waltwhitman,"owning things,"
waltwhitman,"Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of"
waltwhitman,"years ago,"
waltwhitman,Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.
waltwhitman,"So they show their relations to me and I accept them,"
waltwhitman,"They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their"
waltwhitman,possession.
waltwhitman,"I wonder where they get those tokens,"
waltwhitman,Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?
waltwhitman,"Myself moving forward then and now and forever,"
waltwhitman,"Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,"
waltwhitman,"Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,"
waltwhitman,"Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,"
waltwhitman,"Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms."
waltwhitman,"A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,"
waltwhitman,"Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,"
waltwhitman,"Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,"
waltwhitman,"Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving."
waltwhitman,"His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,"
waltwhitman,His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.
waltwhitman,"I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,"
waltwhitman,Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?
waltwhitman,Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.
waltwhitman,33
waltwhitman,"Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,"
waltwhitman,"What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,"
waltwhitman,"What I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,"
waltwhitman,And again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the morning.
waltwhitman,"My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,"
waltwhitman,"I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,"
waltwhitman,I am afoot with my vision.
waltwhitman,"By the city's quadrangular houses--in log huts, camping with lumber-men,"
waltwhitman,"Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,"
waltwhitman,"Weeding my onion-patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips,"
waltwhitman,"crossing savannas, trailing in forests,"
waltwhitman,"Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,"
waltwhitman,"Scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the"
waltwhitman,"shallow river,"
waltwhitman,"Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the"
waltwhitman,"buck turns furiously at the hunter,"
waltwhitman,"Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the"
waltwhitman,"otter is feeding on fish,"
waltwhitman,"Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,"
waltwhitman,"Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the"
waltwhitman,beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tall;
waltwhitman,"Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton plant, over"
waltwhitman,"the rice in its low moist field,"
waltwhitman,"Over the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum and"
waltwhitman,"slender shoots from the gutters,"
waltwhitman,"Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over the"
waltwhitman,"delicate blue-flower flax,"
waltwhitman,"Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with"
waltwhitman,"the rest,"
waltwhitman,Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;
waltwhitman,"Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low"
waltwhitman,"scragged limbs,"
waltwhitman,"Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,"
waltwhitman,"Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,"
waltwhitman,"Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great"
waltwhitman,"goldbug drops through the dark,"
waltwhitman,Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to
waltwhitman,"the meadow,"
waltwhitman,Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous
waltwhitman,"shuddering of their hides,"
waltwhitman,"Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle"
waltwhitman,"the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;"
waltwhitman,"Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,"
waltwhitman,"Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,"
waltwhitman,"Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it"
waltwhitman,"myself and looking composedly down,)"
waltwhitman,"Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat"

waltwhitman,"Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,"
waltwhitman,"Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,"
waltwhitman,"Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,"
waltwhitman,"Where the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,"
waltwhitman,"Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;"
waltwhitman,"Where the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the regiments,"
waltwhitman,"Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,"
waltwhitman,"Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,"
waltwhitman,"Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,"
waltwhitman,"Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of"
waltwhitman,"base-ball,"
waltwhitman,"At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,"
waltwhitman,"bull-dances, drinking, laughter,"
waltwhitman,"At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the"
waltwhitman,"juice through a straw,"
waltwhitman,"At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,"
waltwhitman,"At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;"

waltwhitman,Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles
waltwhitman,"far and near,"
waltwhitman,"Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived"
waltwhitman,"swan is curving and winding,"
waltwhitman,"Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her"
waltwhitman,"near-human laugh,"
waltwhitman,Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the
waltwhitman,"high weeds,"
waltwhitman,Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with
waltwhitman,"their heads out,"
waltwhitman,"Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,"
waltwhitman,"Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,"

waltwhitman,"night and feeds upon small crabs,"
waltwhitman,"Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,"
waltwhitman,Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over
waltwhitman,"the well,"
waltwhitman,"Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,"
waltwhitman,"Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,"
waltwhitman,"Through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon, through the"

waltwhitman,"Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,"
waltwhitman,"Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher,"
waltwhitman,impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;
waltwhitman,"Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon,"
waltwhitman,"flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,"
waltwhitman,"Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the clouds,"
waltwhitman,"or down a lane or along the beach,"
waltwhitman,"My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;"
waltwhitman,"Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy, (behind me"
waltwhitman,"he rides at the drape of the day,)"
waltwhitman,"Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet, or the"
waltwhitman,"moccasin print,"
waltwhitman,"By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,"
waltwhitman,"Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;"
waltwhitman,"Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,"
waltwhitman,"Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,"
waltwhitman,"Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,"
waltwhitman,"Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,"
waltwhitman,"Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side,"
waltwhitman,"Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,"
waltwhitman,"Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the"
waltwhitman,"diameter of eighty thousand miles,"
waltwhitman,"Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,"
waltwhitman,"Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,"
waltwhitman,"Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,"
waltwhitman,"Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,"
waltwhitman,I tread day and night such roads.
waltwhitman,"I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,"
waltwhitman,And look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.
waltwhitman,"I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,"
waltwhitman,My course runs below the soundings of plummets.
waltwhitman,"I help myself to material and immaterial,"
waltwhitman,"No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me."
waltwhitman,"I anchor my ship for a little while only,"
waltwhitman,My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.
waltwhitman,"I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a"
waltwhitman,"pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue."
waltwhitman,"I ascend to the foretruck,"
waltwhitman,"I take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,"
waltwhitman,"We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,"
waltwhitman,"Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,"
waltwhitman,"The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is"
waltwhitman,"plain in all directions,"
waltwhitman,"The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my"
waltwhitman,"fancies toward them,"
waltwhitman,We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to
waltwhitman,"be engaged,"
waltwhitman,"We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still"
waltwhitman,"feet and caution,"
waltwhitman,"Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,"
waltwhitman,The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities
waltwhitman,of the globe.
waltwhitman,"I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,"
waltwhitman,"I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,"
waltwhitman,I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.
waltwhitman,"My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,"
waltwhitman,They fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.
waltwhitman,"I understand the large hearts of heroes,"
waltwhitman,"The courage of present times and all times,"
waltwhitman,How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the
waltwhitman,"steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,"
waltwhitman,"How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of"
waltwhitman,"days and faithful of nights,"
waltwhitman,"And chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will"
waltwhitman,not desert you;
waltwhitman,How he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days and
waltwhitman,"would not give it up,"
waltwhitman,"How he saved the drifting company at last,"
waltwhitman,How the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated from the
waltwhitman,"side of their prepared graves,"
waltwhitman,"How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the"
waltwhitman,sharp-lipp'd unshaved men;
waltwhitman,"All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,"
waltwhitman,"I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there."
waltwhitman,"The disdain and calmness of martyrs,"
waltwhitman,"The mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her"
waltwhitman,"children gazing on,"
waltwhitman,"The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,"
waltwhitman,"blowing, cover'd with sweat,"
waltwhitman,"The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous"
waltwhitman,"buckshot and the bullets,"
waltwhitman,All these I feel or am.
waltwhitman,"I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,"
waltwhitman,"Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,"
waltwhitman,"I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the"
waltwhitman,"ooze of my skin,"
waltwhitman,"I fall on the weeds and stones,"
waltwhitman,"The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,"
waltwhitman,Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.
waltwhitman,"Agonies are one of my changes of garments,"
waltwhitman,"I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the"
waltwhitman,"wounded person,"
waltwhitman,My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.
waltwhitman,"I am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,"
waltwhitman,"Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,"
waltwhitman,"Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,"
waltwhitman,"I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,"
waltwhitman,"They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth."
waltwhitman,"I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,"
waltwhitman,"Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,"
waltwhitman,"White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared"
waltwhitman,"of their fire-caps,"
waltwhitman,The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.
waltwhitman,"Distant and dead resuscitate,"
waltwhitman,"They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself."
waltwhitman,"I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,"
waltwhitman,I am there again.
waltwhitman,"Again the long roll of the drummers,"
waltwhitman,"Again the attacking cannon, mortars,"
waltwhitman,Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.
waltwhitman,"I take part, I see and hear the whole,"
waltwhitman,"The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,"
waltwhitman,"The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,"
waltwhitman,"Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,"
waltwhitman,"The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,"
waltwhitman,"The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air."
waltwhitman,"Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves"
waltwhitman,"with his hand,"
waltwhitman,He gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.
waltwhitman,34
waltwhitman,"Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,"
waltwhitman,"(I tell not the fall of Alamo,"
waltwhitman,"Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,"
waltwhitman,"The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)"
waltwhitman,'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve
waltwhitman,young men.
waltwhitman,Retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their baggage for
waltwhitman,"breastworks,"
waltwhitman,"Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their"
waltwhitman,"number, was the price they took in advance,"
waltwhitman,"Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,"
waltwhitman,"They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing and"
waltwhitman,"seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners of war."
waltwhitman,"They were the glory of the race of rangers,"
waltwhitman,"Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,"
waltwhitman,"Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,"
waltwhitman,"Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,"
waltwhitman,Not a single one over thirty years of age.
waltwhitman,The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and
waltwhitman,"massacred, it was beautiful early summer,"
waltwhitman,The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by eight.
waltwhitman,"None obey'd the command to kneel,"
waltwhitman,"Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,"
waltwhitman,"A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead"
waltwhitman,"lay together,"
waltwhitman,"The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,"
waltwhitman,"Some half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,"
waltwhitman,"These were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the blunts of muskets,"
waltwhitman,A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two more
waltwhitman,"came to release him,"
waltwhitman,The three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.
waltwhitman,At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;
waltwhitman,That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.
waltwhitman,35
waltwhitman,Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
waltwhitman,Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
waltwhitman,"List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it to me."
waltwhitman,"Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)"
waltwhitman,"His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,"
waltwhitman,"and never was, and never will be;"
waltwhitman,Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.
waltwhitman,"We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,"
waltwhitman,My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.
waltwhitman,"We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,"
waltwhitman,"On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,"
waltwhitman,killing all around and blowing up overhead.
waltwhitman,"Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,"
waltwhitman,"Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,"
waltwhitman,"and five feet of water reported,"
waltwhitman,The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold
waltwhitman,to give them a chance for themselves.
waltwhitman,"The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,"
waltwhitman,They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.
waltwhitman,"Our frigate takes fire,"
waltwhitman,The other asks if we demand quarter?
waltwhitman,If our colors are struck and the fighting done?
waltwhitman,"Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,"
waltwhitman,"We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part"
waltwhitman,of the fighting.
waltwhitman,"Only three guns are in use,"
waltwhitman,"One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's main-mast,"
waltwhitman,Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry and
waltwhitman,clear his decks.
waltwhitman,"The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially"
waltwhitman,"the main-top,"
waltwhitman,They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.
waltwhitman,"Not a moment's cease,"
waltwhitman,"The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine."
waltwhitman,"One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking."
waltwhitman,"Serene stands the little captain,"
waltwhitman,"He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,"
waltwhitman,His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.
waltwhitman,Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.
waltwhitman,36
waltwhitman,"Stretch'd and still lies the midnight,"
waltwhitman,"Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,"
waltwhitman,"Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the"
waltwhitman,"one we have conquer'd,"
waltwhitman,The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a
waltwhitman,"countenance white as a sheet,"
waltwhitman,"Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,"
waltwhitman,The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully
waltwhitman,"curl'd whiskers,"
waltwhitman,"The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,"
waltwhitman,"The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,"
waltwhitman,"Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh"
waltwhitman,"upon the masts and spars,"
waltwhitman,"Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,"
waltwhitman,"Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,"
waltwhitman,"A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,"
waltwhitman,"Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by"
waltwhitman,"the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,"
waltwhitman,"The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,"
waltwhitman,"Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long,"
waltwhitman,"dull, tapering groan,"
waltwhitman,"These so, these irretrievable."
waltwhitman,37
waltwhitman,You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!
waltwhitman,In at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!
waltwhitman,"Embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,"
waltwhitman,"See myself in prison shaped like another man,"
waltwhitman,And feel the dull unintermitted pain.
waltwhitman,"For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,"
waltwhitman,It is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.
waltwhitman,Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd to him
waltwhitman,"and walk by his side,"
waltwhitman,"(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat"
waltwhitman,on my twitching lips.)
waltwhitman,"Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried"
waltwhitman,and sentenced.
waltwhitman,"Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,"
waltwhitman,"My face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat."
waltwhitman,"Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,"
waltwhitman,"I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg."
waltwhitman,38
waltwhitman,Enough! enough! enough!
waltwhitman,Somehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!
waltwhitman,"Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,"
waltwhitman,I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.
waltwhitman,That I could forget the mockers and insults!
waltwhitman,That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the
waltwhitman,bludgeons and hammers!
waltwhitman,That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and
waltwhitman,bloody crowning.
waltwhitman,"I remember now,"
waltwhitman,"I resume the overstaid fraction,"
waltwhitman,"The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,"
waltwhitman,"Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me."
waltwhitman,"I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an average"
waltwhitman,"unending procession,"
waltwhitman,"Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,"
waltwhitman,"Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,"
waltwhitman,The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.
waltwhitman,"Eleves, I salute you! come forward!"
waltwhitman,"Continue your annotations, continue your questionings."
waltwhitman,39
waltwhitman,"The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?"
waltwhitman,"Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?"
waltwhitman,Is he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian?
waltwhitman,"Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?"
waltwhitman,"The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?"
waltwhitman,"Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,"
waltwhitman,"They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them."
waltwhitman,"Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb'd"
waltwhitman,"head, laughter, and naivete,"
waltwhitman,"Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations,"
waltwhitman,"They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,"
waltwhitman,"They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of"
waltwhitman,the glance of his eyes.
waltwhitman,40
waltwhitman,Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask--lie over!
waltwhitman,"You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also."
waltwhitman,"Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,"
waltwhitman,"Say, old top-knot, what do you want?"
waltwhitman,"Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,"
waltwhitman,"And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,"
waltwhitman,"And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and days."
waltwhitman,"Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,"
waltwhitman,When I give I give myself.
waltwhitman,"You there, impotent, loose in the knees,"
waltwhitman,"Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,"
waltwhitman,"Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,"
waltwhitman,"I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,"
waltwhitman,And any thing I have I bestow.
waltwhitman,"I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,"
waltwhitman,You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.
waltwhitman,"To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,"
waltwhitman,"On his right cheek I put the family kiss,"
waltwhitman,And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.
waltwhitman,On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes.
waltwhitman,(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)
waltwhitman,"To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door."
waltwhitman,"Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,"
waltwhitman,Let the physician and the priest go home.
waltwhitman,"I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,"
waltwhitman,"O despairer, here is my neck,"
waltwhitman,"By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me."
waltwhitman,"I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,"
waltwhitman,"Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,"
waltwhitman,"Lovers of me, bafflers of graves."
waltwhitman,"Sleep--I and they keep guard all night,"
waltwhitman,"Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,"
waltwhitman,"I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,"
waltwhitman,And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.

waltwhitman,"I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,"
waltwhitman,And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.
waltwhitman,"I heard what was said of the universe,"
waltwhitman,Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;
waltwhitman,It is middling well as far as it goes--but is that all?
waltwhitman,"Magnifying and applying come I,"
waltwhitman,"Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,"
waltwhitman,"Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,"
waltwhitman,"Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,"
waltwhitman,"Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,"

waltwhitman,"Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,"
waltwhitman,"Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,"
waltwhitman,(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise and fly
waltwhitman,"and sing for themselves,)"

waltwhitman,"bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,"
waltwhitman,"Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,"
waltwhitman,Putting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves
waltwhitman,"driving the mallet and chisel,"
waltwhitman,"Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or"
waltwhitman,"a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation,"
waltwhitman,Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me
waltwhitman,"than the gods of the antique wars,"
waltwhitman,"Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,"
waltwhitman,"Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their white"
waltwhitman,foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;
waltwhitman,By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for
waltwhitman,"every person born,"
waltwhitman,Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels
waltwhitman,"with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,"
waltwhitman,"The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come,"
waltwhitman,"Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his"

waltwhitman,"not filling the square rod then,"
waltwhitman,"The bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,"
waltwhitman,"Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,"
waltwhitman,"The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of"

waltwhitman,"Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his prelude on"

waltwhitman,"My head slues round on my neck,"
waltwhitman,"Music rolls, but not from the organ,"
waltwhitman,"Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine."
waltwhitman,"Ever the hard unsunk ground,"
waltwhitman,"Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever"
waltwhitman,"the air and the ceaseless tides,"
waltwhitman,"Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,"
waltwhitman,"Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb, that"

waltwhitman,"and bring him forth,"
waltwhitman,"Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,"
waltwhitman,"Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death."
waltwhitman,"Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,"
waltwhitman,"To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,"
waltwhitman,"Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going,"
waltwhitman,"Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment"
waltwhitman,"receiving,"
waltwhitman,"A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming."
waltwhitman,"This is the city and I am one of the citizens,"
waltwhitman,"Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets,"

waltwhitman,And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.
waltwhitman,"Not words of routine this song of mine,"
waltwhitman,"But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;"
waltwhitman,This printed and bound book--but the printer and the
waltwhitman,printing-office boy?
waltwhitman,The well-taken photographs--but your wife or friend close and solid
waltwhitman,in your arms?
waltwhitman,"The black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets--but"
waltwhitman,the pluck of the captain and engineers?
waltwhitman,In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture--but the host and
waltwhitman,"hostess, and the look out of their eyes?"
waltwhitman,"The sky up there--yet here or next door, or across the way?"
waltwhitman,The saints and sages in history--but you yourself?
waltwhitman,"Sermons, creeds, theology--but the fathomless human brain,"
waltwhitman,And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?
waltwhitman,43
waltwhitman,"I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,"

waltwhitman,Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.
waltwhitman,One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like
waltwhitman,man leaving charges before a journey.
waltwhitman,"Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded,"
waltwhitman,"Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd, atheistical,"

waltwhitman,It is time to explain myself--let us stand up.
waltwhitman,"What is known I strip away,"

waltwhitman,The clock indicates the moment--but what does eternity indicate?
waltwhitman,"We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,"
waltwhitman,"There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them."
waltwhitman,"Births have brought us richness and variety,"
waltwhitman,And other births will bring us richness and variety.
waltwhitman,"I do not call one greater and one smaller,"

waltwhitman,"Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,"
waltwhitman,"I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,"
waltwhitman,"And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon."
waltwhitman,Long I was hugg'd close--long and long.
waltwhitman,"Immense have been the preparations for me,"
waltwhitman,Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.
waltwhitman,"Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,"
waltwhitman,"For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,"

waltwhitman,"My lovers suffocate me,"
waltwhitman,"Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,"
waltwhitman,"Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,"
waltwhitman,"Crying by day, Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and"
waltwhitman,"chirping over my head,"
waltwhitman,"Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,"
waltwhitman,"Lighting on every moment of my life,"
waltwhitman,"Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,"

waltwhitman,And the dark hush promulges as much as any.
waltwhitman,"I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,"
waltwhitman,And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of
waltwhitman,the farther systems.
waltwhitman,"Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,"
waltwhitman,Outward and outward and forever outward.
waltwhitman,"My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,"
waltwhitman,"He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,"
waltwhitman,"And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them."
waltwhitman,"There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,"
waltwhitman,"If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,"
waltwhitman,"were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would"
waltwhitman,"not avail the long run,"
waltwhitman,"We should surely bring up again where we now stand,"
waltwhitman,"And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther."
waltwhitman,"A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do"
waltwhitman,"not hazard the span or make it impatient,"
waltwhitman,"They are but parts, any thing is but a part."
waltwhitman,"See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,"
waltwhitman,"Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that."
waltwhitman,"My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,"
waltwhitman,"The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,"
waltwhitman,"The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there."
waltwhitman,46
waltwhitman,"I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and"
waltwhitman,never will be measured.
waltwhitman,"I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)"
waltwhitman,"My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods,"
waltwhitman,"No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,"
waltwhitman,"I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,"
waltwhitman,"I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,"
waltwhitman,"But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,"
waltwhitman,"My left hand hooking you round the waist,"
waltwhitman,My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.
waltwhitman,"Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,"
waltwhitman,You must travel it for yourself.
waltwhitman,"It is not far, it is within reach,"
waltwhitman,"Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,"
waltwhitman,Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.
waltwhitman,"Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,"
waltwhitman,Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.
waltwhitman,"If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand"
waltwhitman,"on my hip,"
waltwhitman,"And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,"
waltwhitman,For after we start we never lie by again.
waltwhitman,"This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the crowded heaven,"
waltwhitman,"And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs,"
waltwhitman,"and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we"
waltwhitman,be fill'd and satisfied then?
waltwhitman,"And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond."
waltwhitman,"You are also asking me questions and I hear you,"
waltwhitman,"I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself."
waltwhitman,"Sit a while dear son,"
waltwhitman,"Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,"
waltwhitman,"But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you"
waltwhitman,with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.
waltwhitman,"Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,"
waltwhitman,"Now I wash the gum from your eyes,"
waltwhitman,You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every
waltwhitman,moment of your life.
waltwhitman,"Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,"
waltwhitman,"Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,"
waltwhitman,"To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout,"
waltwhitman,and laughingly dash with your hair.
waltwhitman,47
waltwhitman,"I am the teacher of athletes,"
waltwhitman,"He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,"
waltwhitman,He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.
waltwhitman,"The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power,"
waltwhitman,"but in his own right,"
waltwhitman,"Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,"
waltwhitman,"Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,"
waltwhitman,"Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts,"
waltwhitman,"First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a"
waltwhitman,"skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo,"
waltwhitman,Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over
waltwhitman,"all latherers,"
waltwhitman,And those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.
waltwhitman,"I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?"
waltwhitman,"I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,"
waltwhitman,My words itch at your ears till you understand them.
waltwhitman,I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while
waltwhitman,"I wait for a boat,"
waltwhitman,"(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of you,"
waltwhitman,"Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)"
waltwhitman,"I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,"
waltwhitman,"And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her"
waltwhitman,who privately stays with me in the open air.
waltwhitman,"If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,"
waltwhitman,"The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves key,"
waltwhitman,"The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words."
waltwhitman,"No shutter'd room or school can commune with me,"
waltwhitman,But roughs and little children better than they.
waltwhitman,"The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,"
waltwhitman,The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with
waltwhitman,"him all day,"
waltwhitman,"The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,"
waltwhitman,"In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen"
waltwhitman,and love them.
waltwhitman,"The soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,"
waltwhitman,"On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,"
waltwhitman,On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.
waltwhitman,"My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in his blanket,"
waltwhitman,"The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,"
waltwhitman,"The young mother and old mother comprehend me,"
waltwhitman,"The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,"
waltwhitman,They and all would resume what I have told them.
waltwhitman,48
waltwhitman,"I have said that the soul is not more than the body,"
waltwhitman,"And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,"
waltwhitman,"And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,"
waltwhitman,And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own
waltwhitman,"funeral drest in his shroud,"
waltwhitman,"And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,"
waltwhitman,And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the
waltwhitman,"learning of all times,"
waltwhitman,And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it
waltwhitman,"may become a hero,"
waltwhitman,"And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd universe,"
waltwhitman,"And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed"
waltwhitman,before a million universes.
waltwhitman,"And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,"
waltwhitman,"For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,"
waltwhitman,(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and
waltwhitman,about death.)
waltwhitman,"I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,"
waltwhitman,Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.
waltwhitman,Why should I wish to see God better than this day?
waltwhitman,"I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,"
waltwhitman,"In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,"
waltwhitman,"I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign'd"
waltwhitman,"by God's name,"
waltwhitman,"And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er I go,"
waltwhitman,Others will punctually come for ever and ever.
waltwhitman,49
waltwhitman,"And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to"
waltwhitman,try to alarm me.
waltwhitman,"To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,"
waltwhitman,"I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,"
waltwhitman,"I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,"
waltwhitman,"And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape."
waltwhitman,"And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not"
waltwhitman,"offend me,"
waltwhitman,"I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,"
waltwhitman,"I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of melons."
waltwhitman,"And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,"
waltwhitman,(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)
waltwhitman,"I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,"
waltwhitman,"O suns--O grass of graves--O perpetual transfers and promotions,"
waltwhitman,If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?
waltwhitman,"Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,"
waltwhitman,"Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,"
waltwhitman,"Toss, sparkles of day and dusk--toss on the black stems that decay"
waltwhitman,"in the muck,"
waltwhitman,Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.
waltwhitman,"I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,"
waltwhitman,"I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,"
waltwhitman,And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.
waltwhitman,50
waltwhitman,There is that in me--I do not know what it is--but I know it is in me.
waltwhitman,"Wrench'd and sweaty--calm and cool then my body becomes,"
waltwhitman,I sleep--I sleep long.
waltwhitman,"I do not know it--it is without name--it is a word unsaid,"
waltwhitman,"It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol."
waltwhitman,"Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,"
waltwhitman,To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.
waltwhitman,Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.
waltwhitman,Do you see O my brothers and sisters?
waltwhitman,"It is not chaos or death--it is form, union, plan--it is eternal"
waltwhitman,life--it is Happiness.
waltwhitman,51
waltwhitman,"The past and present wilt--I have fill'd them, emptied them."
waltwhitman,And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.
waltwhitman,Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
waltwhitman,"Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,"
waltwhitman,"(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)"
waltwhitman,Do I contradict myself?
waltwhitman,"Very well then I contradict myself,"
waltwhitman,"(I am large, I contain multitudes.)"
waltwhitman,"I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab."
waltwhitman,Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his supper?
waltwhitman,Who wishes to walk with me?
waltwhitman,Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?
waltwhitman,52
waltwhitman,"The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab"
waltwhitman,and my loitering.
waltwhitman,"I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,"
waltwhitman,I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.
waltwhitman,"The last scud of day holds back for me,"
waltwhitman,"It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow'd wilds,"
waltwhitman,It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.
waltwhitman,"I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,"
waltwhitman,"I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags."
waltwhitman,"I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,"
waltwhitman,If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.
waltwhitman,"You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,"
waltwhitman,"But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,"
waltwhitman,And filter and fibre your blood.
waltwhitman,"Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,"
waltwhitman,"Missing me one place search another,"
waltwhitman,I stop somewhere waiting for you.

waltwhitman,"From native moments, from bashful pains, singing them,"
waltwhitman,Seeking something yet unfound though I have diligently sought it
waltwhitman,"many a long year,"
waltwhitman,"Singing the true song of the soul fitful at random,"
waltwhitman,"Renascent with grossest Nature or among animals,"
waltwhitman,"Of that, of them and what goes with them my poems informing,"
waltwhitman,"Of the smell of apples and lemons, of the pairing of birds,"
waltwhitman,"Of the wet of woods, of the lapping of waves,"

waltwhitman,I Sing the Body Electric
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"I sing the body electric,"
waltwhitman,"The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,"
waltwhitman,"They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,"
waltwhitman,"And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul."
waltwhitman,Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves?
waltwhitman,And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?
waltwhitman,And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?
waltwhitman,"And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?"
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself"
waltwhitman,"balks account,"
waltwhitman,"That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect."
waltwhitman,"The expression of the face balks account,"
waltwhitman,"But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,"
waltwhitman,"It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of"
waltwhitman,"his hips and wrists,"
waltwhitman,"It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist"
waltwhitman,"and knees, dress does not hide him,"
waltwhitman,"The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,"
waltwhitman,"To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,"
waltwhitman,"You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side."
waltwhitman,"The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the"
waltwhitman,"folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the"
waltwhitman,"contour of their shape downwards,"
waltwhitman,"The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through"
waltwhitman,"the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls"
waltwhitman,"silently to and from the heave of the water,"
waltwhitman,"The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the"
waltwhitman,"horse-man in his saddle,"
waltwhitman,"Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,"
waltwhitman,The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open
waltwhitman,"dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,"
waltwhitman,"The female soothing a child, the farmer's daughter in the garden or"
waltwhitman,"cow-yard,"
waltwhitman,"The young fellow hosing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six"
waltwhitman,"horses through the crowd,"
waltwhitman,"The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty,"
waltwhitman,"good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown after work,"
waltwhitman,"The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,"
waltwhitman,"The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;"
waltwhitman,"The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine"
waltwhitman,"muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,"
waltwhitman,"The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes"
waltwhitman,"suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,"
waltwhitman,"The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv'd"
waltwhitman,neck and the counting;
waltwhitman,"Such-like I love--I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's"
waltwhitman,"breast with the little child,"
waltwhitman,"Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with"
waltwhitman,"the firemen, and pause, listen, count."
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,"
waltwhitman,"And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons."
waltwhitman,"This man was a wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,"
waltwhitman,"The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and"
waltwhitman,"beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness"
waltwhitman,"and breadth of his manners,"
waltwhitman,"These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,"
waltwhitman,"He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were"
waltwhitman,"massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,"
waltwhitman,"They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,"
waltwhitman,"They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,"
waltwhitman,"He drank water only, the blood show'd like scarlet through the"
waltwhitman,"clear-brown skin of his face,"
waltwhitman,"He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail'd his boat himself, he"
waltwhitman,"had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had"
waltwhitman,"fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,"
waltwhitman,"When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish,"
waltwhitman,"you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,"
waltwhitman,"You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit"
waltwhitman,by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough,"
waltwhitman,"To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,"
waltwhitman,"To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,"
waltwhitman,"To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly"
waltwhitman,"round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then?"
waltwhitman,"I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea."
waltwhitman,There is something in staying close to men and women and looking
waltwhitman,"on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well,"
waltwhitman,"All things please the soul, but these please the soul well."
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"This is the female form,"
waltwhitman,"A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,"
waltwhitman,"It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,"
waltwhitman,"I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor,"
waltwhitman,"all falls aside but myself and it,"
waltwhitman,"Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what"
waltwhitman,"was expected of heaven or fear'd of hell, are now consumed,"
waltwhitman,"Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response"
waltwhitman,"likewise ungovernable,"
waltwhitman,"Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all"
waltwhitman,"diffused, mine too diffused,"
waltwhitman,"Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling"
waltwhitman,"and deliciously aching,"
waltwhitman,"Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of"
waltwhitman,"love, white-blow and delirious nice,"
waltwhitman,"Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,"
waltwhitman,"Undulating into the willing and yielding day,"
waltwhitman,Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh'd day.
waltwhitman,"This the nucleus--after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman,"
waltwhitman,"This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the"
waltwhitman,outlet again.
waltwhitman,"Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the"
waltwhitman,"exit of the rest,"
waltwhitman,"You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul."
waltwhitman,"The female contains all qualities and tempers them,"
waltwhitman,"She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,"
waltwhitman,"She is all things duly veil'd, she is both passive and active,"
waltwhitman,"She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters."
waltwhitman,"As I see my soul reflected in Nature,"
waltwhitman,"As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness,"
waltwhitman,"sanity, beauty,"
waltwhitman,"See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see."
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,"The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,"
waltwhitman,"He too is all qualities, he is action and power,"
waltwhitman,"The flush of the known universe is in him,"
waltwhitman,"Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,"
waltwhitman,"The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is"
waltwhitman,"utmost become him well, pride is for him,"
waltwhitman,"The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,"
waltwhitman,"Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to"
waltwhitman,"the test of himself,"
waltwhitman,"Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes"
waltwhitman,"soundings at last only here,"
waltwhitman,(Where else does he strike soundings except here?)
waltwhitman,"The man's body is sacred and the woman's body is sacred,"
waltwhitman,"No matter who it is, it is sacred--is it the meanest one in the"
waltwhitman,laborers' gang?
waltwhitman,Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?
waltwhitman,"Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as"
waltwhitman,"much as you,"
waltwhitman,Each has his or her place in the procession.
waltwhitman,"(All is a procession,"
waltwhitman,The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)
waltwhitman,Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?
waltwhitman,"Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has"
waltwhitman,no right to a sight?
waltwhitman,"Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and"
waltwhitman,"the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,"
waltwhitman,"For you only, and not for him and her?"
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,"A man's body at auction,"
waltwhitman,"(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,)"
waltwhitman,"I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business."
waltwhitman,"Gentlemen look on this wonder,"
waltwhitman,"Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it,"
waltwhitman,For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one
waltwhitman,"animal or plant,"
waltwhitman,For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd.

waltwhitman,The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked
waltwhitman,"meat of the body,"
waltwhitman,"The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out,"
waltwhitman,"The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward"

waltwhitman,"Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex,"
waltwhitman,Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.
waltwhitman,"Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,"
waltwhitman,"I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women that"
waltwhitman,"are warm-blooded and sufficient for me,"
waltwhitman,"I see that they understand me and do not deny me,"
waltwhitman,"I see that they are worthy of me, I will be the robust husband of"
waltwhitman,those women.
waltwhitman,"They are not one jot less than I am,"
waltwhitman,"They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,"

waltwhitman,"The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder,"
waltwhitman,"The hillside whiten'd with blossoms of the mountain ash,"
waltwhitman,"The same late in autumn, the hues of red, yellow, drab, purple, and"
waltwhitman,"light and dark green,"
waltwhitman,"The rich coverlet of the grass, animals and birds, the private"
waltwhitman,"untrimm'd bank, the primitive apples, the pebble-stones,"
waltwhitman,"Beautiful dripping fragments, the negligent list of one after"
waltwhitman,"another as I happen to call them to me or think of them,"
waltwhitman,"The real poems, (what we call poems being merely pictures,)"
waltwhitman,"The poems of the privacy of the night, and of men like me,"
waltwhitman,"This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry, and that all"

waltwhitman,"of love, bellies press'd and glued together with love,"
waltwhitman,"Earth of chaste love, life that is only life after love,"
waltwhitman,"The body of my love, the body of the woman I love, the body of the"
waltwhitman,"man, the body of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"Soft forenoon airs that blow from the south-west,"
waltwhitman,"The hairy wild-bee that murmurs and hankers up and down, that gripes the"
waltwhitman,"full-grown lady-flower, curves upon her with amorous firm legs, takes"
waltwhitman,"his will of her, and holds himself tremulous and tight till he is"
waltwhitman,satisfied;
waltwhitman,"The wet of woods through the early hours,"
waltwhitman,"Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep, one with"
waltwhitman,"an arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other,"
waltwhitman,"The smell of apples, aromas from crush'd sage-plant, mint, birch-bark,"
waltwhitman,"The boy's longings, the glow and pressure as he confides to me what"
waltwhitman,"he was dreaming,"
waltwhitman,The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and
waltwhitman,"content to the ground,"
waltwhitman,"The no-form'd stings that sights, people, objects, sting me with,"
waltwhitman,"The hubb'd sting of myself, stinging me as much as it ever can any"
waltwhitman,"one,"
waltwhitman,"The sensitive, orbic, underlapp'd brothers, that only privileged"
waltwhitman,"feelers may be intimate where they are,"
waltwhitman,"The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body, the bashful"
waltwhitman,withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and
waltwhitman,"edge themselves,"
waltwhitman,"The limpid liquid within the young man,"
waltwhitman,"The vex'd corrosion so pensive and so painful,"
waltwhitman,"The torment, the irritable tide that will not be at rest,"
waltwhitman,"The like of the same I feel, the like of the same in others,"
waltwhitman,"The young man that flushes and flushes, and the young woman that"
waltwhitman,"flushes and flushes,"
waltwhitman,"The young man that wakes deep at night, the hot hand seeking to"
waltwhitman,"repress what would master him,"
waltwhitman,"The mystic amorous night, the strange half-welcome pangs, visions, sweats,"
waltwhitman,"The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers,"
waltwhitman,"the young man all color'd, red, ashamed, angry;"
waltwhitman,"The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as I lie willing and naked,"
waltwhitman,The merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the
waltwhitman,"sun, the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them,"
waltwhitman,"The walnut-trunk, the walnut-husks, and the ripening or ripen'd"
waltwhitman,"long-round walnuts,"
waltwhitman,"The continence of vegetables, birds, animals,"
waltwhitman,"The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent,"
waltwhitman,"while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent,"
waltwhitman,"The great chastity of paternity, to match the great chastity of maternity,"
waltwhitman,"The oath of procreation I have sworn, my Adamic and fresh daughters,"
waltwhitman,"The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw, till I saturate"
waltwhitman,"what shall produce boys to fill my place when I am through,"
waltwhitman,"The wholesome relief, repose, content,"
waltwhitman,"And this bunch pluck'd at random from myself,"
waltwhitman,It has done its work--I toss it carelessly to fall where it may.
waltwhitman,One Hour to Madness and Joy
waltwhitman,One hour to madness and joy! O furious! O confine me not!
waltwhitman,(What is this that frees me so in storms?
waltwhitman,What do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean?)
waltwhitman,O to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man!
waltwhitman,"O savage and tender achings! (I bequeath them to you my children,"
waltwhitman,"I tell them to you, for reasons, O bridegroom and bride.)"
waltwhitman,"O to be yielded to you whoever you are, and you to be yielded to me"
waltwhitman,in defiance of the world!
waltwhitman,O to return to Paradise! O bashful and feminine!
waltwhitman,"O to draw you to me, to plant on you for the first time the lips of"
waltwhitman,a determin'd man.
waltwhitman,"O the puzzle, the thrice-tied knot, the deep and dark pool, all"
waltwhitman,untied and illumin'd!
waltwhitman,O to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last!
waltwhitman,"To be absolv'd from previous ties and conventions, I from mine and"
waltwhitman,you from yours!
waltwhitman,To find a new unthought-of nonchalance with the best of Nature!
waltwhitman,To have the gag remov'd from one's mouth!
waltwhitman,To have the feeling to-day or any day I am sufficient as I am.
waltwhitman,O something unprov'd! something in a trance!
waltwhitman,To escape utterly from others' anchors and holds!
waltwhitman,To drive free! to love free! to dash reckless and dangerous!
waltwhitman,"To court destruction with taunts, with invitations!"
waltwhitman,"To ascend, to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me!"
waltwhitman,To rise thither with my inebriate soul!
waltwhitman,To be lost if it must be so!
waltwhitman,To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom!
waltwhitman,With one brief hour of madness and joy.
waltwhitman,Out of the Rolling Ocean the Crowd
waltwhitman,"Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me,"
waltwhitman,"Whispering I love you, before long I die,"
waltwhitman,"I have travel'd a long way merely to look on you to touch you,"
waltwhitman,"For I could not die till I once look'd on you,"
waltwhitman,For I fear'd I might afterward lose you.
waltwhitman,"Now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe,"
waltwhitman,"Return in peace to the ocean my love,"
waltwhitman,"I too am part of that ocean my love, we are not so much separated,"
waltwhitman,"Behold the great rondure, the cohesion of all, how perfect!"
waltwhitman,"But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,"
waltwhitman,"As for an hour carrying us diverse, yet cannot carry us diverse forever;"
waltwhitman,"Be not impatient--a little space--know you I salute the air, the"
waltwhitman,"ocean and the land,"
waltwhitman,Every day at sundown for your dear sake my love.
waltwhitman,Ages and Ages Returning at Intervals
waltwhitman,"Ages and ages returning at intervals,"
waltwhitman,"Undestroy'd, wandering immortal,"
waltwhitman,"Lusty, phallic, with the potent original loins, perfectly sweet,"
waltwhitman,"I, chanter of Adamic songs,"
waltwhitman,"Through the new garden the West, the great cities calling,"
waltwhitman,"Deliriate, thus prelude what is generated, offering these, offering myself,"
waltwhitman,"Bathing myself, bathing my songs in Sex,"
waltwhitman,Offspring of my loins.
waltwhitman,"We Two, How Long We Were Fool'd"
waltwhitman,"We two, how long we were fool'd,"
waltwhitman,"Now transmuted, we swiftly escape as Nature escapes,"
waltwhitman,"We are Nature, long have we been absent, but now we return,"
waltwhitman,"We become plants, trunks, foliage, roots, bark,"
waltwhitman,"We are bedded in the ground, we are rocks,"
waltwhitman,"We are oaks, we grow in the openings side by side,"
waltwhitman,"We browse, we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any,"
waltwhitman,"We are two fishes swimming in the sea together,"
waltwhitman,"We are what locust blossoms are, we drop scent around lanes mornings"
waltwhitman,"and evenings,"
waltwhitman,"We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, minerals,"
waltwhitman,"We are two predatory hawks, we soar above and look down,"
waltwhitman,"We are two resplendent suns, we it is who balance ourselves orbic"
waltwhitman,"and stellar, we are as two comets,"
waltwhitman,"We prowl fang'd and four-footed in the woods, we spring on prey,"
waltwhitman,"We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead,"
waltwhitman,"We are seas mingling, we are two of those cheerful waves rolling"
waltwhitman,"over each other and interwetting each other,"
waltwhitman,"We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive, pervious, impervious,"
waltwhitman,"We are snow, rain, cold, darkness, we are each product and influence"
waltwhitman,"of the globe,"
waltwhitman,"We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again, we two,"
waltwhitman,We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy.
waltwhitman,O Hymen! O Hymenee!
waltwhitman,O hymen! O hymenee! why do you tantalize me thus?
waltwhitman,O why sting me for a swift moment only?
waltwhitman,Why can you not continue? O why do you now cease?
waltwhitman,Is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would
waltwhitman,soon certainly kill me?
waltwhitman,I Am He That Aches with Love
waltwhitman,I am he that aches with amorous love;
waltwhitman,"Does the earth gravitate? does not all matter, aching, attract all matter?"
waltwhitman,So the body of me to all I meet or know.
waltwhitman,Native Moments
waltwhitman,"Native moments--when you come upon me--ah you are here now,"
waltwhitman,"Give me now libidinous joys only,"
waltwhitman,"Give me the drench of my passions, give me life coarse and rank,"
waltwhitman,"To-day I go consort with Nature's darlings, to-night too,"
waltwhitman,"I am for those who believe in loose delights, I share the midnight"
waltwhitman,"orgies of young men,"
waltwhitman,"I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers,"
waltwhitman,"The echoes ring with our indecent calls, I pick out some low person"
waltwhitman,"for my dearest friend,"
waltwhitman,"He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate, he shall be one condemn'd by"
waltwhitman,"others for deeds done,"
waltwhitman,"I will play a part no longer, why should I exile myself from my companions?"
waltwhitman,"O you shunn'd persons, I at least do not shun you,"
waltwhitman,"I come forthwith in your midst, I will be your poet,"
waltwhitman,I will be more to you than to any of the rest.
waltwhitman,Once I Pass'd Through a Populous City
waltwhitman,Once I pass'd through a populous city imprinting my brain for future
waltwhitman,"use with its shows, architecture, customs, traditions,"
waltwhitman,Yet now of all that city I remember only a woman I casually met
waltwhitman,"there who detain'd me for love of me,"
waltwhitman,Day by day and night by night we were together--all else has long
waltwhitman,"been forgotten by me,"
waltwhitman,"I remember I say only that woman who passionately clung to me,"
waltwhitman,"Again we wander, we love, we separate again,"
waltwhitman,"Again she holds me by the hand, I must not go,"
waltwhitman,I see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous.
waltwhitman,I Heard You Solemn-Sweet Pipes of the Organ
waltwhitman,I heard you solemn-sweet pipes of the organ as last Sunday morn I
waltwhitman,"pass'd the church,"
waltwhitman,"Winds of autumn, as I walk'd the woods at dusk I heard your long-"
waltwhitman,"stretch'd sighs up above so mournful,"
waltwhitman,"I heard the perfect Italian tenor singing at the opera, I heard the"
waltwhitman,soprano in the midst of the quartet singing;
waltwhitman,Heart of my love! you too I heard murmuring low through one of the
waltwhitman,"wrists around my head,"
waltwhitman,Heard the pulse of you when all was still ringing little bells last
waltwhitman,night under my ear.
waltwhitman,Facing West from California's Shores
waltwhitman,"Facing west from California's shores,"
waltwhitman,"Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,"
waltwhitman,"I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,"
waltwhitman,"the land of migrations, look afar,"
waltwhitman,"Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;"
waltwhitman,"For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,"
waltwhitman,"From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,"
waltwhitman,"From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,"
waltwhitman,"Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,"
waltwhitman,"Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,"
waltwhitman,(But where is what I started for so long ago?
waltwhitman,And why is it yet unfound?)
waltwhitman,As Adam Early in the Morning
waltwhitman,"As Adam early in the morning,"
waltwhitman,"Walking forth from the bower refresh'd with sleep,"
waltwhitman,"Behold me where I pass, hear my voice, approach,"
waltwhitman,"Touch me, touch the palm of your hand to my body as I pass,"
waltwhitman,Be not afraid of my body.

waltwhitman,shall emerge again;
waltwhitman,O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale

waltwhitman,O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit you to tell in
waltwhitman,"your own way of the heart that is under you,"
waltwhitman,"O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves, you are"

waltwhitman,except death and love?)
waltwhitman,"O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers,"
waltwhitman,"I think it must be for death,"
waltwhitman,"For how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers,"
waltwhitman,"Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer,"

waltwhitman,"That may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very long,"
waltwhitman,But you will last very long.
waltwhitman,Whoever You Are Holding Me Now in Hand
waltwhitman,"Whoever you are holding me now in hand,"
waltwhitman,"Without one thing all will be useless,"
waltwhitman,"I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,"
waltwhitman,"I am not what you supposed, but far different."
waltwhitman,Who is he that would become my follower?
waltwhitman,Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?
waltwhitman,"The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,"
waltwhitman,"You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your"
waltwhitman,"sole and exclusive standard,"
waltwhitman,"Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,"
waltwhitman,The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives
waltwhitman,"around you would have to be abandon'd,"
waltwhitman,"Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let"
waltwhitman,"go your hand from my shoulders,"
waltwhitman,Put me down and depart on your way.
waltwhitman,"Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,"
waltwhitman,"Or back of a rock in the open air,"
waltwhitman,"(For in any roof'd room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,"
waltwhitman,"And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)"
waltwhitman,"But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any"
waltwhitman,"person for miles around approach unawares,"
waltwhitman,"Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or"
waltwhitman,"some quiet island,"
waltwhitman,"Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,"
waltwhitman,"With the comrade's long-dwelling kiss or the new husband's kiss,"
waltwhitman,For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.
waltwhitman,"Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,"
waltwhitman,"Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,"
waltwhitman,Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;
waltwhitman,"For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,"
waltwhitman,And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.
waltwhitman,"But these leaves conning you con at peril,"
waltwhitman,"For these leaves and me you will not understand,"
waltwhitman,"They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will"
waltwhitman,certainly elude you.
waltwhitman,"Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!"
waltwhitman,Already you see I have escaped from you.
waltwhitman,"For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,"
waltwhitman,"Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,"
waltwhitman,"Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,"
waltwhitman,Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few)
waltwhitman,"prove victorious,"
waltwhitman,"Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil,"
waltwhitman,"perhaps more,"
waltwhitman,For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times
waltwhitman,"and not hit, that which I hinted at;"
waltwhitman,Therefore release me and depart on your way.
waltwhitman,"For You, O Democracy"
waltwhitman,"Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,"
waltwhitman,"I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon,"
waltwhitman,"I will make divine magnetic lands,"
waltwhitman,"With the love of comrades,"
waltwhitman,With the life-long love of comrades.
waltwhitman,"I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America,"
waltwhitman,"and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies,"
waltwhitman,"I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each other's necks,"
waltwhitman,"By the love of comrades,"
waltwhitman,By the manly love of comrades.
waltwhitman,"For you these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!"
waltwhitman,"For you, for you I am trilling these songs."
waltwhitman,These I Singing in Spring
waltwhitman,"These I singing in spring collect for lovers,"
waltwhitman,(For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow and joy?
waltwhitman,And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)
waltwhitman,"Collecting I traverse the garden the world, but soon I pass the gates,"
waltwhitman,"Now along the pond-side, now wading in a little, fearing not the wet,"
waltwhitman,"Now by the post-and-rail fences where the old stones thrown there,"
waltwhitman,"pick'd from the fields, have accumulated,"
waltwhitman,(Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and
waltwhitman,"partly cover them, beyond these I pass,)"
waltwhitman,"Far, far in the forest, or sauntering later in summer, before I"
waltwhitman,"think where I go,"
waltwhitman,"Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence,"
waltwhitman,"Alone I had thought, yet soon a troop gathers around me,"
waltwhitman,"Some walk by my side and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,"
waltwhitman,"They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive, thicker they come, a"
waltwhitman,"great crowd, and I in the middle,"
waltwhitman,"Collecting, dispensing, singing, there I wander with them,"
waltwhitman,"Plucking something for tokens, tossing toward whoever is near me,"
waltwhitman,"Here, lilac, with a branch of pine,"
waltwhitman,"Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull'd off a live-oak in"
waltwhitman,"Florida as it hung trailing down,"
waltwhitman,"Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,"
waltwhitman,"And here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pondside,"
waltwhitman,"(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me, and returns again"
waltwhitman,"never to separate from me,"
waltwhitman,"And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades, this"
waltwhitman,"calamus-root shall,"
waltwhitman,Interchange it youths with each other! let none render it back!)
waltwhitman,"And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut,"
waltwhitman,"And stems of currants and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar,"
waltwhitman,"These I compass'd around by a thick cloud of spirits,"
waltwhitman,"Wandering, point to or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from me,"
waltwhitman,"Indicating to each one what he shall have, giving something to each;"
waltwhitman,"But what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I reserve,"
waltwhitman,"I will give of it, but only to them that love as I myself am capable"
waltwhitman,of loving.
waltwhitman,Not Heaving from My Ribb'd Breast Only
waltwhitman,"Not heaving from my ribb'd breast only,"
waltwhitman,"Not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself,"
waltwhitman,"Not in those long-drawn, ill-supprest sighs,"
waltwhitman,"Not in many an oath and promise broken,"
waltwhitman,"Not in my wilful and savage soul's volition,"
waltwhitman,"Not in the subtle nourishment of the air,"
waltwhitman,"Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists,"
waltwhitman,"Not in the curious systole and diastole within which will one day cease,"
waltwhitman,"Not in many a hungry wish told to the skies only,"
waltwhitman,"Not in cries, laughter, defiancies, thrown from me when alone far in"
waltwhitman,"the wilds,"
waltwhitman,"Not in husky pantings through clinch'd teeth,"
waltwhitman,"Not in sounded and resounded words, chattering words, echoes, dead words,"
waltwhitman,"Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day,"
waltwhitman,Nor in the limbs and senses of my body that take you and dismiss you
waltwhitman,"continually--not there,"
waltwhitman,Not in any or all of them O adhesiveness! O pulse of my life!
waltwhitman,Need I that you exist and show yourself any more than in these songs.
waltwhitman,Of the Terrible Doubt of Appearances
waltwhitman,"Of the terrible doubt of appearances,"
waltwhitman,"Of the uncertainty after all, that we may be deluded,"
waltwhitman,"That may-be reliance and hope are but speculations after all,"
waltwhitman,"That may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,"
waltwhitman,"May-be the things I perceive, the animals, plants, men, hills,"
waltwhitman,"shining and flowing waters,"
waltwhitman,"The skies of day and night, colors, densities, forms, may-be these"
waltwhitman,"are (as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real"
waltwhitman,"something has yet to be known,"
waltwhitman,(How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me!
waltwhitman,"How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught of them,)"
waltwhitman,May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem)
waltwhitman,"as from my present point of view, and might prove (as of course they"
waltwhitman,"would) nought of what they appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely"
waltwhitman,changed points of view;
waltwhitman,To me these and the like of these are curiously answer'd by my
waltwhitman,"lovers, my dear friends,"
waltwhitman,When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me
waltwhitman,"by the hand,"
waltwhitman,"When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason"
waltwhitman,"hold not, surround us and pervade us,"
waltwhitman,"Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom, I am silent, I"
waltwhitman,"require nothing further,"
waltwhitman,I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity
waltwhitman,"beyond the grave,"
waltwhitman,"But I walk or sit indifferent, I am satisfied,"
waltwhitman,He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.
waltwhitman,The Base of All Metaphysics
waltwhitman,"And now gentlemen,"
waltwhitman,"A word I give to remain in your memories and minds,"
waltwhitman,As base and finale too for all metaphysics.
waltwhitman,"(So to the students the old professor,"
waltwhitman,At the close of his crowded course.)
waltwhitman,"Having studied the new and antique, the Greek and Germanic systems,"
waltwhitman,"Kant having studied and stated, Fichte and Schelling and Hegel,"
waltwhitman,"Stated the lore of Plato, and Socrates greater than Plato,"
waltwhitman,"And greater than Socrates sought and stated, Christ divine having"
waltwhitman,"studied long,"
waltwhitman,"I see reminiscent to-day those Greek and Germanic systems,"
waltwhitman,"See the philosophies all, Christian churches and tenets see,"
waltwhitman,"Yet underneath Socrates clearly see, and underneath Christ the divine I see,"
waltwhitman,"The dear love of man for his comrade, the attraction of friend to friend,"
waltwhitman,"Of the well-married husband and wife, of children and parents,"
waltwhitman,Of city for city and land for land.
waltwhitman,Recorders Ages Hence
waltwhitman,"Recorders ages hence,"
waltwhitman,"Come, I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior, I"
waltwhitman,"will tell you what to say of me,"
waltwhitman,"Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover,"
waltwhitman,"The friend the lover's portrait, of whom his friend his lover was fondest,"
waltwhitman,"Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love"
waltwhitman,"within him, and freely pour'd it forth,"
waltwhitman,"Who often walk'd lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends, his lovers,"
waltwhitman,Who pensive away from one he lov'd often lay sleepless and
waltwhitman,"dissatisfied at night,"
waltwhitman,"Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he lov'd might"
waltwhitman,"secretly be indifferent to him,"
waltwhitman,"Whose happiest days were far away through fields, in woods, on hills,"
waltwhitman,"he and another wandering hand in hand, they twain apart from other men,"
waltwhitman,Who oft as he saunter'd the streets curv'd with his arm the shoulder
waltwhitman,"of his friend, while the arm of his friend rested upon him also."
waltwhitman,When I Heard at the Close of the Day
waltwhitman,When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv'd
waltwhitman,"with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for"
waltwhitman,"me that follow'd,"
waltwhitman,"And else when I carous'd, or when my plans were accomplish'd, still"
waltwhitman,"I was not happy,"
waltwhitman,"But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health,"
waltwhitman,"refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,"
waltwhitman,When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the
waltwhitman,"morning light,"
waltwhitman,"When I wander'd alone over the beach, and undressing bathed,"
waltwhitman,"laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,"
waltwhitman,And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way
waltwhitman,"coming, O then I was happy,"
waltwhitman,"O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food"
waltwhitman,"nourish'd me more, and the beautiful day pass'd well,"
waltwhitman,"And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening came"
waltwhitman,"my friend,"
waltwhitman,And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly
waltwhitman,"continually up the shores,"
waltwhitman,I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me
waltwhitman,"whispering to congratulate me,"
waltwhitman,For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in
waltwhitman,"the cool night,"
waltwhitman,"In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me,"
waltwhitman,And his arm lay lightly around my breast--and that night I was happy.
waltwhitman,Are You the New Person Drawn Toward Me?
waltwhitman,Are you the new person drawn toward me?
waltwhitman,"To begin with take warning, I am surely far different from what you suppose;"
waltwhitman,Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal?
waltwhitman,Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover?
waltwhitman,Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy'd satisfaction?
waltwhitman,Do you think I am trusty and faithful?
waltwhitman,"Do you see no further than this facade, this smooth and tolerant"
waltwhitman,manner of me?
waltwhitman,Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man?
waltwhitman,"Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya, illusion?"
waltwhitman,Roots and Leaves Themselves Alone
waltwhitman,"Roots and leaves themselves alone are these,"
waltwhitman,"Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and pond-side,"
waltwhitman,"Breast-sorrel and pinks of love, fingers that wind around tighter"
waltwhitman,"than vines,"
waltwhitman,Gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the
waltwhitman,"sun is risen,"
waltwhitman,Breezes of land and love set from living shores to you on the living
waltwhitman,"sea, to you O sailors!"
waltwhitman,Frost-mellow'd berries and Third-month twigs offer'd fresh to young
waltwhitman,"persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up,"
waltwhitman,"Love-buds put before you and within you whoever you are,"
waltwhitman,"Buds to be unfolded on the old terms,"
waltwhitman,If you bring the warmth of the sun to them they will open and bring
waltwhitman,"form, color, perfume, to you,"
waltwhitman,"If you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers,"
waltwhitman,"fruits, tall branches and trees."
waltwhitman,Not Heat Flames Up and Consumes
waltwhitman,"Not heat flames up and consumes,"
waltwhitman,"Not sea-waves hurry in and out,"
waltwhitman,"Not the air delicious and dry, the air of ripe summer, bears lightly"
waltwhitman,"along white down-balls of myriads of seeds,"
waltwhitman,"Waited, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may;"
waltwhitman,"Not these, O none of these more than the flames of me, consuming,"
waltwhitman,"burning for his love whom I love,"
waltwhitman,O none more than I hurrying in and out;
waltwhitman,"Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never give up? O I the same,"
waltwhitman,"O nor down-balls nor perfumes, nor the high rain-emitting clouds,"
waltwhitman,"are borne through the open air,"
waltwhitman,"Any more than my soul is borne through the open air,"
waltwhitman,"Wafted in all directions O love, for friendship, for you."
waltwhitman,Trickle Drops
waltwhitman,Trickle drops! my blue veins leaving!
waltwhitman,"O drops of me! trickle, slow drops,"
waltwhitman,"Candid from me falling, drip, bleeding drops,"
waltwhitman,"From wounds made to free you whence you were prison'd,"
waltwhitman,"From my face, from my forehead and lips,"
waltwhitman,"From my breast, from within where I was conceal'd, press forth red"
waltwhitman,"drops, confession drops,"
waltwhitman,"Stain every page, stain every song I sing, every word I say, bloody drops,"
waltwhitman,"Let them know your scarlet heat, let them glisten,"
waltwhitman,"Saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet,"
waltwhitman,"Glow upon all I have written or shall write, bleeding drops,"
waltwhitman,"Let it all be seen in your light, blushing drops."
waltwhitman,City of Orgies
waltwhitman,"City of orgies, walks and joys,"
waltwhitman,City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day make
waltwhitman,"Not the pageants of you, not your shifting tableaus, your"
waltwhitman,"spectacles, repay me,"
waltwhitman,"Not the interminable rows of your houses, nor the ships at the wharves,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the processions in the streets, nor the bright windows with"
waltwhitman,"goods in them,"
waltwhitman,"Nor to converse with learn'd persons, or bear my share in the soiree"
waltwhitman,or feast;
waltwhitman,"Not those, but as I pass O Manhattan, your frequent and swift flash"
waltwhitman,"of eyes offering me love,"
waltwhitman,"Offering response to my own--these repay me,"
waltwhitman,"Lovers, continual lovers, only repay me."
waltwhitman,Behold This Swarthy Face
waltwhitman,"Behold this swarthy face, these gray eyes,"
waltwhitman,"This beard, the white wool unclipt upon my neck,"
waltwhitman,My brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm;
waltwhitman,Yet comes one a Manhattanese and ever at parting kisses me lightly
waltwhitman,"on the lips with robust love,"
waltwhitman,And I on the crossing of the street or on the ship's deck give a
waltwhitman,"kiss in return,"
waltwhitman,"We observe that salute of American comrades land and sea,"
waltwhitman,We are those two natural and nonchalant persons.
waltwhitman,I Saw in Louisiana a Live-Oak Growing
waltwhitman,"I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing,"
waltwhitman,"All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,"
waltwhitman,"Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green,"
waltwhitman,"And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,"
waltwhitman,But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there
waltwhitman,"without its friend near, for I knew I could not,"
waltwhitman,And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and
waltwhitman,"twined around it a little moss,"
waltwhitman,"And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room,"
waltwhitman,"It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,"
waltwhitman,"(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)"
waltwhitman,"Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love;"
waltwhitman,"For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana"
waltwhitman,"solitary in a wide in a wide flat space,"
waltwhitman,"Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near,"
waltwhitman,I know very well I could not.
waltwhitman,To a Stranger
waltwhitman,"Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon you,"
waltwhitman,"You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, (it comes to me"
waltwhitman,"as of a dream,)"
waltwhitman,"I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you,"
waltwhitman,"All is recall'd as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate,"
waltwhitman,"chaste, matured,"
waltwhitman,"You grew up with me, were a boy with me or a girl with me,"
waltwhitman,"I ate with you and slept with you, your body has become not yours"
waltwhitman,"only nor left my body mine only,"
waltwhitman,"You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass, you"
waltwhitman,"take of my beard, breast, hands, in return,"
waltwhitman,"I am not to speak to you, I am to think of you when I sit alone or"
waltwhitman,"wake at night alone,"
waltwhitman,"I am to wait, I do not doubt I am to meet you again,"
waltwhitman,I am to see to it that I do not lose you.
waltwhitman,This Moment Yearning and Thoughtful
waltwhitman,"This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone,"
waltwhitman,"It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtful,"
waltwhitman,"It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Germany, Italy,"
waltwhitman,"France, Spain,"
waltwhitman,"Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or talking other dialects,"
waltwhitman,And it seems to me if I could know those men I should become
waltwhitman,"attached to them as I do to men in my own lands,"
waltwhitman,"O I know we should be brethren and lovers,"
waltwhitman,I know I should be happy with them.
waltwhitman,I Hear It Was Charged Against Me
waltwhitman,"I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions,"
waltwhitman,"But really I am neither for nor against institutions,"
waltwhitman,(What indeed have I in common with them? or what with the
waltwhitman,destruction of them?)
waltwhitman,Only I will establish in the Mannahatta and in every city of these
waltwhitman,"States inland and seaboard,"
waltwhitman,"And in the fields and woods, and above every keel little or large"
waltwhitman,"that dents the water,"
waltwhitman,"Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument,"
waltwhitman,The institution of the dear love of comrades.
waltwhitman,The Prairie-Grass Dividing
waltwhitman,"The prairie-grass dividing, its special odor breathing,"
waltwhitman,"I demand of it the spiritual corresponding,"
waltwhitman,"Demand the most copious and close companionship of men,"
waltwhitman,"Demand the blades to rise of words, acts, beings,"
waltwhitman,"Those of the open atmosphere, coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious,"
waltwhitman,"Those that go their own gait, erect, stepping with freedom and"
waltwhitman,"command, leading not following,"
waltwhitman,"Those with a never-quell'd audacity, those with sweet and lusty"
waltwhitman,"flesh clear of taint,"
waltwhitman,"Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governors,"
waltwhitman,as to say Who are you?
waltwhitman,"Those of earth-born passion, simple, never constrain'd, never obedient,"
waltwhitman,Those of inland America.
waltwhitman,When I Peruse the Conquer'd Fame
waltwhitman,When I peruse the conquer'd fame of heroes and the victories of
waltwhitman,"mighty generals, I do not envy the generals,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the President in his Presidency, nor the rich in his great house,"
waltwhitman,"But when I hear of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them,"
waltwhitman,"How together through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, long"
waltwhitman,"and long,"
waltwhitman,"Through youth and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, how"
waltwhitman,"affectionate and faithful they were,"
waltwhitman,Then I am pensive--I hastily walk away fill'd with the bitterest envy.
waltwhitman,We Two Boys Together Clinging
waltwhitman,"We two boys together clinging,"
waltwhitman,"One the other never leaving,"
waltwhitman,"Up and down the roads going, North and South excursions making,"
waltwhitman,"Power enjoying, elbows stretching, fingers clutching,"
waltwhitman,"Arm'd and fearless, eating, drinking, sleeping, loving."
waltwhitman,"No law less than ourselves owning, sailing, soldiering, thieving,"
waltwhitman,"threatening,"
waltwhitman,"Misers, menials, priests alarming, air breathing, water drinking, on"
waltwhitman,"the turf or the sea-beach dancing,"
waltwhitman,"Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, feebleness chasing,"
waltwhitman,Fulfilling our foray.
waltwhitman,A Promise to California
waltwhitman,"A promise to California,"
waltwhitman,"Or inland to the great pastoral Plains, and on to Puget sound and Oregon;"
waltwhitman,"Sojourning east a while longer, soon I travel toward you, to remain,"
waltwhitman,"to teach robust American love,"
waltwhitman,"For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you,"
waltwhitman,"inland, and along the Western sea;"
waltwhitman,"For these States tend inland and toward the Western sea, and I will also."
waltwhitman,Here the Frailest Leaves of Me
waltwhitman,"Here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting,"
waltwhitman,"Here I shade and hide my thoughts, I myself do not expose them,"
waltwhitman,And yet they expose me more than all my other poems.
waltwhitman,No Labor-Saving Machine
waltwhitman,"No labor-saving machine,"
waltwhitman,"Nor discovery have I made,"
waltwhitman,Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to found
waltwhitman,"hospital or library,"
waltwhitman,"Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for America,"
waltwhitman,"Nor literary success nor intellect; nor book for the book-shelf,"
waltwhitman,"But a few carols vibrating through the air I leave,"
waltwhitman,For comrades and lovers.
waltwhitman,A Glimpse
waltwhitman,"A glimpse through an interstice caught,"
waltwhitman,Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove
waltwhitman,"late of a winter night, and I unremark'd seated in a corner,"
waltwhitman,"Of a youth who loves me and whom I love, silently approaching and"
waltwhitman,"seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand,"
waltwhitman,"A long while amid the noises of coming and going, of drinking and"
waltwhitman,"oath and smutty jest,"
waltwhitman,"There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little,"
waltwhitman,perhaps not a word.
waltwhitman,A Leaf for Hand in Hand
waltwhitman,A leaf for hand in hand;
waltwhitman,You natural persons old and young!
waltwhitman,You on the Mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of
waltwhitman,the Mississippi!
waltwhitman,You friendly boatmen and mechanics! you roughs!
waltwhitman,You twain! and all processions moving along the streets!
waltwhitman,I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it common for you to
waltwhitman,walk hand in hand.
waltwhitman,"Earth, My Likeness"
waltwhitman,"Earth, my likeness,"
waltwhitman,"Though you look so impassive, ample and spheric there,"
waltwhitman,I now suspect that is not all;
waltwhitman,"I now suspect there is something fierce in you eligible to burst forth,"
waltwhitman,"For an athlete is enamour'd of me, and I of him,"
waltwhitman,But toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me eligible
waltwhitman,"to burst forth,"
waltwhitman,"I dare not tell it in words, not even in these songs."
waltwhitman,I Dream'd in a Dream
waltwhitman,I dream'd in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the
waltwhitman,"whole of the rest of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"I dream'd that was the new city of Friends,"
waltwhitman,"Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love, it led the rest,"
waltwhitman,"It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,"
waltwhitman,And in all their looks and words.
waltwhitman,What Think You I Take My Pen in Hand?
waltwhitman,What think you I take my pen in hand to record?
waltwhitman,"The battle-ship, perfect-model'd, majestic, that I saw pass the"
waltwhitman,offing to-day under full sail?
waltwhitman,The splendors of the past day? or the splendor of the night that
waltwhitman,envelops me?
waltwhitman,Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me? --no;
waltwhitman,But merely of two simple men I saw to-day on the pier in the midst
waltwhitman,"of the crowd, parting the parting of dear friends,"
waltwhitman,"The one to remain hung on the other's neck and passionately kiss'd him,"
waltwhitman,While the one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in his arms.
waltwhitman,To the East and to the West
waltwhitman,"To the East and to the West,"
waltwhitman,"To the man of the Seaside State and of Pennsylvania,"
waltwhitman,"To the Kanadian of the north, to the Southerner I love,"
waltwhitman,"These with perfect trust to depict you as myself, the germs are in all men,"
waltwhitman,I believe the main purport of these States is to found a superb
waltwhitman,"friendship, exalte, previously unknown,"
waltwhitman,"Because I perceive it waits, and has been always waiting, latent in all men."
waltwhitman,Sometimes with One I Love
waltwhitman,Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse
waltwhitman,"unreturn'd love,"
waltwhitman,"But now I think there is no unreturn'd love, the pay is certain one"
waltwhitman,"way or another,"
waltwhitman,"(I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return'd,"
waltwhitman,Yet out of that I have written these songs.)
waltwhitman,To a Western Boy
waltwhitman,Many things to absorb I teach to help you become eleve of mine;
waltwhitman,"Yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins,"
waltwhitman,"If you be not silently selected by lovers and do not silently select lovers,"
waltwhitman,Of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine?
waltwhitman,Fast Anchor'd Eternal O Love!
waltwhitman,Fast-anchor'd eternal O love! O woman I love!
waltwhitman,"O bride! O wife! more resistless than I can tell, the thought of you!"
waltwhitman,"Then separate, as disembodied or another born,"
waltwhitman,"Ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation,"
waltwhitman,"I ascend, I float in the regions of your love O man,"
waltwhitman,O sharer of my roving life.
waltwhitman,Among the Multitude
waltwhitman,"Among the men and women the multitude,"
waltwhitman,"I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs,"
waltwhitman,"Acknowledging none else, not parent, wife, husband, brother, child,"
waltwhitman,"any nearer than I am,"
waltwhitman,"Some are baffled, but that one is not--that one knows me."
waltwhitman,"Ah lover and perfect equal,"
waltwhitman,"I meant that you should discover me so by faint indirections,"
waltwhitman,And I when I meet you mean to discover you by the like in you.
waltwhitman,O You Whom I Often and Silently Come
waltwhitman,"O you whom I often and silently come where you are that I may be with you,"
waltwhitman,"As I walk by your side or sit near, or remain in the same room with you,"
waltwhitman,Little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is
waltwhitman,playing within me.
waltwhitman,That Shadow My Likeness
waltwhitman,"That shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a livelihood,"
waltwhitman,"chattering, chaffering,"
waltwhitman,"How often I find myself standing and looking at it where it flits,"
waltwhitman,How often I question and doubt whether that is really me;
waltwhitman,"But among my lovers and caroling these songs,"
waltwhitman,O I never doubt whether that is really me.
waltwhitman,Full of Life Now
waltwhitman,"Full of life now, compact, visible,"
waltwhitman,"I, forty years old the eighty-third year of the States,"
waltwhitman,"To one a century hence or any number of centuries hence,"
waltwhitman,"To you yet unborn these, seeking you."
waltwhitman,"When you read these I that was visible am become invisible,"
waltwhitman,"Now it is you, compact, visible, realizing my poems, seeking me,"
waltwhitman,Fancying how happy you were if I could be with you and become your comrade;
waltwhitman,Be it as if I were with you. (Be not too certain but I am now with you.)

waltwhitman,"yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,"
waltwhitman,"From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces,"
waltwhitman,and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.

waltwhitman,"O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you,"
waltwhitman,"You express me better than I can express myself,"
waltwhitman,You shall be more to me than my poem.
waltwhitman,"I think heroic deeds were all conceiv'd in the open air, and all"
waltwhitman,"free poems also,"
waltwhitman,"I think I could stop here myself and do miracles,"
waltwhitman,"I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and whoever"

waltwhitman,"Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,"
waltwhitman,"Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that"
waltwhitman,would hold me.
waltwhitman,"I inhale great draughts of space,"
waltwhitman,"The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine."
waltwhitman,"I am larger, better than I thought,"
waltwhitman,I did not know I held so much goodness.
waltwhitman,"All seems beautiful to me,"
waltwhitman,can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me
waltwhitman,"I would do the same to you,"
waltwhitman,"I will recruit for myself and you as I go,"
waltwhitman,"I will scatter myself among men and women as I go,"
waltwhitman,"I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,"
waltwhitman,"Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me,"
waltwhitman,Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me.
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,"Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me,"
waltwhitman,Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd it would not
waltwhitman,astonish me.
waltwhitman,"Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,"
waltwhitman,It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.
waltwhitman,"Here a great personal deed has room,"
waltwhitman,"(Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,"
waltwhitman,Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all
waltwhitman,authority and all argument against it.)
waltwhitman,"Here is the test of wisdom,"
waltwhitman,"Wisdom is not finally tested in schools,"
waltwhitman,"Wisdom cannot be pass'd from one having it to another not having it,"
waltwhitman,"Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,"
waltwhitman,"Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,"
waltwhitman,"Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the"
waltwhitman,excellence of things;
waltwhitman,Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes
waltwhitman,it out of the soul.
waltwhitman,"Now I re-examine philosophies and religions,"
waltwhitman,"They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the"
waltwhitman,spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.
waltwhitman,"Here is realization,"
waltwhitman,"Here is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him,"
waltwhitman,"The past, the future, majesty, love--if they are vacant of you, you"
waltwhitman,are vacant of them.
waltwhitman,Only the kernel of every object nourishes;
waltwhitman,Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?
waltwhitman,Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?
waltwhitman,"Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion'd, it is apropos;"
waltwhitman,Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?
waltwhitman,Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,"Here is the efflux of the soul,"
waltwhitman,"The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower'd gates,"
waltwhitman,"ever provoking questions,"
waltwhitman,These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?
waltwhitman,Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight
waltwhitman,expands my blood?
waltwhitman,Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?
waltwhitman,Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious
waltwhitman,thoughts descend upon me?
waltwhitman,(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always
waltwhitman,drop fruit as I pass;)
waltwhitman,What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?
waltwhitman,What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?
waltwhitman,What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by
waltwhitman,and pause?
waltwhitman,What gives me to be free to a woman's and man's good-will? what
waltwhitman,gives them to be free to mine?
waltwhitman,8
waltwhitman,"The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,"
waltwhitman,"I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,"
waltwhitman,"Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged."
waltwhitman,"Here rises the fluid and attaching character,"
waltwhitman,The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of
waltwhitman,"man and woman,"
waltwhitman,(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day
waltwhitman,"out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet"
waltwhitman,continually out of itself.)
waltwhitman,Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the
waltwhitman,"love of young and old,"
waltwhitman,"From it falls distill'd the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,"
waltwhitman,Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.
waltwhitman,9
waltwhitman,Allons! whoever you are come travel with me!
waltwhitman,Traveling with me you find what never tires.
waltwhitman,"The earth never tires,"
waltwhitman,"The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is rude"
waltwhitman,"and incomprehensible at first,"
waltwhitman,"Be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop'd,"
waltwhitman,I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell.
waltwhitman,"Allons! we must not stop here,"
waltwhitman,"However sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this dwelling"
waltwhitman,"we cannot remain here,"
waltwhitman,However shelter'd this port and however calm these waters we must
waltwhitman,"not anchor here,"
waltwhitman,However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted
waltwhitman,to receive it but a little while.
waltwhitman,10
waltwhitman,"Allons! the inducements shall be greater,"
waltwhitman,"We will sail pathless and wild seas,"
waltwhitman,"We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee clipper"
waltwhitman,speeds by under full sail.
waltwhitman,"Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements,"
waltwhitman,"Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity;"
waltwhitman,Allons! from all formules!
waltwhitman,"From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests."
waltwhitman,The stale cadaver blocks up the passage--the burial waits no longer.
waltwhitman,Allons! yet take warning!
waltwhitman,"He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance,"
waltwhitman,"None may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health,"
waltwhitman,"Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself,"
waltwhitman,"Only those may come who come in sweet and determin'd bodies,"
waltwhitman,"No diseas'd person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted here."
waltwhitman,"(I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes,"
waltwhitman,We convince by our presence.)
waltwhitman,11
waltwhitman,"Listen! I will be honest with you,"
waltwhitman,"I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes,"
waltwhitman,These are the days that must happen to you:
waltwhitman,"You shall not heap up what is call'd riches,"
waltwhitman,"You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve,"
waltwhitman,"You but arrive at the city to which you were destin'd, you hardly"
waltwhitman,settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call'd by an
waltwhitman,"irresistible call to depart,"
waltwhitman,You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those
waltwhitman,"who remain behind you,"
waltwhitman,What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with
waltwhitman,"passionate kisses of parting,"
waltwhitman,You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach'd hands
waltwhitman,toward you.
waltwhitman,12
waltwhitman,"Allons! after the great Companions, and to belong to them!"
waltwhitman,They too are on the road--they are the swift and majestic men--they
waltwhitman,"are the greatest women,"
waltwhitman,"Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas,"
waltwhitman,"Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land,"
waltwhitman,"Habitues of many distant countries, habitues of far-distant dwellings,"
waltwhitman,"Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers,"
waltwhitman,"Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore,"
waltwhitman,"Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of"
waltwhitman,"children, bearers of children,"
waltwhitman,"Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers-down of coffins,"
waltwhitman,"Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the curious"
waltwhitman,"years each emerging from that which preceded it,"
waltwhitman,"Journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse phases,"
waltwhitman,"Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days,"
waltwhitman,"Journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their bearded"
waltwhitman,"and well-grain'd manhood,"
waltwhitman,"Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd, content,"
waltwhitman,"Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood,"
waltwhitman,"Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe,"
waltwhitman,"Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death."
waltwhitman,13
waltwhitman,"Allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless,"
waltwhitman,"To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights,"
waltwhitman,"To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights"
waltwhitman,"they tend to,"
waltwhitman,"Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys,"
waltwhitman,"To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it,"
waltwhitman,"To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and pass it,"
waltwhitman,"To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you,"
waltwhitman,"however long but it stretches and waits for you,"
waltwhitman,"To see no being, not God's or any, but you also go thither,"
waltwhitman,"To see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all without"
waltwhitman,"labor or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one"
waltwhitman,"particle of it,"
waltwhitman,To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's elegant
waltwhitman,"villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and"
waltwhitman,"the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens,"
waltwhitman,"To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through,"
waltwhitman,"To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go,"
waltwhitman,To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter
waltwhitman,"them, to gather the love out of their hearts,"
waltwhitman,"To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave"
waltwhitman,"them behind you,"
waltwhitman,"To know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads for"
waltwhitman,traveling souls.
waltwhitman,"All parts away for the progress of souls,"
waltwhitman,"All religion, all solid things, arts, governments--all that was or is"
waltwhitman,"apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and corners"
waltwhitman,before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe.
waltwhitman,Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of
waltwhitman,"the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance."
waltwhitman,"Forever alive, forever forward,"
waltwhitman,"Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble,"
waltwhitman,"dissatisfied,"
waltwhitman,"Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men,"
waltwhitman,"They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not where they go,"
waltwhitman,But I know that they go toward the best--toward something great.
waltwhitman,"Whoever you are, come forth! or man or woman come forth!"
waltwhitman,"You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though"
waltwhitman,"you built it, or though it has been built for you."
waltwhitman,Out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen!
waltwhitman,"It is useless to protest, I know all and expose it."
waltwhitman,"Behold through you as bad as the rest,"
waltwhitman,"Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people,"
waltwhitman,"Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and trimm'd faces,"
waltwhitman,Behold a secret silent loathing and despair.
waltwhitman,"No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession,"
waltwhitman,"Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes,"
waltwhitman,"Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and"
waltwhitman,"bland in the parlors,"
waltwhitman,"In the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly,"
waltwhitman,"Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bedroom,"
waltwhitman,"everywhere,"
waltwhitman,"Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the"
waltwhitman,"breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones,"
waltwhitman,"Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers,"
waltwhitman,"Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself,"
waltwhitman,Speaking of any thing else but never of itself.
waltwhitman,14
waltwhitman,Allons! through struggles and wars!
waltwhitman,The goal that was named cannot be countermanded.
waltwhitman,Have the past struggles succeeded?
waltwhitman,What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? Nature?
waltwhitman,Now understand me well--it is provided in the essence of things that
waltwhitman,"from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth"
waltwhitman,something to make a greater struggle necessary.
waltwhitman,"My call is the call of battle, I nourish active rebellion,"
waltwhitman,"He going with me must go well arm'd,"
waltwhitman,"He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies,"
waltwhitman,desertions.
waltwhitman,15
waltwhitman,Allons! the road is before us!
waltwhitman,It is safe--I have tried it--my own feet have tried it well--be not
waltwhitman,detain'd!
waltwhitman,"Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the"
waltwhitman,shelf unopen'd!
waltwhitman,Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn'd!
waltwhitman,Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher!
waltwhitman,Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the
waltwhitman,"court, and the judge expound the law."
waltwhitman,"Camerado, I give you my hand!"
waltwhitman,"I give you my love more precious than money,"
waltwhitman,I give you myself before preaching or law;
waltwhitman,Will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me?
waltwhitman,Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?
waltwhitman,BOOK VIII
waltwhitman,Crossing Brooklyn Ferry
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face!
waltwhitman,Clouds of the west--sun there half an hour high--I see you also face
waltwhitman,to face.
waltwhitman,"Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious"
waltwhitman,you are to me!
waltwhitman,"On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning"
waltwhitman,"home, are more curious to me than you suppose,"
waltwhitman,And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more
waltwhitman,"to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose."
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,"
waltwhitman,"The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme, myself disintegrated, every"
waltwhitman,"one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,"
waltwhitman,"The similitudes of the past and those of the future,"
waltwhitman,"The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on"
waltwhitman,"the walk in the street and the passage over the river,"
waltwhitman,"The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,"
waltwhitman,"The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,"
waltwhitman,"The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others."
waltwhitman,"Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,"
waltwhitman,"Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,"
waltwhitman,"Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the"
waltwhitman,"heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,"
waltwhitman,Others will see the islands large and small;
waltwhitman,"Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half"
waltwhitman,"an hour high,"
waltwhitman,"A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others"
waltwhitman,"will see them,"
waltwhitman,"Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the"
waltwhitman,falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"It avails not, time nor place--distance avails not,"
waltwhitman,"I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many"
waltwhitman,"generations hence,"
waltwhitman,"Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,"
waltwhitman,"Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,"
waltwhitman,Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the
waltwhitman,"bright flow, I was refresh'd,"
waltwhitman,"Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift"
waltwhitman,"current, I stood yet was hurried,"
waltwhitman,Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the
waltwhitman,"thick-stemm'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd."
waltwhitman,"I too many and many a time cross'd the river of old,"
waltwhitman,"Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air"
waltwhitman,"floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,"
waltwhitman,Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left
waltwhitman,"the rest in strong shadow,"
waltwhitman,"Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south,"
waltwhitman,"Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,"
waltwhitman,"Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,"
waltwhitman,Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my
waltwhitman,"head in the sunlit water,"
waltwhitman,"Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward,"
waltwhitman,"Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,"
waltwhitman,"Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,"
waltwhitman,"Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,"
waltwhitman,"Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,"
waltwhitman,"The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,"
waltwhitman,"The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender"
waltwhitman,"serpentine pennants,"
waltwhitman,"The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilothouses,"
waltwhitman,"The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,"
waltwhitman,"The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,"
waltwhitman,"The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the"
waltwhitman,"frolic-some crests and glistening,"
waltwhitman,"The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the"
waltwhitman,"granite storehouses by the docks,"
waltwhitman,"On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on"
waltwhitman,"each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,"
waltwhitman,On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning
waltwhitman,"high and glaringly into the night,"
waltwhitman,Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow
waltwhitman,"light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets."
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,"
waltwhitman,"I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,"
waltwhitman,"The men and women I saw were all near to me,"
waltwhitman,Others the same--others who look back on me because I look'd forward
waltwhitman,"to them,"
waltwhitman,"(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)"
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,What is it then between us?
waltwhitman,What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?
waltwhitman,"Whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not,"
waltwhitman,"I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,"
waltwhitman,"I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the"
waltwhitman,"waters around it,"
waltwhitman,"I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,"
waltwhitman,"In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,"
waltwhitman,"In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,"
waltwhitman,"I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,"
waltwhitman,"I too had receiv'd identity by my body,"
waltwhitman,"That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I"
waltwhitman,should be of my body.
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,"It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,"
waltwhitman,"The dark threw its patches down upon me also,"
waltwhitman,"The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,"
waltwhitman,"My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?"
waltwhitman,"Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,"
waltwhitman,"I am he who knew what it was to be evil,"
waltwhitman,"I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,"
waltwhitman,"Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,"
waltwhitman,"Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,"
waltwhitman,"Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,"
waltwhitman,"The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me."
waltwhitman,"The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,"
waltwhitman,"Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting,"
waltwhitman,"Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,"
waltwhitman,Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as
waltwhitman,"they saw me approaching or passing,"
waltwhitman,"Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of"
waltwhitman,"their flesh against me as I sat,"
waltwhitman,"Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet"
waltwhitman,"never told them a word,"
waltwhitman,"Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,"
waltwhitman,"Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,"
waltwhitman,"The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,"
waltwhitman,"Or as small as we like, or both great and small."
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,"Closer yet I approach you,"
waltwhitman,"What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you--I laid in my"
waltwhitman,"stores in advance,"
waltwhitman,I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.
waltwhitman,Who was to know what should come home to me?
waltwhitman,Who knows but I am enjoying this?
waltwhitman,"Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you"
waltwhitman,"now, for all you cannot see me?"
waltwhitman,8
waltwhitman,"Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than"
waltwhitman,mast-hemm'd Manhattan?
waltwhitman,River and sunset and scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide?
waltwhitman,"The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the"
waltwhitman,"twilight, and the belated lighter?"
waltwhitman,"What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I"
waltwhitman,love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach?
waltwhitman,What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that
waltwhitman,looks in my face?
waltwhitman,"Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?"
waltwhitman,We understand then do we not?
waltwhitman,"What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?"
waltwhitman,What the study could not teach--what the preaching could not
waltwhitman,"accomplish is accomplish'd, is it not?"
waltwhitman,9
waltwhitman,"Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!"
waltwhitman,"Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd waves!"
waltwhitman,"Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the"
waltwhitman,men and women generations after me!
waltwhitman,"Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!"
waltwhitman,"Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!"
waltwhitman,"Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!"
waltwhitman,"Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!"
waltwhitman,"Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!"
waltwhitman,"Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my"
waltwhitman,nighest name!
waltwhitman,"Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!"
waltwhitman,"Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one"
waltwhitman,makes it!
waltwhitman,"Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be"
waltwhitman,looking upon you;
waltwhitman,"Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet"
waltwhitman,haste with the hasting current;
waltwhitman,"Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;"
waltwhitman,"Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all"
waltwhitman,downcast eyes have time to take it from you!
waltwhitman,"Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any"
waltwhitman,"one's head, in the sunlit water!"
waltwhitman,"Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail'd"
waltwhitman,"schooners, sloops, lighters!"
waltwhitman,"Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset!"
waltwhitman,"Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at"
waltwhitman,nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!
waltwhitman,"Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,"
waltwhitman,"You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,"
waltwhitman,"About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas,"
waltwhitman,"Thrive, cities--bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and"
waltwhitman,"sufficient rivers,"
waltwhitman,"Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,"
waltwhitman,"Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting."
waltwhitman,"You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,"
waltwhitman,"We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward,"
waltwhitman,"Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us,"
waltwhitman,"We use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently within us,"
waltwhitman,"We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also,"
waltwhitman,"You furnish your parts toward eternity,"
waltwhitman,"Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul."

waltwhitman,Song of the Answerer
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Now list to my morning's romanza, I tell the signs of the Answerer,"
waltwhitman,To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine before me.
waltwhitman,"A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother,"
waltwhitman,How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother?
waltwhitman,Tell him to send me the signs. And I stand before the young man
waltwhitman,"face to face, and take his right hand in my left hand and his"
waltwhitman,"left hand in my right hand,"
waltwhitman,"And I answer for his brother and for men, and I answer for him that"
waltwhitman,"answers for all, and send these signs."
waltwhitman,"Him all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive and final,"
waltwhitman,"Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves as amid light,"
waltwhitman,Him they immerse and he immerses them.
waltwhitman,"Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape,"
waltwhitman,"people, animals,"
waltwhitman,"The profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean, (so"
waltwhitman,"tell I my morning's romanza,)"
waltwhitman,"All enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money will buy,"
waltwhitman,"The best farms, others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps,"
waltwhitman,"The noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building and he"
waltwhitman,"domiciles there,"
waltwhitman,"Nothing for any one but what is for him, near and far are for him,"
waltwhitman,"the ships in the offing,"
waltwhitman,The perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody.
waltwhitman,"He puts things in their attitudes,"
waltwhitman,"He puts to-day out of himself with plasticity and love,"
waltwhitman,"He places his own times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and"
waltwhitman,"sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest"
waltwhitman,"never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them."
waltwhitman,"He is the Answerer,"
waltwhitman,"What can be answer'd he answers, and what cannot be answer'd he"
waltwhitman,shows how it cannot be answer'd.
waltwhitman,"A man is a summons and challenge,"
waltwhitman,(It is vain to skulk--do you hear that mocking and laughter? do you
waltwhitman,hear the ironical echoes?)
waltwhitman,"Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride,"
waltwhitman,"beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction,"
waltwhitman,"He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and"
waltwhitman,down also.
waltwhitman,"Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly"
waltwhitman,"and gently and safely by day or by night,"
waltwhitman,"He has the pass-key of hearts, to him the response of the prying of"
waltwhitman,hands on the knobs.
waltwhitman,"His welcome is universal, the flow of beauty is not more welcome or"
waltwhitman,"universal than he is,"
waltwhitman,The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.
waltwhitman,"Every existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue,"
waltwhitman,"He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and"
waltwhitman,"any man translates, and any man translates himself also,"
waltwhitman,"One part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner, he sees"
waltwhitman,how they join.
waltwhitman,He says indifferently and alike How are you friend? to the President
waltwhitman,"at his levee,"
waltwhitman,"And he says Good-day my brother, to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-field,"
waltwhitman,And both understand him and know that his speech is right.
waltwhitman,"He walks with perfect ease in the capitol,"
waltwhitman,"He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another,"
waltwhitman,Here is our equal appearing and new.
waltwhitman,"Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,"
waltwhitman,"And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that"
waltwhitman,"he has follow'd the sea,"
waltwhitman,"And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,"
waltwhitman,"And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them,"
waltwhitman,"No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or has"
waltwhitman,"follow'd it,"
waltwhitman,"No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and"
waltwhitman,sisters there.
waltwhitman,"The English believe he comes of their English stock,"
waltwhitman,"A Jew to the Jew he seems, a Russ to the Russ, usual and near,"
waltwhitman,removed from none.
waltwhitman,"Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-house claims him,"
waltwhitman,"The Italian or Frenchman is sure, the German is sure, the Spaniard"
waltwhitman,"is sure, and the island Cuban is sure,"
waltwhitman,"The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the Mississippi"
waltwhitman,"or St. Lawrence or Sacramento, or Hudson or Paumanok sound, claims him."
waltwhitman,"The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,"
waltwhitman,"The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see"
waltwhitman,"themselves in the ways of him, he strangely transmutes them,"
waltwhitman,"They are not vile any more, they hardly know themselves they are so grown."
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"The indications and tally of time,"
waltwhitman,"Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs,"
waltwhitman,"Time, always without break, indicates itself in parts,"
waltwhitman,What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company
waltwhitman,"of singers, and their words,"
waltwhitman,"The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark,"
waltwhitman,"but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark,"
waltwhitman,"The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,"
waltwhitman,"His insight and power encircle things and the human race,"
waltwhitman,He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race.
waltwhitman,"The singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,"
waltwhitman,"The singers are welcom'd, understood, appear often enough, but rare"
waltwhitman,"has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker"
waltwhitman,"of poems, the Answerer,"
waltwhitman,(Not every century nor every five centuries has contain'd such a
waltwhitman,"day, for all its names.)"
waltwhitman,The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible
waltwhitman,"names, but the name of each of them is one of the singers,"
waltwhitman,"The name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,"
waltwhitman,"sweet-singer, night-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer,"
waltwhitman,"weird-singer, or something else."
waltwhitman,"All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,"
waltwhitman,"The words of true poems do not merely please,"
waltwhitman,The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty;
waltwhitman,The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers
waltwhitman,"and fathers,"
waltwhitman,The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science.
waltwhitman,"Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health,"
waltwhitman,"rudeness of body, withdrawnness,"
waltwhitman,"Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such are some of the words of poems."
waltwhitman,"The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer,"
waltwhitman,"The builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist, all"
waltwhitman,"these underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer."
waltwhitman,"The words of the true poems give you more than poems,"
waltwhitman,"They give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war,"
waltwhitman,"peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily life, and every thing else,"
waltwhitman,"They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,"
waltwhitman,"They do not seek beauty, they are sought,"
waltwhitman,"Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing,"
waltwhitman,"fain, love-sick."
waltwhitman,"They prepare for death, yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,"
waltwhitman,"They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,"
waltwhitman,"Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars, to"
waltwhitman,"learn one of the meanings,"
waltwhitman,"To launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless"
waltwhitman,rings and never be quiet again.

waltwhitman,O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I row
waltwhitman,"just before sunrise toward the buoys,"
waltwhitman,"I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are"
waltwhitman,"desperate with their claws as I take them out, I insert"

waltwhitman,(O something pernicious and dread!
waltwhitman,Something far away from a puny and pious life!
waltwhitman,Something unproved! something in a trance!
waltwhitman,Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)
waltwhitman,"O to work in mines, or forging iron,"

waltwhitman,To taste the savage taste of blood--to be so devilish!
waltwhitman,To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.
waltwhitman,O the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my old cruise again!
waltwhitman,"I feel the ship's motion under me, I feel the Atlantic breezes fanning me,"
waltwhitman,"I hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head, There--she blows!"
waltwhitman,"Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest--we descend,"
waltwhitman,"wild with excitement,"
waltwhitman,"I leap in the lower'd boat, we row toward our prey where he lies,"
waltwhitman,"We approach stealthy and silent, I see the mountainous mass,"
waltwhitman,"lethargic, basking,"
waltwhitman,"I see the harpooneer standing up, I see the weapon dart from his"
waltwhitman,vigorous arm;
waltwhitman,"O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale, settling,"
waltwhitman,"running to windward, tows me,"
waltwhitman,"Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close again,"
waltwhitman,"I see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd in the wound,"
waltwhitman,"Again we back off, I see him settle again, the life is leaving him fast,"
waltwhitman,"As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim in circles narrower and"
waltwhitman,"narrower, swiftly cutting the water--I see him die,"
waltwhitman,"He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then"
waltwhitman,falls flat and still in the bloody foam.
waltwhitman,"O the old manhood of me, my noblest joy of all!"
waltwhitman,"My children and grand-children, my white hair and beard,"
waltwhitman,"My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life."
waltwhitman,O ripen'd joy of womanhood! O happiness at last!
waltwhitman,"I am more than eighty years of age, I am the most venerable mother,"
waltwhitman,How clear is my mind--how all people draw nigh to me!
waltwhitman,What attractions are these beyond any before? what bloom more
waltwhitman,than the bloom of youth?
waltwhitman,What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me?
waltwhitman,O the orator's joys!
waltwhitman,"To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from the"
waltwhitman,"ribs and throat,"
waltwhitman,"To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,"
waltwhitman,To lead America--to quell America with a great tongue.
waltwhitman,"O the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself, receiving identity through"
waltwhitman,"materials and loving them, observing characters and absorbing them,"
waltwhitman,"My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing, touch,"
waltwhitman,"reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like,"
waltwhitman,"The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh,"
waltwhitman,"My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,"
waltwhitman,Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes
waltwhitman,"which finally see,"
waltwhitman,"Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts,"
waltwhitman,"embraces, procreates."
waltwhitman,O the farmer's joys!
waltwhitman,"Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's,"
waltwhitman,"Kansian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys!"
waltwhitman,"To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work,"
waltwhitman,"To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops,"
waltwhitman,"To plough land in the spring for maize,"
waltwhitman,"To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in the fall."
waltwhitman,"O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore,"

waltwhitman,"To meet life as a powerful conqueror,"
waltwhitman,"No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,"
waltwhitman,"To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground, proving"
waltwhitman,"my interior soul impregnable,"
waltwhitman,And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.
waltwhitman,"For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating--the joy of death!"
waltwhitman,"The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments,"
waltwhitman,"for reasons,"
waltwhitman,"Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd, or render'd"

waltwhitman,O to attract by more than attraction!
waltwhitman,How it is I know not--yet behold! the something which obeys none
waltwhitman,"of the rest,"
waltwhitman,"It is offensive, never defensive--yet how magnetic it draws."

waltwhitman,"houses,"
waltwhitman,"To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,"
waltwhitman,To sail and sail and sail!
waltwhitman,O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys!
waltwhitman,"To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on!"
waltwhitman,"To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports,"
waltwhitman,"A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)"

waltwhitman,"What invigorates life invigorates death,"
waltwhitman,"And the dead advance as much as the living advance,"
waltwhitman,"And the future is no more uncertain than the present,"
waltwhitman,For the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as much as the
waltwhitman,"delicatesse of the earth and of man,"
waltwhitman,And nothing endures but personal qualities.
waltwhitman,What do you think endures?
waltwhitman,Do you think a great city endures?
waltwhitman,Or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution? or the

waltwhitman,How beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed!
waltwhitman,How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a
waltwhitman,man's or woman's look!
waltwhitman,All waits or goes by default till a strong being appears;
waltwhitman,"A strong being is the proof of the race and of the ability of the universe,"
waltwhitman,"When he or she appears materials are overaw'd,"
waltwhitman,"The dispute on the soul stops,"
waltwhitman,"The old customs and phrases are confronted, turn'd back, or laid away."
waltwhitman,What is your money-making now? what can it do now?
waltwhitman,What is your respectability now?

waltwhitman,"Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths, served the pastoral"
waltwhitman,"tribes and nomads,"
waltwhitman,"Served the long distant Kelt, served the hardy pirates of the Baltic,"
waltwhitman,"Served before any of those the venerable and harmless men of Ethiopia,"
waltwhitman,Served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure and the
waltwhitman,"making of those for war,"

waltwhitman,"They spirt no more the blood of European nobles, they clasp no more"
waltwhitman,the necks of queens.
waltwhitman,"I see the headsman withdraw and become useless,"

waltwhitman,"The same undying soul of earth's, activity's, beauty's, heroism's"
waltwhitman,"expression,"
waltwhitman,"Out from her evolutions hither come, ended the strata of her former themes,"
waltwhitman,"Hidden and cover'd by to-day's, foundation of to-day's,"
waltwhitman,"Ended, deceas'd through time, her voice by Castaly's fountain,"
waltwhitman,"Silent the broken-lipp'd Sphynx in Egypt, silent all those century-"
waltwhitman,"baffling tombs,"
waltwhitman,"Ended for aye the epics of Asia's, Europe's helmeted warriors, ended"
waltwhitman,"the primitive call of the muses,"
waltwhitman,"Calliope's call forever closed, Clio, Melpomene, Thalia dead,"
waltwhitman,"Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana, ended the quest of the"
waltwhitman,"holy Graal,"
waltwhitman,"Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind, extinct,"
waltwhitman,"The Crusaders' streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the sunrise,"
waltwhitman,"Amadis, Tancred, utterly gone, Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver gone,"
waltwhitman,"Palmerin, ogre, departed, vanish'd the turrets that Usk from its"
waltwhitman,"waters reflected,"
waltwhitman,"Arthur vanish'd with all his knights, Merlin and Lancelot and"
waltwhitman,"Galahad, all gone, dissolv'd utterly like an exhalation;"
waltwhitman,"Pass'd! pass'd! for us, forever pass'd, that once so mighty world,"
waltwhitman,"now void, inanimate, phantom world,"
waltwhitman,"Embroider'd, dazzling, foreign world, with all its gorgeous legends, myths,"
waltwhitman,"Its kings and castles proud, its priests and warlike lords and"
waltwhitman,"courtly dames,"
waltwhitman,"Pass'd to its charnel vault, coffin'd with crown and armor on,"
waltwhitman,"Blazon'd with Shakspere's purple page,"
waltwhitman,And dirged by Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme.
waltwhitman,"I say I see, my friends, if you do not, the illustrious emigre, (having it"
waltwhitman,"is true in her day, although the same, changed, journey'd considerable,)"
waltwhitman,"Making directly for this rendezvous, vigorously clearing a path for"
waltwhitman,"herself, striding through the confusion,"
waltwhitman,"By thud of machinery and shrill steam-whistle undismay'd,"
waltwhitman,"Bluff'd not a bit by drain-pipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers,"
waltwhitman,"Smiling and pleas'd with palpable intent to stay,"
waltwhitman,"She's here, install'd amid the kitchen ware!"

waltwhitman,But hold--don't I forget my manners?
waltwhitman,"To introduce the stranger, (what else indeed do I live to chant"

waltwhitman,"Thy great cathedral sacred industry, no tomb,"
waltwhitman,A keep for life for practical invention.
waltwhitman,"As in a waking vision,"

waltwhitman,Its manifold ensemble.

waltwhitman,"on till they become bullion,"
waltwhitman,"You shall watch how the printer sets type, and learn what a"

waltwhitman,Away with themes of war! away with war itself!

waltwhitman,"blacken'd, mutilated corpses!"
waltwhitman,"That hell unpent and raid of blood, fit for wild tigers or for"

waltwhitman,"With thy undaunted armies, engineering,"
waltwhitman,"Thy pennants labor, loosen'd to the breeze,"
waltwhitman,Thy bugles sounding loud and clear.
waltwhitman,Away with old romance!
waltwhitman,"Away with novels, plots and plays of foreign courts,"
waltwhitman,"Away with love-verses sugar'd in rhyme, the intrigues, amours of idlers,"
waltwhitman,"Fitted for only banquets of the night where dancers to late music slide,"

waltwhitman,"To work as tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, porter,"
waltwhitman,"To invent a little, something ingenious, to aid the washing, cooking,"

waltwhitman,"I say I bring thee Muse to-day and here,"
waltwhitman,"All occupations, duties broad and close,"
waltwhitman,"Toil, healthy toil and sweat, endless, without cessation,"
waltwhitman,"The old, old practical burdens, interests, joys,"
waltwhitman,"The family, parentage, childhood, husband and wife,"
waltwhitman,"The house-comforts, the house itself and all its belongings,"

waltwhitman,One common indivisible destiny for All.
waltwhitman,"And by the spells which ye vouchsafe to those your ministers in earnest,"
waltwhitman,"I here personify and call my themes, to make them pass before ye."
waltwhitman,"Behold, America! (and thou, ineffable guest and sister!)"
waltwhitman,For thee come trooping up thy waters and thy lands;
waltwhitman,"Behold! thy fields and farms, thy far-off woods and mountains,"
waltwhitman,As in procession coming.
waltwhitman,"Behold, the sea itself,"
waltwhitman,"And on its limitless, heaving breast, the ships;"
waltwhitman,"See, where their white sails, bellying in the wind, speckle the"
waltwhitman,"green and blue,"
waltwhitman,"See, the steamers coming and going, steaming in or out of port,"
waltwhitman,"See, dusky and undulating, the long pennants of smoke."
waltwhitman,"Behold, in Oregon, far in the north and west,"
waltwhitman,"Or in Maine, far in the north and east, thy cheerful axemen,"
waltwhitman,Wielding all day their axes.
waltwhitman,"Behold, on the lakes, thy pilots at their wheels, thy oarsmen,"
waltwhitman,How the ash writhes under those muscular arms!
waltwhitman,"There by the furnace, and there by the anvil,"
waltwhitman,"Behold thy sturdy blacksmiths swinging their sledges,"
waltwhitman,"Overhand so steady, overhand they turn and fall with joyous clank,"
waltwhitman,Like a tumult of laughter.
waltwhitman,"Mark the spirit of invention everywhere, thy rapid patents,"
waltwhitman,"Thy continual workshops, foundries, risen or rising,"
waltwhitman,"See, from their chimneys how the tall flame-fires stream."
waltwhitman,"Mark, thy interminable farms, North, South,"
waltwhitman,"Thy wealthy daughter-states, Eastern and Western,"
waltwhitman,"The varied products of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Georgia, Texas,"
waltwhitman,"and the rest,"
waltwhitman,"Thy limitless crops, grass, wheat, sugar, oil, corn, rice, hemp, hops,"
waltwhitman,"Thy barns all fill'd, the endless freight-train and the bulging store-house,"
waltwhitman,"The grapes that ripen on thy vines, the apples in thy orchards,"
waltwhitman,"Thy incalculable lumber, beef, pork, potatoes, thy coal, thy gold"
waltwhitman,"and silver,"
waltwhitman,The inexhaustible iron in thy mines.
waltwhitman,All thine O sacred Union!

waltwhitman,"City and State, North, South, item and aggregate,"
waltwhitman,"We dedicate, dread Mother, all to thee!"
waltwhitman,"Protectress absolute, thou! bulwark of all!"
waltwhitman,"For well we know that while thou givest each and all, (generous as God,)"
waltwhitman,"Without thee neither all nor each, nor land, home,"
waltwhitman,"Nor ship, nor mine, nor any here this day secure,"
waltwhitman,"Nor aught, nor any day secure."
waltwhitman,9
waltwhitman,"And thou, the Emblem waving over all!"
waltwhitman,"Delicate beauty, a word to thee, (it may be salutary,)"
waltwhitman,Remember thou hast not always been as here to-day so comfortably
waltwhitman,"ensovereign'd,"
waltwhitman,"In other scenes than these have I observ'd thee flag,"
waltwhitman,Not quite so trim and whole and freshly blooming in folds of
waltwhitman,"stainless silk,"
waltwhitman,"But I have seen thee bunting, to tatters torn upon thy splinter'd staff,"
waltwhitman,"Or clutch'd to some young color-bearer's breast with desperate hands,"
waltwhitman,"Savagely struggled for, for life or death, fought over long,"
waltwhitman,"'Mid cannons' thunder-crash and many a curse and groan and yell, and"
waltwhitman,"rifle-volleys cracking sharp,"
waltwhitman,"And moving masses as wild demons surging, and lives as nothing risk'd,"
waltwhitman,"For thy mere remnant grimed with dirt and smoke and sopp'd in blood,"
waltwhitman,"For sake of that, my beauty, and that thou might'st dally as now"
waltwhitman,"secure up there,"
waltwhitman,Many a good man have I seen go under.
waltwhitman,"Now here and these and hence in peace, all thine O Flag!"
waltwhitman,"And here and hence for thee, O universal Muse! and thou for them!"
waltwhitman,"And here and hence O Union, all the work and workmen thine!"
waltwhitman,"None separate from thee--henceforth One only, we and thou,"
waltwhitman,"(For the blood of the children, what is it, only the blood maternal?"
waltwhitman,"And lives and works, what are they all at last, except the roads to"
waltwhitman,faith and death?)
waltwhitman,"While we rehearse our measureless wealth, it is for thee, dear Mother,"
waltwhitman,We own it all and several to-day indissoluble in thee;
waltwhitman,"Think not our chant, our show, merely for products gross or lucre--"
waltwhitman,"it is for thee, the soul in thee, electric, spiritual!"
waltwhitman,"Our farms, inventions, crops, we own in thee! cities and States in thee!"
waltwhitman,Our freedom all in thee! our very lives in thee!
waltwhitman,BOOK XIV
waltwhitman,Song of the Redwood-Tree
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"A California song,"
waltwhitman,"A prophecy and indirection, a thought impalpable to breathe as air,"
waltwhitman,"A chorus of dryads, fading, departing, or hamadryads departing,"
waltwhitman,"A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,"
waltwhitman,Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.
waltwhitman,"Farewell my brethren,"
waltwhitman,"Farewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters,"
waltwhitman,"My time has ended, my term has come."
waltwhitman,"Along the northern coast,"
waltwhitman,"Just back from the rock-bound shore and the caves,"
waltwhitman,"In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country,"
waltwhitman,"With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse,"
waltwhitman,"With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong arms,"
waltwhitman,"Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes, there in the redwood"
waltwhitman,"forest dense,"
waltwhitman,I heard the might tree its death-chant chanting.
waltwhitman,"The choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not,"
waltwhitman,"The quick-ear'd teamsters and chain and jack-screw men heard not,"
waltwhitman,As the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to
waltwhitman,"join the refrain,"
waltwhitman,But in my soul I plainly heard.
waltwhitman,"Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,"
waltwhitman,"Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,"
waltwhitman,"Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its foot-thick bark,"
waltwhitman,"That chant of the seasons and time, chant not of the past only but"
waltwhitman,the future.
waltwhitman,"You untold life of me,"
waltwhitman,"And all you venerable and innocent joys,"
waltwhitman,"Perennial hardy life of me with joys 'mid rain and many a summer sun,"
waltwhitman,And the white snows and night and the wild winds;
waltwhitman,"O the great patient rugged joys, my soul's strong joys unreck'd by man,"
waltwhitman,"(For know I bear the soul befitting me, I too have consciousness, identity,"
waltwhitman,"And all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth,)"
waltwhitman,"Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine,"
waltwhitman,"Our time, our term has come."
waltwhitman,"Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers,"
waltwhitman,"We who have grandly fill'd our time,"
waltwhitman,"With Nature's calm content, with tacit huge delight,"
waltwhitman,"We welcome what we wrought for through the past,"
waltwhitman,And leave the field for them.
waltwhitman,"For them predicted long,"
waltwhitman,"For a superber race, they too to grandly fill their time,"
waltwhitman,"For them we abdicate, in them ourselves ye forest kings.'"
waltwhitman,"In them these skies and airs, these mountain peaks, Shasta, Nevadas,"
waltwhitman,"These huge precipitous cliffs, this amplitude, these valleys, far Yosemite,"
waltwhitman,"To be in them absorb'd, assimilated."
waltwhitman,"Then to a loftier strain,"
waltwhitman,"Still prouder, more ecstatic rose the chant,"
waltwhitman,"As if the heirs, the deities of the West,"
waltwhitman,Joining with master-tongue bore part.
waltwhitman,"Not wan from Asia's fetiches,"
waltwhitman,"Nor red from Europe's old dynastic slaughter-house,"
waltwhitman,"(Area of murder-plots of thrones, with scent left yet of wars and"
waltwhitman,"scaffolds everywhere,"
waltwhitman,"But come from Nature's long and harmless throes, peacefully builded thence,"
waltwhitman,"These virgin lands, lands of the Western shore,"
waltwhitman,"To the new culminating man, to you, the empire new,"
waltwhitman,"You promis'd long, we pledge, we dedicate."
waltwhitman,"You occult deep volitions,"
waltwhitman,"You average spiritual manhood, purpose of all, pois'd on yourself,"
waltwhitman,"giving not taking law,"
waltwhitman,"You womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence life and"
waltwhitman,"love and aught that comes from life and love,"
waltwhitman,"You unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of America, age"
waltwhitman,"upon age working in death the same as life,)"
waltwhitman,"You that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and mould"
waltwhitman,"the New World, adjusting it to Time and Space,"
waltwhitman,"You hidden national will lying in your abysms, conceal'd but ever alert,"
waltwhitman,"You past and present purposes tenaciously pursued, may-be"
waltwhitman,"unconscious of yourselves,"
waltwhitman,"Unswerv'd by all the passing errors, perturbations of the surface;"
waltwhitman,"You vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds, arts,"
waltwhitman,"statutes, literatures,"
waltwhitman,"Here build your homes for good, establish here, these areas entire,"
waltwhitman,"lands of the Western shore,"
waltwhitman,"We pledge, we dedicate to you."
waltwhitman,"For man of you, your characteristic race,"
waltwhitman,"Here may he hardy, sweet, gigantic grow, here tower proportionate to Nature,"
waltwhitman,"Here climb the vast pure spaces unconfined, uncheck'd by wall or roof,"
waltwhitman,"Here laugh with storm or sun, here joy, here patiently inure,"
waltwhitman,"Here heed himself, unfold himself, (not others' formulas heed,)"
waltwhitman,"here fill his time,"
waltwhitman,"To duly fall, to aid, unreck'd at last,"
waltwhitman,"To disappear, to serve."
waltwhitman,"Thus on the northern coast,"
waltwhitman,"In the echo of teamsters' calls and the clinking chains, and the"
waltwhitman,"music of choppers' axes,"
waltwhitman,"The falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek, the groan,"
waltwhitman,"Such words combined from the redwood-tree, as of voices ecstatic,"
waltwhitman,"ancient and rustling,"
waltwhitman,"The century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,"
waltwhitman,"All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,"
waltwhitman,"From the Cascade range to the Wahsatch, or Idaho far, or Utah,"
waltwhitman,"To the deities of the modern henceforth yielding,"
waltwhitman,"The chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity, the"
waltwhitman,"settlements, features all,"
waltwhitman,In the Mendocino woods I caught.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"The flashing and golden pageant of California,"
waltwhitman,"The sudden and gorgeous drama, the sunny and ample lands,"
waltwhitman,"The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado south,"
waltwhitman,"Lands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air, valleys and mountain cliffs,"
waltwhitman,"The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow, the silent, cyclic chemistry,"
waltwhitman,"The slow and steady ages plodding, the unoccupied surface ripening,"
waltwhitman,the rich ores forming beneath;
waltwhitman,"At last the New arriving, assuming, taking possession,"
waltwhitman,"A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere,"
waltwhitman,"Ships coming in from the whole round world, and going out to the"
waltwhitman,"whole world,"
waltwhitman,To India and China and Australia and the thousand island paradises
waltwhitman,"of the Pacific,"
waltwhitman,"Populous cities, the latest inventions, the steamers on the rivers,"
waltwhitman,"the railroads, with many a thrifty farm, with machinery,"
waltwhitman,"And wool and wheat and the grape, and diggings of yellow gold."
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"But more in you than these, lands of the Western shore,"
waltwhitman,"(These but the means, the implements, the standing-ground,)"
waltwhitman,"I see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of years,"
waltwhitman,"till now deferr'd,"
waltwhitman,"Promis'd to be fulfill'd, our common kind, the race."
waltwhitman,"The new society at last, proportionate to Nature,"
waltwhitman,"In man of you, more than your mountain peaks or stalwart trees imperial,"
waltwhitman,"In woman more, far more, than all your gold or vines, or even vital air."
waltwhitman,"Fresh come, to a new world indeed, yet long prepared,"
waltwhitman,"I see the genius of the modern, child of the real and ideal,"
waltwhitman,"Clearing the ground for broad humanity, the true America, heir of"
waltwhitman,"the past so grand,"

waltwhitman,A Song for Occupations
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,A song for occupations!
waltwhitman,In the labor of engines and trades and the labor of fields I find
waltwhitman,"the developments,"
waltwhitman,And find the eternal meanings.
waltwhitman,Workmen and Workwomen!
waltwhitman,Were all educations practical and ornamental well display'd out of
waltwhitman,"me, what would it amount to?"
waltwhitman,"Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise statesman,"
waltwhitman,what would it amount to?
waltwhitman,"Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you, would that satisfy you?"
waltwhitman,"The learn'd, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms,"
waltwhitman,A man like me and never the usual terms.
waltwhitman,"Neither a servant nor a master I,"
waltwhitman,"I take no sooner a large price than a small price, I will have my"
waltwhitman,"own whoever enjoys me,"
waltwhitman,I will be even with you and you shall be even with me.
waltwhitman,If you stand at work in a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest in the
waltwhitman,"same shop,"
waltwhitman,If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend I demand as
waltwhitman,"good as your brother or dearest friend,"
waltwhitman,"If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, I must be"
waltwhitman,"personally as welcome,"
waltwhitman,"If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so for your sake,"
waltwhitman,"If you remember your foolish and outlaw'd deeds, do you think I"
waltwhitman,cannot remember my own foolish and outlaw'd deeds?
waltwhitman,"If you carouse at the table I carouse at the opposite side of the table,"
waltwhitman,"If you meet some stranger in the streets and love him or her, why"
waltwhitman,I often meet strangers in the street and love them.
waltwhitman,Why what have you thought of yourself?
waltwhitman,Is it you then that thought yourself less?
waltwhitman,Is it you that thought the President greater than you?
waltwhitman,Or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than you?
waltwhitman,"(Because you are greasy or pimpled, or were once drunk, or a thief,"
waltwhitman,"Or that you are diseas'd, or rheumatic, or a prostitute,"
waltwhitman,"Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar and never"
waltwhitman,"saw your name in print,"
waltwhitman,Do you give in that you are any less immortal?)
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Souls of men and women! it is not you I call unseen, unheard,"
waltwhitman,"untouchable and untouching,"
waltwhitman,"It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to settle whether"
waltwhitman,"you are alive or no,"
waltwhitman,"I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns."
waltwhitman,"Grown, half-grown and babe, of this country and every country,"
waltwhitman,"in-doors and out-doors, one just as much as the other, I see,"
waltwhitman,And all else behind or through them.
waltwhitman,"The wife, and she is not one jot less than the husband,"
waltwhitman,"The daughter, and she is just as good as the son,"
waltwhitman,"The mother, and she is every bit as much as the father."
waltwhitman,"Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,"
waltwhitman,"Young fellows working on farms and old fellows working on farms,"
waltwhitman,"Sailor-men, merchant-men, coasters, immigrants,"
waltwhitman,"All these I see, but nigher and farther the same I see,"
waltwhitman,None shall escape me and none shall wish to escape me.
waltwhitman,"I bring what you much need yet always have,"
waltwhitman,"Not money, amours, dress, eating, erudition, but as good,"
waltwhitman,"I send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value, but"
waltwhitman,offer the value itself.
waltwhitman,"There is something that comes to one now and perpetually,"
waltwhitman,"It is not what is printed, preach'd, discussed, it eludes discussion"
waltwhitman,"and print,"
waltwhitman,"It is not to be put in a book, it is not in this book,"

waltwhitman,"hearing and sight are from you,"
waltwhitman,"It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest, it is ever provoked by them."
waltwhitman,"You may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it,"
waltwhitman,"You may read the President's message and read nothing about it there,"
waltwhitman,Nothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury
waltwhitman,"department, or in the daily papers or weekly papers,"
waltwhitman,"Or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts"
waltwhitman,of stock.

waltwhitman,"The sun and stars that float in the open air,"
waltwhitman,"The apple-shaped earth and we upon it, surely the drift of them is"
waltwhitman,"something grand,"
waltwhitman,"I do not know what it is except that it is grand, and that it is happiness,"
waltwhitman,And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation or
waltwhitman,"bon-mot or reconnoissance,"
waltwhitman,"And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us,"
waltwhitman,"and without luck must be a failure for us,"
waltwhitman,And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain contingency.
waltwhitman,"The light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the"
waltwhitman,"greed that with perfect complaisance devours all things,"
waltwhitman,"The endless pride and outstretching of man, unspeakable joys and sorrows,"
waltwhitman,"The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and the wonders"
waltwhitman,"that fill each minute of time forever,"
waltwhitman,"What have you reckon'd them for, camerado?"
waltwhitman,Have you reckon'd them for your trade or farm-work? or for the
waltwhitman,profits of your store?
waltwhitman,"Or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman's leisure,"
waltwhitman,or a lady's leisure?
waltwhitman,Have you reckon'd that the landscape took substance and form that it
waltwhitman,might be painted in a picture?
waltwhitman,"Or men and women that they might be written of, and songs sung?"
waltwhitman,"Or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious combinations"
waltwhitman,"and the fluids of the air, as subjects for the savans?"
waltwhitman,Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?
waltwhitman,Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?
waltwhitman,"Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or"
waltwhitman,agriculture itself?
waltwhitman,"Old institutions, these arts, libraries, legends, collections, and"
waltwhitman,"the practice handed along in manufactures, will we rate them so high?"
waltwhitman,"Will we rate our cash and business high? I have no objection,"
waltwhitman,I rate them as high as the highest--then a child born of a woman and
waltwhitman,man I rate beyond all rate.
waltwhitman,"We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution grand,"
waltwhitman,"I do not say they are not grand and good, for they are,"
waltwhitman,"I am this day just as much in love with them as you,"
waltwhitman,"Then I am in love with You, and with all my fellows upon the earth."
waltwhitman,"We consider bibles and religions divine--I do not say they are not divine,"
waltwhitman,"I say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you still,"
waltwhitman,"It is not they who give the life, it is you who give the life,"
waltwhitman,"Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth,"
waltwhitman,than they are shed out of you.

waltwhitman,"The sum of all known reverence I add up in you whoever you are,"
waltwhitman,"The President is there in the White House for you, it is not you who"
waltwhitman,"are here for him,"
waltwhitman,"The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you, not you here for them,"
waltwhitman,"The Congress convenes every Twelfth-month for you,"
waltwhitman,"Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of cities, the"
waltwhitman,"going and coming of commerce and malls, are all for you."
waltwhitman,"List close my scholars dear,"
waltwhitman,"Doctrines, politics and civilization exurge from you,"
waltwhitman,"Sculpture and monuments and any thing inscribed anywhere are tallied in you,"
waltwhitman,The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records
waltwhitman,"reach is in you this hour, and myths and tales the same,"
waltwhitman,"If you were not breathing and walking here, where would they all be?"
waltwhitman,"The most renown'd poems would be ashes, orations and plays would"
waltwhitman,be vacuums.
waltwhitman,"All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it,"
waltwhitman,(Did you think it was in the white or gray stone? or the lines of
waltwhitman,the arches and cornices?)
waltwhitman,"All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the instruments,"
waltwhitman,"It is not the violins and the cornets, it is not the oboe nor the"
waltwhitman,"beating drums, nor the score of the baritone singer singing his"
waltwhitman,"sweet romanza, nor that of the men's chorus, nor that of the"
waltwhitman,"women's chorus,"
waltwhitman,It is nearer and farther than they.
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,Will the whole come back then?
waltwhitman,Can each see signs of the best by a look in the looking-glass? is
waltwhitman,there nothing greater or more?

waltwhitman,"Strange and hard that paradox true I give,"
waltwhitman,Objects gross and the unseen soul are one.

waltwhitman,BOOK XVI
waltwhitman,A Song of the Rolling Earth
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"A song of the rolling earth, and of words according,"
waltwhitman,"Were you thinking that those were the words, those upright lines?"
waltwhitman,"those curves, angles, dots?"
waltwhitman,"No, those are not the words, the substantial words are in the ground"
waltwhitman,"and sea,"
waltwhitman,"They are in the air, they are in you."
waltwhitman,"Were you thinking that those were the words, those delicious sounds"
waltwhitman,out of your friends' mouths?
waltwhitman,"No, the real words are more delicious than they."
waltwhitman,"Human bodies are words, myriads of words,"
waltwhitman,"(In the best poems re-appears the body, man's or woman's,"
waltwhitman,"well-shaped, natural, gay,"
waltwhitman,"Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the need of shame.)"
waltwhitman,"Air, soil, water, fire--those are words,"
waltwhitman,I myself am a word with them--my qualities interpenetrate with
waltwhitman,"theirs--my name is nothing to them,"
waltwhitman,"Though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would"
waltwhitman,"air, soil, water, fire, know of my name?"
waltwhitman,"A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words,"
waltwhitman,"sayings, meanings,"
waltwhitman,"The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women,"
waltwhitman,are sayings and meanings also.
waltwhitman,"The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the earth,"
waltwhitman,The masters know the earth's words and use them more than audible words.
waltwhitman,"Amelioration is one of the earth's words,"
waltwhitman,"The earth neither lags nor hastens,"
waltwhitman,"It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump,"
waltwhitman,"It is not half beautiful only, defects and excrescences show just as"
waltwhitman,much as perfections show.
waltwhitman,"The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough,"
waltwhitman,"The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so conceal'd either,"
waltwhitman,"They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print,"
waltwhitman,"They are imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly,"
waltwhitman,"Conveying a sentiment and invitation, I utter and utter,"
waltwhitman,"I speak not, yet if you hear me not of what avail am I to you?"
waltwhitman,"To bear, to better, lacking these of what avail am I?"
waltwhitman,(Accouche! accouchez!
waltwhitman,Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?
waltwhitman,Will you squat and stifle there?)
waltwhitman,"The earth does not argue,"
waltwhitman,"Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,"
waltwhitman,"Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,"
waltwhitman,"Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,"
waltwhitman,"Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,"
waltwhitman,"Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out."
waltwhitman,"The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit itself,"
waltwhitman,"possesses still underneath,"
waltwhitman,"Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the"
waltwhitman,"wail of slaves,"
waltwhitman,"Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young"
waltwhitman,"people, accents of bargainers,"
waltwhitman,Underneath these possessing words that never fall.
waltwhitman,"To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail,"
waltwhitman,"The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail and reflection"
waltwhitman,"does not fall,"
waltwhitman,"Also the day and night do not fall, and the voyage we pursue does not fall."
waltwhitman,"Of the interminable sisters,"
waltwhitman,"Of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters,"
waltwhitman,"Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger sisters,"
waltwhitman,The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.
waltwhitman,"With her ample back towards every beholder,"
waltwhitman,"With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age,"
waltwhitman,"Sits she whom I too love like the rest, sits undisturb'd,"
waltwhitman,"Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror, while her"
waltwhitman,"eyes glance back from it,"
waltwhitman,"Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,"
waltwhitman,Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.
waltwhitman,"Seen at hand or seen at a distance,"
waltwhitman,"Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,"
waltwhitman,"Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion,"
waltwhitman,"Looking from no countenances of their own, but from the countenances"
waltwhitman,"of those who are with them,"
waltwhitman,"From the countenances of children or women or the manly countenance,"
waltwhitman,"From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things,"
waltwhitman,"From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of the sky,"
waltwhitman,"From our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning them,"
waltwhitman,"Every day in public appearing without fall, but never twice with the"
waltwhitman,same companions.
waltwhitman,"Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred and"
waltwhitman,sixty-five resistlessly round the sun;
waltwhitman,"Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred and"
waltwhitman,"sixty-five offsets of the first, sure and necessary as they."
waltwhitman,"Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,"
waltwhitman,"Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding, passing, carrying,"
waltwhitman,"The soul's realization and determination still inheriting,"
waltwhitman,"The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing,"
waltwhitman,"No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking,"
waltwhitman,"Swift, glad, content, unbereav'd, nothing losing,"
waltwhitman,"Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account,"
waltwhitman,The divine ship sails the divine sea.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Whoever you are! motion and reflection are especially for you,"
waltwhitman,The divine ship sails the divine sea for you.
waltwhitman,"Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid,"
waltwhitman,"You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky,"
waltwhitman,"For none more than you are the present and the past,"
waltwhitman,For none more than you is immortality.
waltwhitman,"Each man to himself and each woman to herself, is the word of the"
waltwhitman,"past and present, and the true word of immortality;"
waltwhitman,"No one can acquire for another--not one,"
waltwhitman,Not one can grow for another--not one.
waltwhitman,"The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him,"
waltwhitman,"The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him,"
waltwhitman,"The murder is to the murderer, and comes back most to him,"
waltwhitman,"The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him,"
waltwhitman,"The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him,"
waltwhitman,"The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him--it cannot fail,"
waltwhitman,"The oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor and actress"
waltwhitman,"not to the audience,"
waltwhitman,"And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own, or"
waltwhitman,the indication of his own.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall
waltwhitman,"be complete,"
waltwhitman,The earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who remains
waltwhitman,jagged and broken.
waltwhitman,I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate those
waltwhitman,"of the earth,"
waltwhitman,There can be no theory of any account unless it corroborate the
waltwhitman,"theory of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"No politics, song, religion, behavior, or what not, is of account,"
waltwhitman,"unless it compare with the amplitude of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"Unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, rectitude of"
waltwhitman,the earth.
waltwhitman,I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which
waltwhitman,"responds love,"
waltwhitman,"It is that which contains itself, which never invites and never refuses."
waltwhitman,"I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words,"
waltwhitman,"All merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"Toward him who sings the songs of the body and of the truths of the earth,"
waltwhitman,Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print cannot touch.
waltwhitman,"I swear I see what is better than to tell the best,"
waltwhitman,It is always to leave the best untold.
waltwhitman,"When I undertake to tell the best I find I cannot,"
waltwhitman,"My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,"
waltwhitman,"My breath will not be obedient to its organs,"
waltwhitman,I become a dumb man.
waltwhitman,"The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow, all or any is best,"
waltwhitman,"It is not what you anticipated, it is cheaper, easier, nearer,"
waltwhitman,"Things are not dismiss'd from the places they held before,"
waltwhitman,"The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before,"
waltwhitman,"Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real as before,"
waltwhitman,"But the soul is also real, it too is positive and direct,"
waltwhitman,"No reasoning, no proof has establish'd it,"
waltwhitman,Undeniable growth has establish'd it.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"These to echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls,"
waltwhitman,(If they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they then?
waltwhitman,If they had not reference to you in especial what were they then?)
waltwhitman,I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells
waltwhitman,"the best,"
waltwhitman,I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold.
waltwhitman,"Say on, sayers! sing on, singers!"
waltwhitman,Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!
waltwhitman,"Work on, age after age, nothing is to be lost,"
waltwhitman,"It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use,"
waltwhitman,"When the materials are all prepared and ready, the architects shall appear."
waltwhitman,"I swear to you the architects shall appear without fall,"
waltwhitman,"I swear to you they will understand you and justify you,"
waltwhitman,"The greatest among them shall be he who best knows you, and encloses"
waltwhitman,"all and is faithful to all,"
waltwhitman,"He and the rest shall not forget you, they shall perceive that you"
waltwhitman,"are not an iota less than they,"
waltwhitman,You shall be fully glorified in them.
waltwhitman,"Youth, Day, Old Age and Night"
waltwhitman,"Youth, large, lusty, loving--youth full of grace, force, fascination,"
waltwhitman,"Do you know that Old Age may come after you with equal grace,"
waltwhitman,"force, fascination?"
waltwhitman,"Day full-blown and splendid-day of the immense sun, action,"
waltwhitman,"ambition, laughter,"
waltwhitman,"The Night follows close with millions of suns, and sleep and"
waltwhitman,restoring darkness.

waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Come said the Muse,"
waltwhitman,"Sing me a song no poet yet has chanted,"
waltwhitman,Sing me the universal.
waltwhitman,"In this broad earth of ours,"
waltwhitman,"Amid the measureless grossness and the slag,"
waltwhitman,"Enclosed and safe within its central heart,"
waltwhitman,Nestles the seed perfection.
waltwhitman,"By every life a share or more or less,"
waltwhitman,"None born but it is born, conceal'd or unconceal'd the seed is waiting."
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Lo! keen-eyed towering science,"
waltwhitman,"As from tall peaks the modern overlooking,"
waltwhitman,Successive absolute fiats issuing.
waltwhitman,"Yet again, lo! the soul, above all science,"
waltwhitman,"For it has history gather'd like husks around the globe,"
waltwhitman,For it the entire star-myriads roll through the sky.
waltwhitman,"In spiral routes by long detours,"
waltwhitman,"(As a much-tacking ship upon the sea,)"
waltwhitman,"For it the partial to the permanent flowing,"
waltwhitman,For it the real to the ideal tends.
waltwhitman,"For it the mystic evolution,"
waltwhitman,"Not the right only justified, what we call evil also justified."
waltwhitman,"Forth from their masks, no matter what,"
waltwhitman,"From the huge festering trunk, from craft and guile and tears,"
waltwhitman,"Health to emerge and joy, joy universal."
waltwhitman,"Out of the bulk, the morbid and the shallow,"
waltwhitman,"Out of the bad majority, the varied countless frauds of men and states,"
waltwhitman,"Electric, antiseptic yet, cleaving, suffusing all,"
waltwhitman,Only the good is universal.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"Over the mountain-growths disease and sorrow,"
waltwhitman,"An uncaught bird is ever hovering, hovering,"
waltwhitman,"High in the purer, happier air."
waltwhitman,"From imperfection's murkiest cloud,"
waltwhitman,"Darts always forth one ray of perfect light,"
waltwhitman,One flash of heaven's glory.
waltwhitman,"To fashion's, custom's discord,"
waltwhitman,"To the mad Babel-din, the deafening orgies,"
waltwhitman,"Soothing each lull a strain is heard, just heard,"
waltwhitman,From some far shore the final chorus sounding.
waltwhitman,"O the blest eyes, the happy hearts,"
waltwhitman,"That see, that know the guiding thread so fine,"
waltwhitman,Along the mighty labyrinth.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"And thou America,"
waltwhitman,"For the scheme's culmination, its thought and its reality,"
waltwhitman,For these (not for thyself) thou hast arrived.
waltwhitman,"Thou too surroundest all,"
waltwhitman,"Embracing carrying welcoming all, thou too by pathways broad and new,"
waltwhitman,To the ideal tendest.
waltwhitman,"The measure'd faiths of other lands, the grandeurs of the past,"
waltwhitman,"Are not for thee, but grandeurs of thine own,"
waltwhitman,"Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending all,"
waltwhitman,All eligible to all.
waltwhitman,"All, all for immortality,"
waltwhitman,"Love like the light silently wrapping all,"
waltwhitman,"Nature's amelioration blessing all,"
waltwhitman,"The blossoms, fruits of ages, orchards divine and certain,"
waltwhitman,"Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual images ripening."
waltwhitman,"Give me O God to sing that thought,"
waltwhitman,"Give me, give him or her I love this quenchless faith,"
waltwhitman,"In Thy ensemble, whatever else withheld withhold not from us,"
waltwhitman,"Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space,"
waltwhitman,"Health, peace, salvation universal."
waltwhitman,Is it a dream?
waltwhitman,"Nay but the lack of it the dream,"
waltwhitman,"And failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,"
waltwhitman,And all the world a dream.
waltwhitman,Pioneers! O Pioneers!
waltwhitman,"Come my tan-faced children,"
waltwhitman,"Follow well in order, get your weapons ready,"
waltwhitman,Have you your pistols? have you your sharp-edged axes?
waltwhitman,Pioneers! O pioneers!
waltwhitman,"For we cannot tarry here,"
waltwhitman,"We must march my darlings, we must bear the brunt of danger,"
waltwhitman,"We the youthful sinewy races, all the rest on us depend,"

waltwhitman,Have the elder races halted?
waltwhitman,"Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond the seas?"
waltwhitman,"We take up the task eternal, and the burden and the lesson,"
waltwhitman,Pioneers! O pioneers!

waltwhitman,"We debouch upon a newer mightier world, varied world,"
waltwhitman,"Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and the march,"

waltwhitman,"From the peaks gigantic, from the great sierras and the high plateaus,"

waltwhitman,"of gold-color'd light,"
waltwhitman,"From my hand from the brain of every man and woman it streams,"
waltwhitman,effulgently flowing forever.
waltwhitman,O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!
waltwhitman,"You have not known what you are, you have slumber'd upon yourself"
waltwhitman,"all your life,"
waltwhitman,"Your eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time,"
waltwhitman,"What you have done returns already in mockeries,"
waltwhitman,"(Your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in"
waltwhitman,"mockeries, what is their return?)"
waltwhitman,"The mockeries are not you,"
waltwhitman,"Underneath them and within them I see you lurk,"
waltwhitman,"I pursue you where none else has pursued you,"
waltwhitman,"Silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the"
waltwhitman,"accustom'd routine, if these conceal you from others or from"
waltwhitman,"yourself, they do not conceal you from me,"

waltwhitman,the songs of the glory of you.
waltwhitman,Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!
waltwhitman,"These shows of the East and West are tame compared to you,"
waltwhitman,"These immense meadows, these interminable rivers, you are immense"
waltwhitman,"and interminable as they,"
waltwhitman,"These furies, elements, storms, motions of Nature, throes of apparent"
waltwhitman,"dissolution, you are he or she who is master or mistress over them,"
waltwhitman,"Master or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements, pain,"
waltwhitman,"passion, dissolution."
waltwhitman,"The hopples fall from your ankles, you find an unfailing sufficiency,"

waltwhitman,"A harsh discordant natal scream out-sounding, to touch the mother's"
waltwhitman,heart closer than any yet.
waltwhitman,"I walk'd the shores of my Eastern sea,"
waltwhitman,"Heard over the waves the little voice,"
waltwhitman,"Saw the divine infant where she woke mournfully wailing, amid the"
waltwhitman,"roar of cannon, curses, shouts, crash of falling buildings,"
waltwhitman,"Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running, nor from the single"
waltwhitman,"corpses, nor those in heaps, nor those borne away in the tumbrils,"
waltwhitman,Was not so desperate at the battues of death--was not so shock'd at
waltwhitman,the repeated fusillades of the guns.
waltwhitman,"Pale, silent, stern, what could I say to that long-accrued retribution?"
waltwhitman,Could I wish humanity different?
waltwhitman,Could I wish the people made of wood and stone?

waltwhitman,Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance.
waltwhitman,"Hence I sign this salute over the sea,"
waltwhitman,"And I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,"
waltwhitman,"But remember the little voice that I heard wailing, and wait with"
waltwhitman,"perfect trust, no matter how long,"
waltwhitman,"And from to-day sad and cogent I maintain the bequeath'd cause, as"
waltwhitman,"for all lands,"
waltwhitman,"And I send these words to Paris with my love,"
waltwhitman,"And I guess some chansonniers there will understand them,"
waltwhitman,"For I guess there is latent music yet in France, floods of it,"

waltwhitman,"drowning all that would interrupt them,"
waltwhitman,"O I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,"

waltwhitman,"Not for an embroiderer,"
waltwhitman,"(There will always be plenty of embroiderers, I welcome them also,)"
waltwhitman,But for the fibre of things and for inherent men and women.
waltwhitman,"Not to chisel ornaments,"

waltwhitman,Year of meteors! brooding year!
waltwhitman,"I would bind in words retrospective some of your deeds and signs,"
waltwhitman,"I would sing your contest for the 19th Presidentiad,"
waltwhitman,"I would sing how an old man, tall, with white hair, mounted the"
waltwhitman,"scaffold in Virginia,"
waltwhitman,"(I was at hand, silent I stood with teeth shut close, I watch'd,"
waltwhitman,"I stood very near you old man when cool and indifferent, but trembling"
waltwhitman,with age and your unheal'd wounds you mounted the scaffold;)
waltwhitman,"I would sing in my copious song your census returns of the States,"
waltwhitman,"The tables of population and products, I would sing of your ships"
waltwhitman,"and their cargoes,"
waltwhitman,"The proud black ships of Manhattan arriving, some fill'd with"
waltwhitman,"immigrants, some from the isthmus with cargoes of gold,"
waltwhitman,"Songs thereof would I sing, to all that hitherward comes would welcome give,"

waltwhitman,"over our heads,"
waltwhitman,"(A moment, a moment long it sail'd its balls of unearthly light over"
waltwhitman,"our heads,"
waltwhitman,"Then departed, dropt in the night, and was gone;)"

waltwhitman,"gleam and patch these chants,"
waltwhitman,"Your chants, O year all mottled with evil and good--year of forebodings!"
waltwhitman,Year of comets and meteors transient and strange--lo! even here one
waltwhitman,equally transient and strange!

waltwhitman,"As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,"
waltwhitman,"Borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,"
waltwhitman,"A man, yet by these tears a little boy again,"
waltwhitman,"Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,"
waltwhitman,"I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,"
waltwhitman,"Taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,"
waltwhitman,A reminiscence sing.
waltwhitman,"Once Paumanok,"
waltwhitman,"When the lilac-scent was in the air and Fifth-month grass was growing,"
waltwhitman,"Up this seashore in some briers,"
waltwhitman,"Two feather'd guests from Alabama, two together,"
waltwhitman,"And their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown,"
waltwhitman,"And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,"
waltwhitman,"And every day the she-bird crouch'd on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,"
waltwhitman,"And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing"
waltwhitman,"them,"
waltwhitman,"Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating."
waltwhitman,Shine! shine! shine!
waltwhitman,"Pour down your warmth, great sun.'"
waltwhitman,"While we bask, we two together."
waltwhitman,Two together!
waltwhitman,"Winds blow south, or winds blow north,"
waltwhitman,"Day come white, or night come black,"
waltwhitman,"Home, or rivers and mountains from home,"
waltwhitman,"Singing all time, minding no time,"
waltwhitman,While we two keep together.
waltwhitman,"Till of a sudden,"
waltwhitman,"May-be kill'd, unknown to her mate,"
waltwhitman,"One forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on the nest,"
waltwhitman,"Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,"
waltwhitman,Nor ever appear'd again.
waltwhitman,"And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,"
waltwhitman,"And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather,"
waltwhitman,"Over the hoarse surging of the sea,"
waltwhitman,"Or flitting from brier to brier by day,"
waltwhitman,"I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,"
waltwhitman,The solitary guest from Alabama.
waltwhitman,Blow! blow! blow!
waltwhitman,Blow up sea-winds along Paumanok's shore;
waltwhitman,I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me.
waltwhitman,"Yes, when the stars glisten'd,"
waltwhitman,"All night long on the prong of a moss-scallop'd stake,"
waltwhitman,"Down almost amid the slapping waves,"
waltwhitman,Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears.
waltwhitman,"He call'd on his mate,"
waltwhitman,He pour'd forth the meanings which I of all men know.
waltwhitman,"Yes my brother I know,"
waltwhitman,"The rest might not, but I have treasur'd every note,"
waltwhitman,"For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding,"
waltwhitman,"Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows,"
waltwhitman,"Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights"
waltwhitman,"after their sorts,"
waltwhitman,"The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,"
waltwhitman,"I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,"
waltwhitman,Listen'd long and long.
waltwhitman,"Listen'd to keep, to sing, now translating the notes,"
waltwhitman,Following you my brother.
waltwhitman,Soothe! soothe! soothe!
waltwhitman,"Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,"
waltwhitman,"And again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close,"
waltwhitman,"But my love soothes not me, not me."
waltwhitman,"Low hangs the moon, it rose late,"
waltwhitman,"It is lagging--O I think it is heavy with love, with love."
waltwhitman,"O madly the sea pushes upon the land,"
waltwhitman,"With love, with love."
waltwhitman,O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers?
waltwhitman,What is that little black thing I see there in the white?
waltwhitman,Loud! loud! loud!
waltwhitman,"Loud I call to you, my love!"
waltwhitman,"High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves,"
waltwhitman,"Surely you must know who is here, is here,"
waltwhitman,"You must know who I am, my love."
waltwhitman,Low-hanging moon!
waltwhitman,What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?
waltwhitman,"O it is the shape, the shape of my mate.'"
waltwhitman,O moon do not keep her from me any longer.
waltwhitman,Land! land! O land!
waltwhitman,"Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again"
waltwhitman,"if you only would,"
waltwhitman,For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.
waltwhitman,O rising stars!
waltwhitman,"Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you."
waltwhitman,O throat! O trembling throat!
waltwhitman,Sound clearer through the atmosphere!
waltwhitman,"Pierce the woods, the earth,"
waltwhitman,Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want.
waltwhitman,Shake out carols!
waltwhitman,"Solitary here, the night's carols!"
waltwhitman,Carols of lonesome love! death's carols!
waltwhitman,"Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!"
waltwhitman,O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea!
waltwhitman,O reckless despairing carols.
waltwhitman,But soft! sink low!
waltwhitman,"Soft! let me just murmur,"
waltwhitman,"And do you wait a moment you husky-nois'd sea,"
waltwhitman,"For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,"
waltwhitman,"So faint, I must be still, be still to listen,"
waltwhitman,"But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me."
waltwhitman,Hither my love!
waltwhitman,Here I am! here!
waltwhitman,"With this just-sustain'd note I announce myself to you,"
waltwhitman,"This gentle call is for you my love, for you."
waltwhitman,"Do not be decoy'd elsewhere,"
waltwhitman,"That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice,"
waltwhitman,"That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray,"
waltwhitman,Those are the shadows of leaves.
waltwhitman,O darkness! O in vain!
waltwhitman,O I am very sick and sorrowful
waltwhitman,"O brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea!"
waltwhitman,O troubled reflection in the sea!
waltwhitman,O throat! O throbbing heart!
waltwhitman,"And I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night."
waltwhitman,O past! O happy life! O songs of joy!
waltwhitman,"In the air, in the woods, over fields,"
waltwhitman,Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!
waltwhitman,"But my mate no more, no more with me!"
waltwhitman,We two together no more.
waltwhitman,"The aria sinking,"
waltwhitman,"All else continuing, the stars shining,"
waltwhitman,"The winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing,"
waltwhitman,"With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,"
waltwhitman,"On the sands of Paumanok's shore gray and rustling,"
waltwhitman,"The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of"
waltwhitman,"the sea almost touching,"
waltwhitman,"The boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the"
waltwhitman,"atmosphere dallying,"
waltwhitman,"The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously"
waltwhitman,"bursting,"
waltwhitman,"The aria's meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,"
waltwhitman,"The strange tears down the cheeks coursing,"
waltwhitman,"The colloquy there, the trio, each uttering,"
waltwhitman,"The undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying,"
waltwhitman,"To the boy's soul's questions sullenly timing, some drown'd secret hissing,"
waltwhitman,To the outsetting bard.
waltwhitman,"Demon or bird! (said the boy's soul,)"
waltwhitman,Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?
waltwhitman,"For I, that was a child, my tongue's use sleeping, now I have heard you,"
waltwhitman,"Now in a moment I know what I am for, I awake,"
waltwhitman,"And already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer, louder"
waltwhitman,"and more sorrowful than yours,"
waltwhitman,"A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, never to die."
waltwhitman,"O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me,"
waltwhitman,"O solitary me listening, never more shall I cease perpetuating you,"
waltwhitman,"Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,"
waltwhitman,"Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,"
waltwhitman,Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what
waltwhitman,"there in the night,"
waltwhitman,"By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon,"
waltwhitman,"The messenger there arous'd, the fire, the sweet hell within,"
waltwhitman,"The unknown want, the destiny of me."
waltwhitman,"O give me the clue! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,)"
waltwhitman,"O if I am to have so much, let me have more!"
waltwhitman,"A word then, (for I will conquer it,)"
waltwhitman,"The word final, superior to all,"
waltwhitman,"Subtle, sent up--what is it?--I listen;"
waltwhitman,"Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?"
waltwhitman,Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?
waltwhitman,"Whereto answering, the sea,"
waltwhitman,"Delaying not, hurrying not,"
waltwhitman,"Whisper'd me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,"
waltwhitman,"Lisp'd to me the low and delicious word death,"
waltwhitman,"And again death, death, death, death"
waltwhitman,"Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd child's heart,"
waltwhitman,"But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,"
waltwhitman,"Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,"
waltwhitman,"Death, death, death, death, death."
waltwhitman,Which I do not forget.
waltwhitman,"But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,"
waltwhitman,"That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok's gray beach,"
waltwhitman,"With the thousand responsive songs at random,"
waltwhitman,"My own songs awaked from that hour,"
waltwhitman,"And with them the key, the word up from the waves,"
waltwhitman,"The word of the sweetest song and all songs,"
waltwhitman,"That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,"
waltwhitman,"(Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet"
waltwhitman,"garments, bending aside,)"
waltwhitman,The sea whisper'd me.
waltwhitman,As I Ebb'd with the Ocean of Life
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"As I ebb'd with the ocean of life,"
waltwhitman,"As I wended the shores I know,"
waltwhitman,"As I walk'd where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok,"
waltwhitman,"Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant,"
waltwhitman,"Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,"
waltwhitman,"I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,"
waltwhitman,"Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems,"
waltwhitman,"Was seiz'd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,"
waltwhitman,"The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land"
waltwhitman,of the globe.
waltwhitman,"Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow those"
waltwhitman,"slender windrows,"
waltwhitman,"Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,"
waltwhitman,"Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the tide,"
waltwhitman,"Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,"
waltwhitman,"Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses,"
waltwhitman,"These you presented to me you fish-shaped island,"
waltwhitman,"As I wended the shores I know,"
waltwhitman,As I walk'd with that electric self seeking types.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"As I wend to the shores I know not,"
waltwhitman,"As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck'd,"
waltwhitman,"As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,"
waltwhitman,"As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,"
waltwhitman,"I too but signify at the utmost a little wash'd-up drift,"
waltwhitman,"A few sands and dead leaves to gather,"
waltwhitman,"Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift."
waltwhitman,"O baffled, balk'd, bent to the very earth,"
waltwhitman,"Oppress'd with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,"
waltwhitman,Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have
waltwhitman,"not once had the least idea who or what I am,"
waltwhitman,But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet
waltwhitman,"untouch'd, untold, altogether unreach'd,"
waltwhitman,"Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows,"
waltwhitman,"With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written,"
waltwhitman,"Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath."
waltwhitman,"I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single"
waltwhitman,"object, and that no man ever can,"
waltwhitman,Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon
waltwhitman,"me and sting me,"
waltwhitman,Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"You oceans both, I close with you,"
waltwhitman,"We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift, knowing not why,"
waltwhitman,These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all.
waltwhitman,"You friable shore with trails of debris,"
waltwhitman,"You fish-shaped island, I take what is underfoot,"
waltwhitman,What is yours is mine my father.
waltwhitman,"I too Paumanok,"
waltwhitman,"I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been"
waltwhitman,"wash'd on your shores,"
waltwhitman,"I too am but a trail of drift and debris,"
waltwhitman,"I too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island."
waltwhitman,"I throw myself upon your breast my father,"
waltwhitman,"I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,"
waltwhitman,I hold you so firm till you answer me something.
waltwhitman,"Kiss me my father,"
waltwhitman,"Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love,"
waltwhitman,Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring I envy.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"Ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,)"
waltwhitman,"Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother,"
waltwhitman,"Endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me,"
waltwhitman,Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you or
waltwhitman,gather from you.
waltwhitman,"I mean tenderly by you and all,"
waltwhitman,"I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead,"
waltwhitman,and following me and mine.
waltwhitman,"Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses,"
waltwhitman,"Froth, snowy white, and bubbles,"
waltwhitman,"(See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last,"
waltwhitman,"See, the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,)"
waltwhitman,"Tufts of straw, sands, fragments,"
waltwhitman,"Buoy'd hither from many moods, one contradicting another,"
waltwhitman,"From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell,"
waltwhitman,"Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil,"
waltwhitman,"Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown,"
waltwhitman,"A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating,"
waltwhitman,"drifted at random,"
waltwhitman,"Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature,"
waltwhitman,"Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets,"
waltwhitman,"We, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out before you,"
waltwhitman,"You up there walking or sitting,"
waltwhitman,"Whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet."
waltwhitman,Tears
waltwhitman,Tears! tears! tears!
waltwhitman,"In the night, in solitude, tears,"
waltwhitman,"On the white shore dripping, dripping, suck'd in by the sand,"
waltwhitman,"Tears, not a star shining, all dark and desolate,"
waltwhitman,Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head;
waltwhitman,"O who is that ghost? that form in the dark, with tears?"
waltwhitman,"What shapeless lump is that, bent, crouch'd there on the sand?"
waltwhitman,"Streaming tears, sobbing tears, throes, choked with wild cries;"
waltwhitman,"O storm, embodied, rising, careering with swift steps along the beach!"
waltwhitman,"O wild and dismal night storm, with wind--O belching and desperate!"
waltwhitman,"O shade so sedate and decorous by day, with calm countenance and"
waltwhitman,"regulated pace,"
waltwhitman,"But away at night as you fly, none looking--O then the unloosen'd ocean,"
waltwhitman,Of tears! tears! tears!
waltwhitman,To the Man-of-War-Bird
waltwhitman,"Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm,"
waltwhitman,"Waking renew'd on thy prodigious pinions,"
waltwhitman,"(Burst the wild storm? above it thou ascended'st,"
waltwhitman,"And rested on the sky, thy slave that cradled thee,)"
waltwhitman,"Now a blue point, far, far in heaven floating,"
waltwhitman,"As to the light emerging here on deck I watch thee,"
waltwhitman,"(Myself a speck, a point on the world's floating vast.)"
waltwhitman,"Far, far at sea,"
waltwhitman,"After the night's fierce drifts have strewn the shore with wrecks,"
waltwhitman,"With re-appearing day as now so happy and serene,"
waltwhitman,"The rosy and elastic dawn, the flashing sun,"
waltwhitman,"The limpid spread of air cerulean,"
waltwhitman,Thou also re-appearest.
waltwhitman,"Thou born to match the gale, (thou art all wings,)"
waltwhitman,"To cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurricane,"
waltwhitman,"Thou ship of air that never furl'st thy sails,"
waltwhitman,"Days, even weeks untired and onward, through spaces, realms gyrating,"
waltwhitman,"At dusk that lookist on Senegal, at morn America,"
waltwhitman,"That sport'st amid the lightning-flash and thunder-cloud,"
waltwhitman,"In them, in thy experiences, had'st thou my soul,"
waltwhitman,What joys! what joys were thine!
waltwhitman,Aboard at a Ship's Helm
waltwhitman,"Aboard at a ship's helm,"
waltwhitman,A young steersman steering with care.
waltwhitman,"Through fog on a sea-coast dolefully ringing,"
waltwhitman,"An ocean-bell--O a warning bell, rock'd by the waves."
waltwhitman,"O you give good notice indeed, you bell by the sea-reefs ringing,"
waltwhitman,"Ringing, ringing, to warn the ship from its wreck-place."
waltwhitman,"For as on the alert O steersman, you mind the loud admonition,"
waltwhitman,"The bows turn, the freighted ship tacking speeds away under her gray sails,"
waltwhitman,The beautiful and noble ship with all her precious wealth speeds
waltwhitman,away gayly and safe.
waltwhitman,"But O the ship, the immortal ship! O ship aboard the ship!"
waltwhitman,"Ship of the body, ship of the soul, voyaging, voyaging, voyaging."
waltwhitman,On the Beach at Night
waltwhitman,"On the beach at night,"
waltwhitman,"Stands a child with her father,"
waltwhitman,"Watching the east, the autumn sky."
waltwhitman,"Up through the darkness,"
waltwhitman,"While ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading,"
waltwhitman,"Lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky,"
waltwhitman,"Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east,"
waltwhitman,"Ascends large and calm the lord-star Jupiter,"
waltwhitman,"And nigh at hand, only a very little above,"
waltwhitman,Swim the delicate sisters the Pleiades.
waltwhitman,"From the beach the child holding the hand of her father,"
waltwhitman,"Those burial-clouds that lower victorious soon to devour all,"
waltwhitman,"Watching, silently weeps."
waltwhitman,"Weep not, child,"
waltwhitman,"Weep not, my darling,"
waltwhitman,"With these kisses let me remove your tears,"
waltwhitman,"The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious,"
waltwhitman,"They shall not long possess the sky, they devour the stars only in"
waltwhitman,"apparition,"
waltwhitman,"Jupiter shall emerge, be patient, watch again another night, the"
waltwhitman,"Pleiades shall emerge,"
waltwhitman,"They are immortal, all those stars both silvery and golden shall"
waltwhitman,"shine out again,"
waltwhitman,"The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again, they endure,"
waltwhitman,The vast immortal suns and the long-enduring pensive moons shall
waltwhitman,again shine.
waltwhitman,Then dearest child mournest thou only for jupiter?
waltwhitman,Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars?
waltwhitman,"Something there is,"
waltwhitman,"(With my lips soothing thee, adding I whisper,"
waltwhitman,"I give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,)"
waltwhitman,"Something there is more immortal even than the stars,"
waltwhitman,"(Many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,)"
waltwhitman,Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter
waltwhitman,"Longer than sun or any revolving satellite,"
waltwhitman,Or the radiant sisters the Pleiades.
waltwhitman,The World below the Brine
waltwhitman,"The world below the brine,"
waltwhitman,"Forests at the bottom of the sea, the branches and leaves,"
waltwhitman,"Sea-lettuce, vast lichens, strange flowers and seeds, the thick"
waltwhitman,"tangle openings, and pink turf,"
waltwhitman,"Different colors, pale gray and green, purple, white, and gold, the"
waltwhitman,"play of light through the water,"
waltwhitman,"Dumb swimmers there among the rocks, coral, gluten, grass, rushes,"
waltwhitman,"and the aliment of the swimmers,"
waltwhitman,"Sluggish existences grazing there suspended, or slowly crawling"
waltwhitman,"close to the bottom,"
waltwhitman,"The sperm-whale at the surface blowing air and spray, or disporting"
waltwhitman,"with his flukes,"
waltwhitman,"The leaden-eyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy"
waltwhitman,"sea-leopard, and the sting-ray,"
waltwhitman,"Passions there, wars, pursuits, tribes, sight in those ocean-depths,"
waltwhitman,"breathing that thick-breathing air, as so many do,"
waltwhitman,"The change thence to the sight here, and to the subtle air breathed"
waltwhitman,"by beings like us who walk this sphere,"
waltwhitman,The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres.
waltwhitman,On the Beach at Night Alone
waltwhitman,"On the beach at night alone,"
waltwhitman,"As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song,"
waltwhitman,"As I watch the bright stars shining, I think a thought of the clef"
waltwhitman,of the universes and of the future.
waltwhitman,"A vast similitude interlocks all,"
waltwhitman,"All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,"
waltwhitman,"All distances of place however wide,"
waltwhitman,"All distances of time, all inanimate forms,"
waltwhitman,"All souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different, or in"
waltwhitman,"different worlds,"
waltwhitman,"All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes, the fishes, the brutes,"
waltwhitman,"All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages,"
waltwhitman,"All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe, or any globe,"
waltwhitman,"All lives and deaths, all of the past, present, future,"
waltwhitman,"This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann'd,"
waltwhitman,And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them.
waltwhitman,"Song for All Seas, All Ships"
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"To-day a rude brief recitative,"
waltwhitman,"Of ships sailing the seas, each with its special flag or ship-signal,"
waltwhitman,Of unnamed heroes in the ships--of waves spreading and spreading
waltwhitman,"far as the eye can reach,"
waltwhitman,"Of dashing spray, and the winds piping and blowing,"
waltwhitman,"And out of these a chant for the sailors of all nations,"
waltwhitman,"Fitful, like a surge."
waltwhitman,"Of sea-captains young or old, and the mates, and of all intrepid sailors,"
waltwhitman,"Of the few, very choice, taciturn, whom fate can never surprise nor"
waltwhitman,death dismay.
waltwhitman,"Pick'd sparingly without noise by thee old ocean, chosen by thee,"
waltwhitman,"Thou sea that pickest and cullest the race in time, and unitest nations,"
waltwhitman,"Suckled by thee, old husky nurse, embodying thee,"
waltwhitman,"Indomitable, untamed as thee."
waltwhitman,"(Ever the heroes on water or on land, by ones or twos appearing,"
waltwhitman,"Ever the stock preserv'd and never lost, though rare, enough for"
waltwhitman,seed preserv'd.)
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,Flaunt out O sea your separate flags of nations!
waltwhitman,Flaunt out visible as ever the various ship-signals!
waltwhitman,But do you reserve especially for yourself and for the soul of man
waltwhitman,"one flag above all the rest,"
waltwhitman,"A spiritual woven signal for all nations, emblem of man elate above death,"
waltwhitman,"Token of all brave captains and all intrepid sailors and mates,"
waltwhitman,"And all that went down doing their duty,"
waltwhitman,"Reminiscent of them, twined from all intrepid captains young or old,"
waltwhitman,"A pennant universal, subtly waving all time, o'er all brave sailors,"
waltwhitman,"All seas, all ships."
waltwhitman,Patroling Barnegat
waltwhitman,"Wild, wild the storm, and the sea high running,"
waltwhitman,"Steady the roar of the gale, with incessant undertone muttering,"
waltwhitman,"Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing,"
waltwhitman,"Waves, air, midnight, their savagest trinity lashing,"
waltwhitman,"Out in the shadows there milk-white combs careering,"
waltwhitman,"On beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting,"
waltwhitman,"Where through the murk the easterly death-wind breasting,"
waltwhitman,"Through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing,"
waltwhitman,(That in the distance! is that a wreck? is the red signal flaring?)
waltwhitman,"Slush and sand of the beach tireless till daylight wending,"
waltwhitman,"Steadily, slowly, through hoarse roar never remitting,"
waltwhitman,"Along the midnight edge by those milk-white combs careering,"
waltwhitman,"A group of dim, weird forms, struggling, the night confronting,"
waltwhitman,That savage trinity warily watching.
waltwhitman,After the Sea-Ship
waltwhitman,"After the sea-ship, after the whistling winds,"
waltwhitman,"After the white-gray sails taut to their spars and ropes,"
waltwhitman,"Below, a myriad myriad waves hastening, lifting up their necks,"
waltwhitman,"Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship,"
waltwhitman,"Waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling, blithely prying,"
waltwhitman,"Waves, undulating waves, liquid, uneven, emulous waves,"
waltwhitman,"Toward that whirling current, laughing and buoyant, with curves,"
waltwhitman,"Where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface,"
waltwhitman,"Larger and smaller waves in the spread of the ocean yearnfully flowing,"
waltwhitman,"The wake of the sea-ship after she passes, flashing and frolicsome"
waltwhitman,"under the sun,"
waltwhitman,"A motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments,"
waltwhitman,"Following the stately and rapid ship, in the wake following."

waltwhitman,How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!
waltwhitman,"Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town."
waltwhitman,"A fog follows, antiques of the same come limping,"
waltwhitman,"Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless."
waltwhitman,Why this is indeed a show--it has called the dead out of the earth!
waltwhitman,The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see!
waltwhitman,Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!
waltwhitman,Cock'd hats of mothy mould--crutches made of mist!
waltwhitman,Arms in slings--old men leaning on young men's shoulders.
waltwhitman,What troubles you Yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering of
waltwhitman,bare gums?
waltwhitman,Does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches for
waltwhitman,firelocks and level them?
waltwhitman,"If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President's marshal,"
waltwhitman,If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon.
waltwhitman,"For shame old maniacs--bring down those toss'd arms, and let your"
waltwhitman,"white hair be,"
waltwhitman,"Here gape your great grandsons, their wives gaze at them from the windows,"
waltwhitman,"See how well dress'd, see how orderly they conduct themselves."
waltwhitman,Worse and worse--can't you stand it? are you retreating?
waltwhitman,Is this hour with the living too dead for you?
waltwhitman,Retreat then--pell-mell!
waltwhitman,To your graves--back--back to the hills old limpers!
waltwhitman,I do not think you belong here anyhow.
waltwhitman,But there is one thing that belongs here--shall I tell you what it
waltwhitman,"is, gentlemen of Boston?"
waltwhitman,"I will whisper it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to England,"
waltwhitman,"They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the"
waltwhitman,"royal vault,"
waltwhitman,"Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the"
waltwhitman,"graveclothes, box up his bones for a journey,"
waltwhitman,"Find a swift Yankee clipper--here is freight for you, black-bellied clipper,"
waltwhitman,Up with your anchor--shake out your sails--steer straight toward
waltwhitman,Boston bay.
waltwhitman,"Now call for the President's marshal again, bring out the government cannon,"
waltwhitman,"Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession,"
waltwhitman,guard it with foot and dragoons.
waltwhitman,This centre-piece for them;
waltwhitman,"Look, all orderly citizens--look from the windows, women!"
waltwhitman,"The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that"
waltwhitman,"will not stay,"
waltwhitman,"Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull."
waltwhitman,"You have got your revenge, old buster--the crown is come to its own,"
waltwhitman,and more than its own.
waltwhitman,"Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan--you are a made man from"
waltwhitman,"this day,"
waltwhitman,You are mighty cute--and here is one of your bargains.
waltwhitman,Europe [The 72d and 73d Years of These States]
waltwhitman,"Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,"
waltwhitman,"Like lightning it le'pt forth half startled at itself,"
waltwhitman,"Its feet upon the ashes and the rags, its hands tight to the throats"
waltwhitman,of kings.
waltwhitman,O hope and faith!
waltwhitman,O aching close of exiled patriots' lives!
waltwhitman,O many a sicken'd heart!
waltwhitman,Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh.
waltwhitman,"And you, paid to defile the People--you liars, mark!"
waltwhitman,"Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,"
waltwhitman,"For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his"
waltwhitman,"simplicity the poor man's wages,"
waltwhitman,For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh'd at in
waltwhitman,"the breaking,"
waltwhitman,"Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge,"
waltwhitman,or the heads of the nobles fall;
waltwhitman,The People scorn'd the ferocity of kings.
waltwhitman,"But the sweetness of mercy brew'd bitter destruction, and the"
waltwhitman,"frighten'd monarchs come back,"
waltwhitman,"Each comes in state with his train, hangman, priest, tax-gatherer,"
waltwhitman,"Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant."
waltwhitman,"Yet behind all lowering stealing, lo, a shape,"
waltwhitman,"Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in"
waltwhitman,"scarlet folds,"
waltwhitman,"Whose face and eyes none may see,"
waltwhitman,"Out of its robes only this, the red robes lifted by the arm,"
waltwhitman,"One finger crook'd pointed high over the top, like the head of a"
waltwhitman,snake appears.
waltwhitman,"Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves, bloody corpses of young men,"
waltwhitman,"The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are"
waltwhitman,"flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud,"
waltwhitman,"And all these things bear fruits, and they are good."
waltwhitman,"Those corpses of young men,"
waltwhitman,"Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets, those hearts pierc'd by"
waltwhitman,"the gray lead,"
waltwhitman,Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughter'd vitality.
waltwhitman,They live in other young men O kings!
waltwhitman,"They live in brothers again ready to defy you,"
waltwhitman,"They were purified by death, they were taught and exalted."
waltwhitman,"Not a grave of the murder'd for freedom but grows seed for freedom,"
waltwhitman,"in its turn to bear seed,"
waltwhitman,"Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the snows nourish."
waltwhitman,"Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,"
waltwhitman,"But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling, cautioning."
waltwhitman,"Liberty, let others despair of you--I never despair of you."
waltwhitman,Is the house shut? is the master away?
waltwhitman,"Nevertheless, be ready, be not weary of watching,"
waltwhitman,"He will soon return, his messengers come anon."
waltwhitman,A Hand-Mirror
waltwhitman,"Hold it up sternly--see this it sends back, (who is it? is it you?)"
waltwhitman,"Outside fair costume, within ashes and filth,"
waltwhitman,"No more a flashing eye, no more a sonorous voice or springy step,"
waltwhitman,"Now some slave's eye, voice, hands, step,"
waltwhitman,"A drunkard's breath, unwholesome eater's face, venerealee's flesh,"
waltwhitman,"Lungs rotting away piecemeal, stomach sour and cankerous,"
waltwhitman,"Joints rheumatic, bowels clogged with abomination,"
waltwhitman,"Blood circulating dark and poisonous streams,"
waltwhitman,"Words babble, hearing and touch callous,"
waltwhitman,"No brain, no heart left, no magnetism of sex;"
waltwhitman,"Such from one look in this looking-glass ere you go hence,"
waltwhitman,Such a result so soon--and from such a beginning!
waltwhitman,Gods
waltwhitman,"Lover divine and perfect Comrade,"
waltwhitman,"Waiting content, invisible yet, but certain,"
waltwhitman,Be thou my God.
waltwhitman,"Thou, thou, the Ideal Man,"
waltwhitman,"Fair, able, beautiful, content, and loving,"
waltwhitman,"Complete in body and dilate in spirit,"
waltwhitman,Be thou my God.
waltwhitman,"O Death, (for Life has served its turn,)"
waltwhitman,"Opener and usher to the heavenly mansion,"
waltwhitman,Be thou my God.
waltwhitman,"Aught, aught of mightiest, best I see, conceive, or know,"
waltwhitman,"(To break the stagnant tie--thee, thee to free, O soul,)"
waltwhitman,Be thou my God.
waltwhitman,"All great ideas, the races' aspirations,"
waltwhitman,"All heroisms, deeds of rapt enthusiasts,"
waltwhitman,Be ye my Gods.
waltwhitman,"Or Time and Space,"
waltwhitman,"Or shape of Earth divine and wondrous,"
waltwhitman,"Or some fair shape I viewing, worship,"
waltwhitman,"Or lustrous orb of sun or star by night,"
waltwhitman,Be ye my Gods.
waltwhitman,Germs
waltwhitman,"Forms, qualities, lives, humanity, language, thoughts,"
waltwhitman,"The ones known, and the ones unknown, the ones on the stars,"
waltwhitman,"The stars themselves, some shaped, others unshaped,"
waltwhitman,"Wonders as of those countries, the soil, trees, cities, inhabitants,"
waltwhitman,"whatever they may be,"
waltwhitman,"Splendid suns, the moons and rings, the countless combinations and effects,"
waltwhitman,"Such-like, and as good as such-like, visible here or anywhere, stand"
waltwhitman,"provided for a handful of space, which I extend my arm and"
waltwhitman,"half enclose with my hand,"
waltwhitman,"That containing the start of each and all, the virtue, the germs of all."
waltwhitman,Thoughts
waltwhitman,Of ownership--as if one fit to own things could not at pleasure enter
waltwhitman,"upon all, and incorporate them into himself or herself;"
waltwhitman,"Of vista--suppose some sight in arriere through the formative chaos,"
waltwhitman,"presuming the growth, fulness, life, now attain'd on the journey,"
waltwhitman,"(But I see the road continued, and the journey ever continued;)"
waltwhitman,"Of what was once lacking on earth, and in due time has become"
waltwhitman,"supplied--and of what will yet be supplied,"
waltwhitman,Because all I see and know I believe to have its main purport in
waltwhitman,what will yet be supplied.
waltwhitman,When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer
waltwhitman,"When I heard the learn'd astronomer,"
waltwhitman,"When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,"
waltwhitman,"When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,"
waltwhitman,When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much
waltwhitman,"applause in the lecture-room,"
waltwhitman,"How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,"
waltwhitman,"Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,"
waltwhitman,"In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,"
waltwhitman,Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.
waltwhitman,Perfections
waltwhitman,"Only themselves understand themselves and the like of themselves,"
waltwhitman,As souls only understand souls.
waltwhitman,O Me! O Life!
waltwhitman,"O me! O life! of the questions of these recurring,"
waltwhitman,"Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill'd with the foolish,"
waltwhitman,"Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I,"
waltwhitman,and who more faithless?)
waltwhitman,"Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the"
waltwhitman,"struggle ever renew'd,"
waltwhitman,"Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see"
waltwhitman,"around me,"
waltwhitman,"Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,"
waltwhitman,"The question, O me! so sad, recurring--What good amid these, O me, O life?"
waltwhitman,Answer.
waltwhitman,"That you are here--that life exists and identity,"
waltwhitman,"That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse."
waltwhitman,To a President
waltwhitman,"All you are doing and saying is to America dangled mirages,"
waltwhitman,You have not learn'd of Nature--of the politics of Nature you have
waltwhitman,"not learn'd the great amplitude, rectitude, impartiality,"
waltwhitman,"You have not seen that only such as they are for these States,"
waltwhitman,And that what is less than they must sooner or later lift off from
waltwhitman,these States.
waltwhitman,I Sit and Look Out
waltwhitman,"I sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon all"
waltwhitman,"oppression and shame,"
waltwhitman,I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men at anguish with
waltwhitman,"themselves, remorseful after deeds done,"
waltwhitman,"I see in low life the mother misused by her children, dying,"
waltwhitman,"neglected, gaunt, desperate,"
waltwhitman,"I see the wife misused by her husband, I see the treacherous seducer"
waltwhitman,"of young women,"
waltwhitman,I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love attempted to be
waltwhitman,"hid, I see these sights on the earth,"
waltwhitman,"I see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny, I see martyrs and"
waltwhitman,"prisoners,"
waltwhitman,"I observe a famine at sea, I observe the sailors casting lots who"
waltwhitman,"shall be kill'd to preserve the lives of the rest,"
waltwhitman,I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon
waltwhitman,"laborers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like;"
waltwhitman,"All these--all the meanness and agony without end I sitting look out upon,"
waltwhitman,"See, hear, and am silent."
waltwhitman,To Rich Givers
waltwhitman,"What you give me I cheerfully accept,"
waltwhitman,"A little sustenance, a hut and garden, a little money, as I"
waltwhitman,"rendezvous with my poems,"
waltwhitman,"A traveler's lodging and breakfast as journey through the States,--"
waltwhitman,why should I be ashamed to own such gifts? why to advertise for them?
waltwhitman,"For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman,"
waltwhitman,For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of
waltwhitman,the universe.
waltwhitman,The Dalliance of the Eagles
waltwhitman,"Skirting the river road, (my forenoon walk, my rest,)"
waltwhitman,"Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound, the dalliance of the eagles,"
waltwhitman,"The rushing amorous contact high in space together,"
waltwhitman,"The clinching interlocking claws, a living, fierce, gyrating wheel,"
waltwhitman,"Four beating wings, two beaks, a swirling mass tight grappling,"
waltwhitman,"In tumbling turning clustering loops, straight downward falling,"
waltwhitman,"Till o'er the river pois'd, the twain yet one, a moment's lull,"
waltwhitman,"A motionless still balance in the air, then parting, talons loosing,"
waltwhitman,"Upward again on slow-firm pinions slanting, their separate diverse flight,"
waltwhitman,"She hers, he his, pursuing."
waltwhitman,Roaming in Thought [After reading Hegel]
waltwhitman,"Roaming in thought over the Universe, I saw the little that is Good"
waltwhitman,"steadily hastening towards immortality,"
waltwhitman,And the vast all that is call'd Evil I saw hastening to merge itself
waltwhitman,and become lost and dead.
waltwhitman,A Farm Picture
waltwhitman,"Through the ample open door of the peaceful country barn,"
waltwhitman,"A sunlit pasture field with cattle and horses feeding,"
waltwhitman,"And haze and vista, and the far horizon fading away."
waltwhitman,A Child's Amaze
waltwhitman,"Silent and amazed even when a little boy,"
waltwhitman,"I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his statements,"
waltwhitman,As contending against some being or influence.
waltwhitman,The Runner
waltwhitman,"On a flat road runs the well-train'd runner,"
waltwhitman,"He is lean and sinewy with muscular legs,"
waltwhitman,"He is thinly clothed, he leans forward as he runs,"
waltwhitman,With lightly closed fists and arms partially rais'd.
waltwhitman,Beautiful Women
waltwhitman,"Women sit or move to and fro, some old, some young,"
waltwhitman,The young are beautiful--but the old are more beautiful than the young.
waltwhitman,Mother and Babe
waltwhitman,"I see the sleeping babe nestling the breast of its mother,"
waltwhitman,"The sleeping mother and babe--hush'd, I study them long and long."
waltwhitman,Thought
waltwhitman,"Of obedience, faith, adhesiveness;"
waltwhitman,As I stand aloof and look there is to me something profoundly
waltwhitman,affecting in large masses of men following the lead of those who
waltwhitman,do not believe in men.
waltwhitman,Visor'd
waltwhitman,"A mask, a perpetual natural disguiser of herself,"
waltwhitman,"Concealing her face, concealing her form,"
waltwhitman,"Changes and transformations every hour, every moment,"
waltwhitman,Falling upon her even when she sleeps.
waltwhitman,Thought
waltwhitman,"Of justice--as If could be any thing but the same ample law,"
waltwhitman,"expounded by natural judges and saviors,"
waltwhitman,"As if it might be this thing or that thing, according to decisions."
waltwhitman,Gliding O'er all
waltwhitman,"Gliding o'er all, through all,"
waltwhitman,"Through Nature, Time, and Space,"
waltwhitman,"As a ship on the waters advancing,"
waltwhitman,"The voyage of the soul--not life alone,"
waltwhitman,"Death, many deaths I'll sing."
waltwhitman,Hast Never Come to Thee an Hour
waltwhitman,"Hast never come to thee an hour,"
waltwhitman,"A sudden gleam divine, precipitating, bursting all these bubbles,"
waltwhitman,"fashions, wealth?"
waltwhitman,"These eager business aims--books, politics, art, amours,"
waltwhitman,To utter nothingness?
waltwhitman,Thought
waltwhitman,"Of Equality--as if it harm'd me, giving others the same chances and"
waltwhitman,rights as myself--as if it were not indispensable to my own
waltwhitman,rights that others possess the same.
waltwhitman,To Old Age
waltwhitman,I see in you the estuary that enlarges and spreads itself grandly as
waltwhitman,it pours in the great sea.
waltwhitman,Locations and Times
waltwhitman,"Locations and times--what is it in me that meets them all, whenever"
waltwhitman,"and wherever, and makes me at home?"
waltwhitman,"Forms, colors, densities, odors--what is it in me that corresponds"
waltwhitman,with them?
waltwhitman,Offerings
waltwhitman,"A thousand perfect men and women appear,"
waltwhitman,"Around each gathers a cluster of friends, and gay children and"
waltwhitman,"youths, with offerings."
waltwhitman,"To The States [To Identify the 16th, 17th, or 18th Presidentiad]"
waltwhitman,"Why reclining, interrogating? why myself and all drowsing?"
waltwhitman,"What deepening twilight-scum floating atop of the waters,"
waltwhitman,Who are they as bats and night-dogs askant in the capitol?
waltwhitman,"What a filthy Presidentiad! (O South, your torrid suns! O North,"
waltwhitman,your arctic freezings!)
waltwhitman,Are those really Congressmen? are those the great Judges? is that
waltwhitman,the President?
waltwhitman,"Then I will sleep awhile yet, for I see that these States sleep, for"
waltwhitman,reasons;
waltwhitman,"(With gathering murk, with muttering thunder and lambent shoots we"
waltwhitman,"all duly awake,"
waltwhitman,"South, North, East, West, inland and seaboard, we will surely awake.)"
waltwhitman,BOOK XXI.  DRUM-TAPS
waltwhitman,First O Songs for a Prelude
waltwhitman,"First O songs for a prelude,"
waltwhitman,"Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in my city,"
waltwhitman,"How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,"
waltwhitman,"How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,"
waltwhitman,"(O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!"
waltwhitman,"O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than steel!)"
waltwhitman,How you sprang--how you threw off the costumes of peace with
waltwhitman,"indifferent hand,"
waltwhitman,"How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard"
waltwhitman,"in their stead,"
waltwhitman,"How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of"
waltwhitman,"soldiers,)"
waltwhitman,How Manhattan drum-taps led.
waltwhitman,"Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,"
waltwhitman,"Forty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this teeming and"
waltwhitman,"turbulent city,"
waltwhitman,"Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,"
waltwhitman,"With her million children around her, suddenly,"
waltwhitman,"At dead of night, at news from the south,"
waltwhitman,Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.
waltwhitman,"A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,"
waltwhitman,Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its myriads.
waltwhitman,"From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,"
waltwhitman,"Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming."
waltwhitman,"To the drum-taps prompt,"
waltwhitman,"The young men falling in and arming,"
waltwhitman,"The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's"
waltwhitman,"hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)"
waltwhitman,"The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the court,"
waltwhitman,"The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing"
waltwhitman,"the reins abruptly down on the horses' backs,"
waltwhitman,"The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper, porter, all leaving;"
waltwhitman,"Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,"
waltwhitman,"The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear their"
waltwhitman,"accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,"
waltwhitman,"Outdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musket-barrels,"
waltwhitman,"The white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around, the"
waltwhitman,"sunrise cannon and again at sunset,"
waltwhitman,"Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark"
waltwhitman,"from the wharves,"
waltwhitman,"(How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with"
waltwhitman,their guns on their shoulders!
waltwhitman,"How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and"
waltwhitman,their clothes and knapsacks cover'd with dust!)
waltwhitman,"The blood of the city up-arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,"
waltwhitman,The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the
waltwhitman,"public buildings and stores,"
waltwhitman,"The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his mother,"
waltwhitman,"(Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain him,)"
waltwhitman,"The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the way,"
waltwhitman,"The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their favorites,"
waltwhitman,"The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along,"
waltwhitman,"rumble lightly over the stones,"
waltwhitman,"(Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,"
waltwhitman,Soon unlimber'd to begin the red business;)
waltwhitman,"All the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,"
waltwhitman,"The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,"
waltwhitman,"The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no"
waltwhitman,mere parade now;
waltwhitman,"War! an arm'd race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no turning away!"
waltwhitman,"War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing to"
waltwhitman,welcome it.
waltwhitman,Mannahatta a-march--and it's O to sing it well!
waltwhitman,It's O for a manly life in the camp.
waltwhitman,"And the sturdy artillery,"
waltwhitman,"The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,"
waltwhitman,Unlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salutes for
waltwhitman,"courtesies merely,"
waltwhitman,Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)
waltwhitman,"And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,"
waltwhitman,"Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,"
waltwhitman,Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd amid
waltwhitman,"all your children,"
waltwhitman,But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.
waltwhitman,Eighteen Sixty-One
waltwhitman,"Arm'd year--year of the struggle,"
waltwhitman,"No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year,"
waltwhitman,"Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas piano,"
waltwhitman,"But as a strong man erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing,"
waltwhitman,"carrying rifle on your shoulder,"
waltwhitman,"With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands, with a knife in"
waltwhitman,"the belt at your side,"
waltwhitman,"As I heard you shouting loud, your sonorous voice ringing across the"
waltwhitman,"continent,"
waltwhitman,"Your masculine voice O year, as rising amid the great cities,"
waltwhitman,"Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen, the"
waltwhitman,"dwellers in Manhattan,"
waltwhitman,"Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana,"
waltwhitman,"Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the Allghanies,"
waltwhitman,"Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along"
waltwhitman,"the Ohio river,"
waltwhitman,"Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at"
waltwhitman,"Chattanooga on the mountain top,"
waltwhitman,"Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue, bearing"
waltwhitman,"weapons, robust year,"
waltwhitman,"Heard your determin'd voice launch'd forth again and again,"
waltwhitman,"Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp'd cannon,"
waltwhitman,"I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year."
waltwhitman,Beat! Beat! Drums!
waltwhitman,Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!
waltwhitman,"Through the windows--through doors--burst like a ruthless force,"
waltwhitman,"Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,"
waltwhitman,Into the school where the scholar is studying;
waltwhitman,Leave not the bridegroom quiet--no happiness must he have now with
waltwhitman,"his bride,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering"
waltwhitman,"his grain,"
waltwhitman,So fierce you whirr and pound you drums--so shrill you bugles blow.
waltwhitman,Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!
waltwhitman,Over the traffic of cities--over the rumble of wheels in the streets;
waltwhitman,Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers
waltwhitman,"must sleep in those beds,"
waltwhitman,No bargainers' bargains by day--no brokers or speculators--would
waltwhitman,they continue?
waltwhitman,Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?
waltwhitman,Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?
waltwhitman,"Then rattle quicker, heavier drums--you bugles wilder blow."
waltwhitman,Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!
waltwhitman,"Make no parley--stop for no expostulation,"
waltwhitman,"Mind not the timid--mind not the weeper or prayer,"
waltwhitman,"Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,"
waltwhitman,"Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties,"
waltwhitman,Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the
waltwhitman,"hearses,"
waltwhitman,So strong you thump O terrible drums--so loud you bugles blow.
waltwhitman,From Paumanok Starting I Fly Like a Bird
waltwhitman,"From Paumanok starting I fly like a bird,"
waltwhitman,"Around and around to soar to sing the idea of all,"
waltwhitman,"To the north betaking myself to sing there arctic songs,"
waltwhitman,"To Kanada till I absorb Kanada in myself, to Michigan then,"
waltwhitman,"To Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, to sing their songs, (they are inimitable;)"
waltwhitman,"Then to Ohio and Indiana to sing theirs, to Missouri and Kansas and"
waltwhitman,"Arkansas to sing theirs,"
waltwhitman,"To Tennessee and Kentucky, to the Carolinas and Georgia to sing theirs,"
waltwhitman,"To Texas and so along up toward California, to roam accepted everywhere;"
waltwhitman,"To sing first, (to the tap of the war-drum if need be,)"
waltwhitman,"The idea of all, of the Western world one and inseparable,"
waltwhitman,And then the song of each member of these States.
waltwhitman,Song of the Banner at Daybreak
waltwhitman,Poet:
waltwhitman,"O A new song, a free song,"
waltwhitman,"Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,"
waltwhitman,"By the wind's voice and that of the drum,"
waltwhitman,"By the banner's voice and child's voice and sea's voice and father's voice,"
waltwhitman,"Low on the ground and high in the air,"
waltwhitman,"On the ground where father and child stand,"
waltwhitman,"In the upward air where their eyes turn,"
waltwhitman,Where the banner at daybreak is flapping.
waltwhitman,Words! book-words! what are you?
waltwhitman,"Words no more, for hearken and see,"
waltwhitman,"My song is there in the open air, and I must sing,"
waltwhitman,With the banner and pennant a-flapping.
waltwhitman,"I'll weave the chord and twine in,"
waltwhitman,"Man's desire and babe's desire, I'll twine them in, I'll put in life,"
waltwhitman,"I'll put the bayonet's flashing point, I'll let bullets and slugs whizz,"
waltwhitman,"(As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the future,"
waltwhitman,"Crying with trumpet voice, Arouse and beware! Beware and arouse!)"
waltwhitman,"I'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of joy,"
waltwhitman,"Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,"
waltwhitman,With the banner and pennant a-flapping.
waltwhitman,Pennant:
waltwhitman,"Come up here, bard, bard,"
waltwhitman,"Come up here, soul, soul,"
waltwhitman,"Come up here, dear little child,"
waltwhitman,"To fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the measureless light."
waltwhitman,Child:
waltwhitman,Father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?
waltwhitman,And what does it say to me all the while?
waltwhitman,Father:
waltwhitman,"Nothing my babe you see in the sky,"
waltwhitman,"And nothing at all to you it says--but look you my babe,"
waltwhitman,"Look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the money-"
waltwhitman,"shops opening,"
waltwhitman,And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with goods;
waltwhitman,"These, ah these, how valued and toil'd for these!"
waltwhitman,How envied by all the earth.
waltwhitman,Poet:
waltwhitman,"Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high,"
waltwhitman,"On floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels,"
waltwhitman,"On floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward land,"
waltwhitman,"The great steady wind from west or west-by-south,"
waltwhitman,Floating so buoyant with milk-white foam on the waters.
waltwhitman,"But I am not the sea nor the red sun,"
waltwhitman,"I am not the wind with girlish laughter,"
waltwhitman,"Not the immense wind which strengthens, not the wind which lashes,"
waltwhitman,"Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death,"
waltwhitman,"But I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,"
waltwhitman,"Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,"
waltwhitman,"Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings,"
waltwhitman,"And the shore-sands know and the hissing wave, and that banner and pennant,"
waltwhitman,Aloft there flapping and flapping.
waltwhitman,Child:
waltwhitman,"O father it is alive--it is full of people--it has children,"
waltwhitman,"O now it seems to me it is talking to its children,"
waltwhitman,I hear it--it talks to me--O it is wonderful!
waltwhitman,"O it stretches--it spreads and runs so fast--O my father,"
waltwhitman,It is so broad it covers the whole sky.
waltwhitman,Father:
waltwhitman,"Cease, cease, my foolish babe,"
waltwhitman,"What you are saying is sorrowful to me, much 't displeases me;"
waltwhitman,"Behold with the rest again I say, behold not banners and pennants aloft,"
waltwhitman,"But the well-prepared pavements behold, and mark the solid-wall'd houses."
waltwhitman,Banner and Pennant:
waltwhitman,"Speak to the child O bard out of Manhattan,"
waltwhitman,"To our children all, or north or south of Manhattan,"
waltwhitman,"Point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all--and yet we know"
waltwhitman,"not why,"
waltwhitman,"For what are we, mere strips of cloth profiting nothing,"
waltwhitman,Only flapping in the wind?
waltwhitman,Poet:
waltwhitman,"I hear and see not strips of cloth alone,"
waltwhitman,"I hear the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry,"
waltwhitman,"I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men, I hear Liberty!"
waltwhitman,"I hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing,"
waltwhitman,"I myself move abroad swift-rising flying then,"
waltwhitman,"I use the wings of the land-bird and use the wings of the sea-bird,"
waltwhitman,"and look down as from a height,"
waltwhitman,"I do not deny the precious results of peace, I see populous cities"
waltwhitman,"with wealth incalculable,"
waltwhitman,"I see numberless farms, I see the farmers working in their fields or barns,"
waltwhitman,"I see mechanics working, I see buildings everywhere founded, going"
waltwhitman,"up, or finish'd,"
waltwhitman,I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks drawn by
waltwhitman,"the locomotives,"
waltwhitman,"I see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans,"
waltwhitman,"I see far in the West the immense area of grain, I dwell awhile hovering,"
waltwhitman,"I pass to the lumber forests of the North, and again to the Southern"
waltwhitman,"plantation, and again to California;"
waltwhitman,"Sweeping the whole I see the countless profit, the busy gatherings,"
waltwhitman,"earn'd wages,"
waltwhitman,See the Identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and haughty
waltwhitman,"States, (and many more to come,)"
waltwhitman,"See forts on the shores of harbors, see ships sailing in and out;"
waltwhitman,"Then over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen'd pennant shaped"
waltwhitman,"like a sword,"
waltwhitman,Runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance--and now the halyards
waltwhitman,"have rais'd it,"
waltwhitman,"Side of my banner broad and blue, side of my starry banner,"
waltwhitman,Discarding peace over all the sea and land.
waltwhitman,Banner and Pennant:
waltwhitman,"Yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!"
waltwhitman,"No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone,"
waltwhitman,"We may be terror and carnage, and are so now,"
waltwhitman,"Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States, (nor"
waltwhitman,"any five, nor ten,)"
waltwhitman,"Nor market nor depot we, nor money-bank in the city,"
waltwhitman,"But these and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines"
waltwhitman,"below, are ours,"
waltwhitman,"And the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and small,"
waltwhitman,"And the fields they moisten, and the crops and the fruits are ours,"
waltwhitman,"Bays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ours--while we over all,"
waltwhitman,"Over the area spread below, the three or four millions of square"
waltwhitman,"miles, the capitals,"
waltwhitman,"The forty millions of people,--O bard! in life and death supreme,"
waltwhitman,"We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,"
waltwhitman,"Not for the present alone, for a thousand years chanting through you,"
waltwhitman,This song to the soul of one poor little child.
waltwhitman,Child:
waltwhitman,"O my father I like not the houses,"
waltwhitman,"They will never to me be any thing, nor do I like money,"
waltwhitman,"But to mount up there I would like, O father dear, that banner I like,"
waltwhitman,That pennant I would be and must be.
waltwhitman,Father:
waltwhitman,"Child of mine you fill me with anguish,"
waltwhitman,"To be that pennant would be too fearful,"
waltwhitman,"Little you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever,"
waltwhitman,"It is to gain nothing, but risk and defy every thing,"
waltwhitman,"Forward to stand in front of wars--and O, such wars!--what have you"
waltwhitman,to do with them?
waltwhitman,"With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?"
waltwhitman,Banner:
waltwhitman,"Demons and death then I sing,"
waltwhitman,"Put in all, aye all will I, sword-shaped pennant for war,"
waltwhitman,"And a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of children,"
waltwhitman,"Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid wash of the sea,"
waltwhitman,"And the black ships fighting on the sea envelop'd in smoke,"
waltwhitman,"And the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and pines,"
waltwhitman,"And the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching, and the"
waltwhitman,"hot sun shining south,"
waltwhitman,"And the beach-waves combing over the beach on my Eastern shore,"
waltwhitman,"and my Western shore the same,"
waltwhitman,"And all between those shores, and my ever running Mississippi with"
waltwhitman,"bends and chutes,"
waltwhitman,"And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of Missouri,"
waltwhitman,"The Continent, devoting the whole identity without reserving an atom,"
waltwhitman,"Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all and the yield of all,"
waltwhitman,"Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole,"
waltwhitman,"No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,"
waltwhitman,"But out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no more,"
waltwhitman,Croaking like crows here in the wind.
waltwhitman,Poet:
waltwhitman,"My limbs, my veins dilate, my theme is clear at last,"
waltwhitman,"Banner so broad advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty and resolute,"
waltwhitman,"I burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen'd and blinded,"
waltwhitman,"My hearing and tongue are come to me, (a little child taught me,)"
waltwhitman,"I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand,"
waltwhitman,"Insensate! insensate! (yet I at any rate chant you,) O banner!"
waltwhitman,"Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their"
waltwhitman,"prosperity, (if need be, you shall again have every one of those"
waltwhitman,"houses to destroy them,"
waltwhitman,"You thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast,"
waltwhitman,"full of comfort, built with money,"
waltwhitman,"May they stand fast, then? not an hour except you above them and all"
waltwhitman,stand fast;)
waltwhitman,"O banner, not money so precious are you, not farm produce you, nor"
waltwhitman,"the material good nutriment,"
waltwhitman,"Nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships,"
waltwhitman,"Not the superb ships with sail-power or steam-power, fetching and"
waltwhitman,"carrying cargoes,"
waltwhitman,"Nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues--but you as henceforth"
waltwhitman,"I see you,"
waltwhitman,"Running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars,"
waltwhitman,"(ever-enlarging stars,)"
waltwhitman,"Divider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touch'd by the sun,"
waltwhitman,"measuring the sky,"
waltwhitman,"(Passionately seen and yearn'd for by one poor little child,"
waltwhitman,"While others remain busy or smartly talking, forever teaching"
waltwhitman,"thrift, thrift;)"
waltwhitman,O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake hissing
waltwhitman,"so curious,"
waltwhitman,"Out of reach, an idea only, yet furiously fought for, risking bloody"
waltwhitman,"death, loved by me,"
waltwhitman,So loved--O you banner leading the day with stars brought from the night!
waltwhitman,"Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all--(absolute"
waltwhitman,owner of all)--O banner and pennant!
waltwhitman,"I too leave the rest--great as it is, it is nothing--houses, machines"
waltwhitman,"are nothing--I see them not,"
waltwhitman,"I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes,"
waltwhitman,"sing you only,"
waltwhitman,Flapping up there in the wind.
waltwhitman,Rise O Days from Your Fathomless Deeps
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Rise O days from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier, fiercer sweep,"
waltwhitman,"Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devour'd what the earth gave me,"
waltwhitman,"Long I roam'd amid the woods of the north, long I watch'd Niagara pouring,"
waltwhitman,"I travel'd the prairies over and slept on their breast, I cross'd"
waltwhitman,"the Nevadas, I cross'd the plateaus,"
waltwhitman,"I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail'd out to sea,"
waltwhitman,"I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm,"
waltwhitman,"I watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves,"
waltwhitman,"I mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high, curling over,"
waltwhitman,"I heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds,"
waltwhitman,"Saw from below what arose and mounted, (O superb! O wild as my"
waltwhitman,"heart, and powerful!)"
waltwhitman,"Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow'd after the lightning,"
waltwhitman,Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and
waltwhitman,fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky;
waltwhitman,"These, and such as these, I, elate, saw--saw with wonder, yet pensive"
waltwhitman,"and masterful,"
waltwhitman,"All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,"
waltwhitman,"Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious."
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"'Twas well, O soul--'twas a good preparation you gave me,"
waltwhitman,"Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill,"
waltwhitman,"Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us,"
waltwhitman,"Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities,"
waltwhitman,"Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring,"
waltwhitman,"Torrents of men, (sources and rills of the Northwest are you indeed"
waltwhitman,inexhaustible?)
waltwhitman,"What, to pavements and homesteads here, what were those storms of"
waltwhitman,the mountains and sea?
waltwhitman,"What, to passions I witness around me to-day? was the sea risen?"
waltwhitman,Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?
waltwhitman,"Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage,"
waltwhitman,"Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front--Cincinnati, Chicago,"
waltwhitman,unchain'd;
waltwhitman,"What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here,"
waltwhitman,How it climbs with daring feet and hands--how it dashes!
waltwhitman,How the true thunder bellows after the lightning--how bright the
waltwhitman,flashes of lightning!
waltwhitman,"How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown"
waltwhitman,through the dark by those flashes of lightning!
waltwhitman,"(Yet a mournful wall and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,"
waltwhitman,In a lull of the deafening confusion.)
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!"
waltwhitman,"And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities!"
waltwhitman,"Crash heavier, heavier yet O storms! you have done me good,"
waltwhitman,"My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong nutriment,"
waltwhitman,"Long had I walk'd my cities, my country roads through farms, only"
waltwhitman,"half satisfied,"
waltwhitman,"One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the ground before me,"
waltwhitman,"Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing low;"
waltwhitman,"The cities I loved so well I abandon'd and left, I sped to the"
waltwhitman,"certainties suitable to me,"
waltwhitman,"Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies and Nature's"
waltwhitman,"dauntlessness,"
waltwhitman,"I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only,"
waltwhitman,I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire--on the water and air
waltwhitman,waited long;
waltwhitman,"But now I no longer wait, I am fully satisfied, I am glutted,"
waltwhitman,"I have witness'd the true lightning, I have witness'd my cities electric,"
waltwhitman,"I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise,"
waltwhitman,"Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,"
waltwhitman,No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea.
waltwhitman,Virginia--The West
waltwhitman,"The noble sire fallen on evil days,"
waltwhitman,"I saw with hand uplifted, menacing, brandishing,"
waltwhitman,"(Memories of old in abeyance, love and faith in abeyance,)"
waltwhitman,The insane knife toward the Mother of All.
waltwhitman,"The noble son on sinewy feet advancing,"
waltwhitman,"I saw, out of the land of prairies, land of Ohio's waters and of Indiana,"
waltwhitman,"To the rescue the stalwart giant hurry his plenteous offspring,"
waltwhitman,"Drest in blue, bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders."
waltwhitman,"Then the Mother of All with calm voice speaking,"
waltwhitman,"As to you Rebellious, (I seemed to hear her say,) why strive against"
waltwhitman,"me, and why seek my life?"
waltwhitman,When you yourself forever provide to defend me?
waltwhitman,For you provided me Washington--and now these also.
waltwhitman,City of Ships
waltwhitman,City of ships!
waltwhitman,(O the black ships! O the fierce ships!
waltwhitman,O the beautiful sharp-bow'd steam-ships and sail-ships!)
waltwhitman,"City of the world! (for all races are here,"
waltwhitman,All the lands of the earth make contributions here;)
waltwhitman,City of the sea! city of hurried and glittering tides!
waltwhitman,"City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling in and"
waltwhitman,out with eddies and foam!
waltwhitman,City of wharves and stores--city of tall facades of marble and iron!
waltwhitman,"Proud and passionate city--mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!"
waltwhitman,"Spring up O city--not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself, warlike!"
waltwhitman,Fear not--submit to no models but your own O city!
waltwhitman,Behold me--incarnate me as I have incarnated you!
waltwhitman,"I have rejected nothing you offer'd me--whom you adopted I have adopted,"
waltwhitman,"Good or bad I never question you--I love all--I do not condemn any thing,"
waltwhitman,"I chant and celebrate all that is yours--yet peace no more,"
waltwhitman,"In peace I chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine,"
waltwhitman,"War, red war is my song through your streets, O city!"
waltwhitman,The Centenarian's Story
waltwhitman,"[Volunteer of 1861-2, at Washington Park, Brooklyn, assisting"
waltwhitman,the Centenarian.]
waltwhitman,"Give me your hand old Revolutionary,"
waltwhitman,"The hill-top is nigh, but a few steps, (make room gentlemen,)"
waltwhitman,"Up the path you have follow'd me well, spite of your hundred and"
waltwhitman,"extra years,"
waltwhitman,"You can walk old man, though your eyes are almost done,"
waltwhitman,"Your faculties serve you, and presently I must have them serve me."
waltwhitman,"Rest, while I tell what the crowd around us means,"
waltwhitman,"On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising,"
waltwhitman,"There is the camp, one regiment departs to-morrow,"
waltwhitman,Do you hear the officers giving their orders?
waltwhitman,Do you hear the clank of the muskets?
waltwhitman,Why what comes over you now old man?
waltwhitman,Why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively?
waltwhitman,"The troops are but drilling, they are yet surrounded with smiles,"
waltwhitman,"Around them at hand the well-drest friends and the women,"
waltwhitman,"While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,"
waltwhitman,"Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze,"
waltwhitman,O'er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.
waltwhitman,"But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,"
waltwhitman,Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!
waltwhitman,"As wending the crowds now part and disperse--but we old man,"
waltwhitman,"Not for nothing have I brought you hither--we must remain,"
waltwhitman,"You to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell."
waltwhitman,[The Centenarian]
waltwhitman,"When I clutch'd your hand it was not with terror,"
waltwhitman,"But suddenly pouring about me here on every side,"
waltwhitman,"And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they ran,"
waltwhitman,"And where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see south and south-"
waltwhitman,"east and south-west,"
waltwhitman,"Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,"
waltwhitman,"And along the shores, in mire (now fill'd over) came again and"
waltwhitman,"suddenly raged,"
waltwhitman,"As eighty-five years agone no mere parade receiv'd with applause of friends,"
waltwhitman,"But a battle which I took part in myself--aye, long ago as it is, I"
waltwhitman,"took part in it,"
waltwhitman,"Walking then this hilltop, this same ground."
waltwhitman,"Aye, this is the ground,"
waltwhitman,"My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,"
waltwhitman,"The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,"
waltwhitman,"Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,"
waltwhitman,"I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay,"
waltwhitman,"I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;"
waltwhitman,"Here we lay encamp'd, it was this time in summer also."
waltwhitman,"As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,"
waltwhitman,"It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,"
waltwhitman,"By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held up"
waltwhitman,"his unsheath'd sword,"
waltwhitman,It glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.
waltwhitman,"Twas a bold act then--the English war-ships had just arrived,"
waltwhitman,"We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,"
waltwhitman,And the transports swarming with soldiers.
waltwhitman,"A few days more and they landed, and then the battle."
waltwhitman,"Twenty thousand were brought against us,"
waltwhitman,A veteran force furnish'd with good artillery.
waltwhitman,"I tell not now the whole of the battle,"
waltwhitman,But one brigade early in the forenoon order'd forward to engage the
waltwhitman,"red-coats,"
waltwhitman,"Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,"
waltwhitman,And how long and well it stood confronting death.
waltwhitman,Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?
waltwhitman,"It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,"
waltwhitman,"Rais'd in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally"
waltwhitman,to the General.
waltwhitman,"Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus' waters,"
waltwhitman,"Till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods, gain'd at night,"
waltwhitman,"The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing"
waltwhitman,"their guns,"
waltwhitman,That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's mercy.
waltwhitman,"The General watch'd them from this hill,"
waltwhitman,"They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,"
waltwhitman,"Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle,"
waltwhitman,But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!
waltwhitman,"It sickens me yet, that slaughter!"
waltwhitman,I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.
waltwhitman,I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.
waltwhitman,"Meanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle,"
waltwhitman,But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.
waltwhitman,"We fought the fight in detachments,"
waltwhitman,"Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was"
waltwhitman,"against us,"
waltwhitman,"Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back"
waltwhitman,"to the works on this hill,"
waltwhitman,"Till we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us."
waltwhitman,"That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand"
waltwhitman,"strong,"
waltwhitman,"Few return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn."
waltwhitman,"That and here my General's first battle,"
waltwhitman,"No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude"
waltwhitman,"with applause,"
waltwhitman,Nobody clapp'd hands here then.
waltwhitman,"But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,"
waltwhitman,"Wearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,"
waltwhitman,"While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord off against us encamp'd,"
waltwhitman,"Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over"
waltwhitman,their victory.
waltwhitman,"So dull and damp and another day,"
waltwhitman,"But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,"
waltwhitman,"Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my"
waltwhitman,General retreated.
waltwhitman,"I saw him at the river-side,"
waltwhitman,"Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;"
waltwhitman,"My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over,"
waltwhitman,"And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for"
waltwhitman,the last time.
waltwhitman,"Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,"
waltwhitman,Many no doubt thought of capitulation.
waltwhitman,"But when my General pass'd me,"
waltwhitman,"As he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,"
waltwhitman,I saw something different from capitulation.
waltwhitman,[Terminus]
waltwhitman,"Enough, the Centenarian's story ends,"
waltwhitman,"The two, the past and present, have interchanged,"
waltwhitman,"I myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now speaking."
waltwhitman,And is this the ground Washington trod?
waltwhitman,"And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he cross'd,"
waltwhitman,As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?
waltwhitman,"I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,"
waltwhitman,I must preserve that look as it beam'd on you rivers of Brooklyn.
waltwhitman,"See--as the annual round returns the phantoms return,"
waltwhitman,"It is the 27th of August and the British have landed,"
waltwhitman,"The battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke"
waltwhitman,"Washington's face,"
waltwhitman,The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to intercept
waltwhitman,"the enemy,"
waltwhitman,"They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,"
waltwhitman,"Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,"
waltwhitman,Baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds.
waltwhitman,"In death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears."
waltwhitman,"Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable"
waltwhitman,than your owners supposed;
waltwhitman,"In the midst of you stands an encampment very old,"
waltwhitman,Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade.
waltwhitman,Cavalry Crossing a Ford
waltwhitman,"A line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands,"
waltwhitman,"They take a serpentine course, their arms flash in the sun--hark to"
waltwhitman,"the musical clank,"
waltwhitman,"Behold the silvery river, in it the splashing horses loitering stop"
waltwhitman,"to drink,"
waltwhitman,"Behold the brown-faced men, each group, each person a picture, the"
waltwhitman,"negligent rest on the saddles,"
waltwhitman,"Some emerge on the opposite bank, others are just entering the ford--while,"
waltwhitman,"Scarlet and blue and snowy white,"
waltwhitman,The guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind.
waltwhitman,Bivouac on a Mountain Side
waltwhitman,"I see before me now a traveling army halting,"
waltwhitman,"Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer,"
waltwhitman,"Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising high,"
waltwhitman,"Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily seen,"
waltwhitman,"The numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the"
waltwhitman,"mountain,"
waltwhitman,"The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering,"

waltwhitman,"Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun--the dust-cover'd men,"
waltwhitman,"In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,"
waltwhitman,"With artillery interspers'd--the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,"
waltwhitman,As the army corps advances.
waltwhitman,By the Bivouac's Fitful Flame
waltwhitman,"By the bivouac's fitful flame,"
waltwhitman,"A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow--but"
waltwhitman,"first I note,"
waltwhitman,"The tents of the sleeping army, the fields' and woods' dim outline,"
waltwhitman,"The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire, the silence,"
waltwhitman,"Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving,"
waltwhitman,"The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily"
waltwhitman,"watching me,)"
waltwhitman,"While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts,"
waltwhitman,"Of life and death, of home and the past and loved, and of those that"
waltwhitman,are far away;
waltwhitman,"A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,"
waltwhitman,By the bivouac's fitful flame.
waltwhitman,Come Up from the Fields Father
waltwhitman,"Come up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete,"
waltwhitman,"And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy dear son."
waltwhitman,"Lo, 'tis autumn,"
waltwhitman,"Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,"
waltwhitman,Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the
waltwhitman,"moderate wind,"
waltwhitman,"Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd vines,"
waltwhitman,(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?
waltwhitman,Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)
waltwhitman,"Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and"
waltwhitman,"with wondrous clouds,"
waltwhitman,"Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well."
waltwhitman,"Down in the fields all prospers well,"
waltwhitman,"But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's call."
waltwhitman,"And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away."
waltwhitman,"Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,"
waltwhitman,She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.
waltwhitman,"Open the envelope quickly,"
waltwhitman,"O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,"
waltwhitman,"O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's soul!"
waltwhitman,"All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main"
waltwhitman,"words only,"
waltwhitman,"Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,"
waltwhitman,"taken to hospital,"
waltwhitman,"At present low, but will soon be better."
waltwhitman,"Ah now the single figure to me,"
waltwhitman,"Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,"
waltwhitman,"Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,"
waltwhitman,By the jamb of a door leans.
waltwhitman,"Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through"
waltwhitman,"her sobs,"
waltwhitman,"The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd,)"
waltwhitman,"See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better."
waltwhitman,"Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be"
waltwhitman,"better, that brave and simple soul,)"
waltwhitman,"While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,"
waltwhitman,The only son is dead.
waltwhitman,"But the mother needs to be better,"
waltwhitman,"She with thin form presently drest in black,"
waltwhitman,"By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,"
waltwhitman,"In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,"
waltwhitman,"O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and withdraw,"
waltwhitman,"To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son."
waltwhitman,Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night
waltwhitman,Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;
waltwhitman,"When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,"
waltwhitman,One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look I
waltwhitman,"shall never forget,"
waltwhitman,"One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the ground,"
waltwhitman,"Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,"
waltwhitman,"Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my way,"
waltwhitman,"Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of"
waltwhitman,"responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)"
waltwhitman,"Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the"
waltwhitman,"moderate night-wind,"
waltwhitman,"Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the"
waltwhitman,"battlefield spreading,"
waltwhitman,"Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,"
waltwhitman,"But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,"
waltwhitman,Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my
waltwhitman,"chin in my hands,"
waltwhitman,"Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest"
waltwhitman,"comrade--not a tear, not a word,"
waltwhitman,"Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier,"
waltwhitman,"As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,"
waltwhitman,"Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death,"
waltwhitman,"I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall"
waltwhitman,"surely meet again,)"
waltwhitman,"Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear'd,"
waltwhitman,"My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,"
waltwhitman,"Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and"
waltwhitman,"carefully under feet,"
waltwhitman,"And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his"
waltwhitman,"grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,"
waltwhitman,"Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim,"
waltwhitman,"Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)"
waltwhitman,"Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day"
waltwhitman,"brighten'd,"
waltwhitman,"I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,"
waltwhitman,And buried him where he fell.
waltwhitman,"A March in the Ranks Hard-Prest, and the Road Unknown"
waltwhitman,"A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,"
waltwhitman,"A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,"
waltwhitman,"Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,"
waltwhitman,"Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building,"
waltwhitman,"We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted building,"
waltwhitman,"'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu hospital,"
waltwhitman,Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and
waltwhitman,"poems ever made,"
waltwhitman,"Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,"
waltwhitman,And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and
waltwhitman,"clouds of smoke,"
waltwhitman,"By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some"
waltwhitman,"in the pews laid down,"
waltwhitman,"At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of"
waltwhitman,"bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)"
waltwhitman,"I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as a lily,)"
waltwhitman,"Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it all,"
waltwhitman,"Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,"
waltwhitman,"some of them dead,"
waltwhitman,"Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,"
waltwhitman,"odor of blood,"
waltwhitman,"The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill'd,"
waltwhitman,"Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the"
waltwhitman,"death-spasm sweating,"
waltwhitman,"An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,"
waltwhitman,The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of
waltwhitman,"the torches,"
waltwhitman,"These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,"
waltwhitman,"Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;"
waltwhitman,"But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,"
waltwhitman,"Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,"
waltwhitman,"Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,"
waltwhitman,The unknown road still marching.
waltwhitman,A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim
waltwhitman,"A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,"
waltwhitman,"As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,"
waltwhitman,"As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent,"
waltwhitman,"Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended lying,"
waltwhitman,"Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woolen blanket,"
waltwhitman,"Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all."
waltwhitman,"Curious I halt and silent stand,"
waltwhitman,Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first
waltwhitman,just lift the blanket;
waltwhitman,"Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray'd hair,"
waltwhitman,and flesh all sunken about the eyes?
waltwhitman,Who are you my dear comrade?
waltwhitman,Then to the second I step--and who are you my child and darling?
waltwhitman,Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?
waltwhitman,"Then to the third--a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of"
waltwhitman,beautiful yellow-white ivory;
waltwhitman,Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the
waltwhitman,"Christ himself,"
waltwhitman,"Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies."
waltwhitman,As Toilsome I Wander'd Virginia's Woods
waltwhitman,"As toilsome I wander'd Virginia's woods,"
waltwhitman,"To the music of rustling leaves kick'd by my feet, (for 'twas autumn,)"
waltwhitman,I mark'd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier;
waltwhitman,"Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat, (easily all could"
waltwhitman,"understand,)"
waltwhitman,"The halt of a mid-day hour, when up! no time to lose--yet this sign left,"
waltwhitman,"On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd on the tree by the grave,"
waltwhitman,"Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade."
waltwhitman,"Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering,"
waltwhitman,"Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life,"
waltwhitman,"Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt, alone, or"
waltwhitman,"in the crowded street,"
waltwhitman,"Comes before me the unknown soldier's grave, comes the inscription"
waltwhitman,"rude in Virginia's woods,"
waltwhitman,"Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade."
waltwhitman,Not the Pilot
waltwhitman,"Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port,"
waltwhitman,though beaten back and many times baffled;
waltwhitman,"Not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long,"
waltwhitman,"By deserts parch'd, snows chill'd, rivers wet, perseveres till he"
waltwhitman,"reaches his destination,"
waltwhitman,"More than I have charged myself, heeded or unheeded, to compose"
waltwhitman,"march for these States,"
waltwhitman,"For a battle-call, rousing to arms if need be, years, centuries hence."
waltwhitman,Year That Trembled and Reel'd Beneath Me
waltwhitman,Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me!
waltwhitman,"Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed froze me,"
waltwhitman,"A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me,"
waltwhitman,"Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself,"
waltwhitman,Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?
waltwhitman,And sullen hymns of defeat?
waltwhitman,The Wound-Dresser
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"An old man bending I come among new faces,"
waltwhitman,"Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,"
waltwhitman,"Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,"
waltwhitman,"(Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war,"
waltwhitman,"But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd myself,"
waltwhitman,"To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)"
waltwhitman,"Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,"
waltwhitman,"Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave;)"
waltwhitman,"Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,"
waltwhitman,Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?
waltwhitman,"What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,"
waltwhitman,Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"O maidens and young men I love and that love me,"
waltwhitman,"What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls,"
waltwhitman,"Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and dust,"
waltwhitman,"In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the"
waltwhitman,"rush of successful charge,"
waltwhitman,"Enter the captur'd works--yet lo, like a swift-running river they fade,"
waltwhitman,Pass and are gone they fade--I dwell not on soldiers' perils or
waltwhitman,"soldiers' joys,"
waltwhitman,"(Both I remember well--many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content.)"
waltwhitman,"But in silence, in dreams' projections,"
waltwhitman,"While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,"
waltwhitman,"So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,"
waltwhitman,"With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up there,"
waltwhitman,"Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)"
waltwhitman,"Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,"
waltwhitman,"Straight and swift to my wounded I go,"
waltwhitman,"Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,"
waltwhitman,"Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground,"
waltwhitman,"Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital,"
waltwhitman,"To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,"
waltwhitman,"To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,"
waltwhitman,"An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,"
waltwhitman,"Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill'd again."
waltwhitman,"I onward go, I stop,"
waltwhitman,"With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,"
waltwhitman,"I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,"
waltwhitman,"One turns to me his appealing eyes--poor boy! I never knew you,"
waltwhitman,"Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that"
waltwhitman,would save you.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)"
waltwhitman,"The crush'd head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away,)"
waltwhitman,"The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through examine,"
waltwhitman,"Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life"
waltwhitman,"struggles hard,"
waltwhitman,(Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!
waltwhitman,In mercy come quickly.)
waltwhitman,"From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,"
waltwhitman,"I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood,"
waltwhitman,"Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and side falling head,"
waltwhitman,"His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the"
waltwhitman,"bloody stump,"
waltwhitman,And has not yet look'd on it.
waltwhitman,"I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,"
waltwhitman,"But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,"
waltwhitman,And the yellow-blue countenance see.
waltwhitman,"I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,"
waltwhitman,"Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening,"
waltwhitman,"so offensive,"
waltwhitman,While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.
waltwhitman,"I am faithful, I do not give out,"
waltwhitman,"The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,"
waltwhitman,"These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast"
waltwhitman,"a fire, a burning flame.)"
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"Thus in silence in dreams' projections,"
waltwhitman,"Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,"
waltwhitman,"The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,"
waltwhitman,"I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,"
waltwhitman,"Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,"
waltwhitman,"(Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and rested,"
waltwhitman,Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)
waltwhitman,"Long, Too Long America"
waltwhitman,"Long, too long America,"
waltwhitman,Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn'd from joys and
waltwhitman,"prosperity only,"
waltwhitman,"But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish, advancing,"
waltwhitman,"grappling with direst fate and recoiling not,"
waltwhitman,And now to conceive and show to the world what your children
waltwhitman,"en-masse really are,"
waltwhitman,(For who except myself has yet conceiv'd what your children en-masse
waltwhitman,really are?)
waltwhitman,Give Me the Splendid Silent Sun
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full-dazzling,"
waltwhitman,"Give me autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard,"
waltwhitman,"Give me a field where the unmow'd grass grows,"
waltwhitman,"Give me an arbor, give me the trellis'd grape,"
waltwhitman,"Give me fresh corn and wheat, give me serene-moving animals teaching"
waltwhitman,"content,"
waltwhitman,Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the
waltwhitman,"Mississippi, and I looking up at the stars,"
waltwhitman,Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can
waltwhitman,"walk undisturb'd,"
waltwhitman,"Give me for marriage a sweet-breath'd woman of whom I should never tire,"
waltwhitman,"Give me a perfect child, give me away aside from the noise of the"
waltwhitman,"world a rural domestic life,"
waltwhitman,"Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself, for my own ears only,"
waltwhitman,"Give me solitude, give me Nature, give me again O Nature your primal"
waltwhitman,sanities!
waltwhitman,"These demanding to have them, (tired with ceaseless excitement, and"
waltwhitman,"rack'd by the war-strife,)"
waltwhitman,"These to procure incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,"
waltwhitman,"While yet incessantly asking still I adhere to my city,"
waltwhitman,"Day upon day and year upon year O city, walking your streets,"
waltwhitman,"Where you hold me enchain'd a certain time refusing to give me up,"
waltwhitman,"Yet giving to make me glutted, enrich'd of soul, you give me forever faces;"
waltwhitman,"(O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries,"
waltwhitman,see my own soul trampling down what it ask'd for.)
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Keep your splendid silent sun,"
waltwhitman,"Keep your woods O Nature, and the quiet places by the woods,"
waltwhitman,"Keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your corn-fields and orchards,"
waltwhitman,Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields where the Ninth-month bees hum;
waltwhitman,Give me faces and streets--give me these phantoms incessant and
waltwhitman,endless along the trottoirs!
waltwhitman,Give me interminable eyes--give me women--give me comrades and
waltwhitman,lovers by the thousand!
waltwhitman,Let me see new ones every day--let me hold new ones by the hand every day!
waltwhitman,Give me such shows--give me the streets of Manhattan!
waltwhitman,"Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching--give me the sound of"
waltwhitman,the trumpets and drums!
waltwhitman,"(The soldiers in companies or regiments--some starting away, flush'd"
waltwhitman,"and reckless,"
waltwhitman,"Some, their time up, returning with thinn'd ranks, young, yet very"
waltwhitman,"old, worn, marching, noticing nothing;)"
waltwhitman,Give me the shores and wharves heavy-fringed with black ships!
waltwhitman,"O such for me! O an intense life, full to repletion and varied!"
waltwhitman,"The life of the theatre, bar-room, huge hotel, for me!"
waltwhitman,The saloon of the steamer! the crowded excursion for me! the
waltwhitman,torchlight procession!
waltwhitman,"The dense brigade bound for the war, with high piled military wagons"
waltwhitman,following;
waltwhitman,"People, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants,"
waltwhitman,"Manhattan streets with their powerful throbs, with beating drums as now,"
waltwhitman,"The endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets, (even"
waltwhitman,"the sight of the wounded,)"
waltwhitman,"Manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical chorus!"
waltwhitman,Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me.
waltwhitman,Dirge for Two Veterans
waltwhitman,The last sunbeam
waltwhitman,"Lightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,"
waltwhitman,"On the pavement here, and there beyond it is looking,"
waltwhitman,Down a new-made double grave.
waltwhitman,"Lo, the moon ascending,"
waltwhitman,"Up from the east the silvery round moon,"
waltwhitman,"Beautiful over the house-tops, ghastly, phantom moon,"
waltwhitman,Immense and silent moon.
waltwhitman,"I see a sad procession,"
waltwhitman,"And I hear the sound of coming full-key'd bugles,"
waltwhitman,"All the channels of the city streets they're flooding,"
waltwhitman,As with voices and with tears.
waltwhitman,"I hear the great drums pounding,"
waltwhitman,"And the small drums steady whirring,"
waltwhitman,"And every blow of the great convulsive drums,"
waltwhitman,Strikes me through and through.
waltwhitman,"For the son is brought with the father,"
waltwhitman,"(In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell,"
waltwhitman,"Two veterans son and father dropt together,"
waltwhitman,And the double grave awaits them.)
waltwhitman,"Now nearer blow the bugles,"
waltwhitman,"And the drums strike more convulsive,"
waltwhitman,"And the daylight o'er the pavement quite has faded,"
waltwhitman,And the strong dead-march enwraps me.
waltwhitman,"In the eastern sky up-buoying,"
waltwhitman,"The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin'd,"
waltwhitman,"('Tis some mother's large transparent face,"
waltwhitman,In heaven brighter growing.)
waltwhitman,O strong dead-march you please me!
waltwhitman,O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me!
waltwhitman,O my soldiers twain! O my veterans passing to burial!
waltwhitman,What I have I also give you.
waltwhitman,"The moon gives you light,"
waltwhitman,"And the bugles and the drums give you music,"
waltwhitman,"And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,"
waltwhitman,My heart gives you love.
waltwhitman,Over the Carnage Rose Prophetic a Voice
waltwhitman,"Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice,"
waltwhitman,"Be not dishearten'd, affection shall solve the problems of freedom yet,"
waltwhitman,"Those who love each other shall become invincible,"
waltwhitman,They shall yet make Columbia victorious.
waltwhitman,"Sons of the Mother of All, you shall yet be victorious,"
waltwhitman,You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the earth.
waltwhitman,"No danger shall balk Columbia's lovers,"
waltwhitman,If need be a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one.
waltwhitman,"One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian's comrade,"
waltwhitman,"From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another an Oregonese, shall"
waltwhitman,"be friends triune,"
waltwhitman,More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth.
waltwhitman,"To Michigan, Florida perfumes shall tenderly come,"
waltwhitman,"Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death."
waltwhitman,"It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly affection,"
waltwhitman,"The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly,"
waltwhitman,"The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,"
waltwhitman,The continuance of Equality shall be comrades.
waltwhitman,"These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron,"
waltwhitman,"I, ecstatic, O partners! O lands! with the love of lovers tie you."
waltwhitman,(Were you looking to be held together by lawyers?
waltwhitman,Or by an agreement on a paper? or by arms?
waltwhitman,"Nay, nor the world, nor any living thing, will so cohere.)"
waltwhitman,I Saw Old General at Bay
waltwhitman,"I saw old General at bay,"
waltwhitman,"(Old as he was, his gray eyes yet shone out in battle like stars,)"
waltwhitman,"His small force was now completely hemm'd in, in his works,"
waltwhitman,"He call'd for volunteers to run the enemy's lines, a desperate emergency,"
waltwhitman,"I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks, but two or three"
waltwhitman,"were selected,"
waltwhitman,"I saw them receive their orders aside, they listen'd with care, the"
waltwhitman,"adjutant was very grave,"
waltwhitman,"I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives."
waltwhitman,The Artilleryman's Vision
waltwhitman,"While my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over long,"
waltwhitman,"And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the vacant midnight passes,"
waltwhitman,"And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear, the"
waltwhitman,"breath of my infant,"
waltwhitman,There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me;
waltwhitman,"The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal,"
waltwhitman,"The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear the"
waltwhitman,irregular snap! snap!
waltwhitman,"I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short t-h-t! t-h-t!"
waltwhitman,"of the rifle-balls,"
waltwhitman,"I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear the"
waltwhitman,"great shells shrieking as they pass,"
waltwhitman,"The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees,"
waltwhitman,"(tumultuous now the contest rages,)"
waltwhitman,"All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again,"
waltwhitman,"The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their pieces,"
waltwhitman,The chief-gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of
waltwhitman,"the right time,"
waltwhitman,After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the effect;
waltwhitman,"Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young colonel"
waltwhitman,"leads himself this time with brandish'd sword,)"
waltwhitman,"I see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, (quickly fill'd up, no delay,)"
waltwhitman,"I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover low"
waltwhitman,concealing all;
waltwhitman,"Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either side,"
waltwhitman,"Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls and"
waltwhitman,"orders of officers,"
waltwhitman,While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears
waltwhitman,"a shout of applause, (some special success,)"
waltwhitman,"And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even in"
waltwhitman,dreams a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the
waltwhitman,"depths of my soul,)"
waltwhitman,"And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions, batteries,"
waltwhitman,"cavalry, moving hither and thither,"
waltwhitman,"(The falling, dying, I heed not, the wounded dripping and red"
waltwhitman,"heed not, some to the rear are hobbling,)"
waltwhitman,"Grime, heat, rush, aide-de-camps galloping by or on a full run,"
waltwhitman,"With the patter of small arms, the warning s-s-t of the rifles,"
waltwhitman,"(these in my vision I hear or see,)"
waltwhitman,"And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color'd rockets."
waltwhitman,Ethiopia Saluting the Colors
waltwhitman,"Who are you dusky woman, so ancient hardly human,"
waltwhitman,"With your woolly-white and turban'd head, and bare bony feet?"
waltwhitman,"Why rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?"
waltwhitman,"('Tis while our army lines Carolina's sands and pines,"
waltwhitman,"Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com'st to me,"
waltwhitman,As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea.)
waltwhitman,"Me master years a hundred since from my parents sunder'd,"
waltwhitman,"A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught,"
waltwhitman,Then hither me across the sea the cruel slaver brought.
waltwhitman,"No further does she say, but lingering all the day,"
waltwhitman,"Her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and rolls her darkling eye,"
waltwhitman,"And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving by."
waltwhitman,"What is it fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?"
waltwhitman,"Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red and green?"
waltwhitman,Are the things so strange and marvelous you see or have seen?
waltwhitman,Not Youth Pertains to Me
waltwhitman,"Not youth pertains to me,"
waltwhitman,"Nor delicatesse, I cannot beguile the time with talk,"
waltwhitman,"Awkward in the parlor, neither a dancer nor elegant,"
waltwhitman,"In the learn'd coterie sitting constrain'd and still, for learning"
waltwhitman,"inures not to me,"
waltwhitman,"Beauty, knowledge, inure not to me--yet there are two or three things"
waltwhitman,"inure to me,"
waltwhitman,"I have nourish'd the wounded and sooth'd many a dying soldier,"
waltwhitman,"And at intervals waiting or in the midst of camp,"
waltwhitman,Composed these songs.
waltwhitman,Race of Veterans
waltwhitman,Race of veterans--race of victors!
waltwhitman,"Race of the soil, ready for conflict--race of the conquering march!"
waltwhitman,"(No more credulity's race, abiding-temper'd race,)"
waltwhitman,"Race henceforth owning no law but the law of itself,"
waltwhitman,Race of passion and the storm.
waltwhitman,World Take Good Notice
waltwhitman,"World take good notice, silver stars fading,"
waltwhitman,"Milky hue ript, wet of white detaching,"
waltwhitman,"Coals thirty-eight, baleful and burning,"
waltwhitman,"Scarlet, significant, hands off warning,"
waltwhitman,Now and henceforth flaunt from these shores.
waltwhitman,O Tan-Faced Prairie-Boy
waltwhitman,"O tan-faced prairie-boy,"
waltwhitman,"Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift,"
waltwhitman,"Praises and presents came and nourishing food, till at last among"
waltwhitman,"the recruits,"
waltwhitman,"You came, taciturn, with nothing to give--we but look'd on each other,"
waltwhitman,When lo! more than all the gifts of the world you gave me.
waltwhitman,Look Down Fair Moon
waltwhitman,"Look down fair moon and bathe this scene,"
waltwhitman,"Pour softly down night's nimbus floods on faces ghastly, swollen, purple,"
waltwhitman,"On the dead on their backs with arms toss'd wide,"
waltwhitman,Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon.
waltwhitman,Reconciliation
waltwhitman,"Word over all, beautiful as the sky,"
waltwhitman,Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be
waltwhitman,"utterly lost,"
waltwhitman,That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly
waltwhitman,"wash again, and ever again, this solid world;"
waltwhitman,"For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,"
waltwhitman,"I look where he lies white-faced and still in the coffin--I draw near,"
waltwhitman,Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin.
waltwhitman,"How Solemn As One by One [Washington City, 1865]"
waltwhitman,"How solemn as one by one,"
waltwhitman,"As the ranks returning worn and sweaty, as the men file by where stand,"
waltwhitman,"As the faces the masks appear, as I glance at the faces studying the masks,"
waltwhitman,"(As I glance upward out of this page studying you, dear friend,"
waltwhitman,"whoever you are,)"
waltwhitman,"How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks,"
waltwhitman,"and to you,"
waltwhitman,"I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul,"
waltwhitman,"O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,"
waltwhitman,Nor the bayonet stab what you really are;
waltwhitman,"The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,"
waltwhitman,"Waiting secure and content, which the bullet could never kill,"
waltwhitman,Nor the bayonet stab O friend.
waltwhitman,As I Lay with My Head in Your Lap Camerado
waltwhitman,"As I lay with my head in your lap camerado,"
waltwhitman,"The confession I made I resume, what I said to you and the open air"
waltwhitman,"I resume,"
waltwhitman,"I know I am restless and make others so,"
waltwhitman,"I know my words are weapons full of danger, full of death,"
waltwhitman,"For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to"
waltwhitman,"unsettle them,"
waltwhitman,I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have
waltwhitman,"been had all accepted me,"
waltwhitman,"I heed not and have never heeded either experience, cautions,"
waltwhitman,"majorities, nor ridicule,"
waltwhitman,"And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me,"
waltwhitman,And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing to me;
waltwhitman,"Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and still"
waltwhitman,"urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,"
waltwhitman,"Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and defeated."
waltwhitman,Delicate Cluster
waltwhitman,Delicate cluster! flag of teeming life!
waltwhitman,Covering all my lands--all my seashores lining!
waltwhitman,Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke of battle pressing!
waltwhitman,"How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)"
waltwhitman,"Flag cerulean--sunny flag, with the orbs of night dappled!"
waltwhitman,Ah my silvery beauty--ah my woolly white and crimson!
waltwhitman,"Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty!"
waltwhitman,"My sacred one, my mother."
waltwhitman,To a Certain Civilian
waltwhitman,Did you ask dulcet rhymes from me?
waltwhitman,Did you seek the civilian's peaceful and languishing rhymes?
waltwhitman,Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow?
waltwhitman,"Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to understand--nor"
waltwhitman,am I now;
waltwhitman,"(I have been born of the same as the war was born,"
waltwhitman,"The drum-corps' rattle is ever to me sweet music, I love well the"
waltwhitman,"martial dirge,"
waltwhitman,With slow wail and convulsive throb leading the officer's funeral;)
waltwhitman,"What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I? therefore leave my works,"
waltwhitman,"And go lull yourself with what you can understand, and with piano-tunes,"
waltwhitman,"For I lull nobody, and you will never understand me."
waltwhitman,"Lo, Victress on the Peaks"
waltwhitman,"Lo, Victress on the peaks,"
waltwhitman,"Where thou with mighty brow regarding the world,"
waltwhitman,"(The world O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee,)"
waltwhitman,"Out of its countless beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all,"
waltwhitman,"Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,"
waltwhitman,"Flauntest now unharm'd in immortal soundness and bloom--lo, in"
waltwhitman,"these hours supreme,"
waltwhitman,"No poem proud, I chanting bring to thee, nor mastery's rapturous verse,"
waltwhitman,"But a cluster containing night's darkness and blood-dripping wounds,"
waltwhitman,And psalms of the dead.
waltwhitman,"Spirit Whose Work Is Done [Washington City, 1865]"
waltwhitman,Spirit whose work is done--spirit of dreadful hours!
waltwhitman,Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets;
waltwhitman,"Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever unfaltering"
waltwhitman,"pressing,)"
waltwhitman,"Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene--electric spirit,"
waltwhitman,"That with muttering voice through the war now closed, like a"
waltwhitman,"tireless phantom flitted,"
waltwhitman,"Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the drum,"
waltwhitman,"Now as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,"
waltwhitman,"reverberates round me,"
waltwhitman,"As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles,"
waltwhitman,"As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders,"
waltwhitman,"As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders,"
waltwhitman,"As those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them appearing in the"
waltwhitman,"distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,"
waltwhitman,"Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro to the right and left,"
waltwhitman,Evenly lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time;
waltwhitman,"Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death next day,"
waltwhitman,"Touch my mouth ere you depart, press my lips close,"
waltwhitman,Leave me your pulses of rage--bequeath them to me--fill me with
waltwhitman,"currents convulsive,"
waltwhitman,"Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone,"
waltwhitman,Let them identify you to the future in these songs.
waltwhitman,Adieu to a Soldier
waltwhitman,"Adieu O soldier,"
waltwhitman,"You of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,)"
waltwhitman,"The rapid march, the life of the camp,"
waltwhitman,"The hot contention of opposing fronts, the long manoeuvre,"
waltwhitman,"Red battles with their slaughter, the stimulus, the strong terrific game,"
waltwhitman,"Spell of all brave and manly hearts, the trains of time through you"
waltwhitman,"and like of you all fill'd,"
waltwhitman,With war and war's expression.
waltwhitman,"Adieu dear comrade,"
waltwhitman,"Your mission is fulfill'd--but I, more warlike,"
waltwhitman,"Myself and this contentious soul of mine,"
waltwhitman,"Still on our own campaigning bound,"
waltwhitman,"Through untried roads with ambushes opponents lined,"
waltwhitman,"Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis, often baffled,"
waltwhitman,"Here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out--aye here,"
waltwhitman,"To fiercer, weightier battles give expression."
waltwhitman,Turn O Libertad
waltwhitman,"Turn O Libertad, for the war is over,"
waltwhitman,"From it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no more, resolute,"
waltwhitman,"sweeping the world,"
waltwhitman,"Turn from lands retrospective recording proofs of the past,"
waltwhitman,"From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past,"
waltwhitman,"From the chants of the feudal world, the triumphs of kings, slavery, caste,"
waltwhitman,"Turn to the world, the triumphs reserv'd and to come--give up that"
waltwhitman,"backward world,"
waltwhitman,"Leave to the singers of hitherto, give them the trailing past,"
waltwhitman,"But what remains remains for singers for you--wars to come are for you,"
waltwhitman,"(Lo, how the wars of the past have duly inured to you, and the wars"
waltwhitman,of the present also inure;)
waltwhitman,"Then turn, and be not alarm'd O Libertad--turn your undying face,"
waltwhitman,"To where the future, greater than all the past,"
waltwhitman,"Is swiftly, surely preparing for you."
waltwhitman,To the Leaven'd Soil They Trod
waltwhitman,"To the leaven'd soil they trod calling I sing for the last,"
waltwhitman,"(Forth from my tent emerging for good, loosing, untying the tent-ropes,)"
waltwhitman,"In the freshness the forenoon air, in the far-stretching circuits"
waltwhitman,"and vistas again to peace restored,"
waltwhitman,"To the fiery fields emanative and the endless vistas beyond, to the"
waltwhitman,"South and the North,"
waltwhitman,"To the leaven'd soil of the general Western world to attest my songs,"
waltwhitman,"To the Alleghanian hills and the tireless Mississippi,"
waltwhitman,"To the rocks I calling sing, and all the trees in the woods,"
waltwhitman,"To the plains of the poems of heroes, to the prairies spreading wide,"
waltwhitman,"To the far-off sea and the unseen winds, and the sane impalpable air;"
waltwhitman,"And responding they answer all, (but not in words,)"
waltwhitman,"The average earth, the witness of war and peace, acknowledges mutely,"
waltwhitman,"The prairie draws me close, as the father to bosom broad the son,"
waltwhitman,"The Northern ice and rain that began me nourish me to the end,"
waltwhitman,But the hot sun of the South is to fully ripen my songs.
waltwhitman,BOOK XXII.  MEMORIES OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN
waltwhitman,When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd,"
waltwhitman,"And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the night,"
waltwhitman,"I mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring."
waltwhitman,"Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,"
waltwhitman,"Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,"
waltwhitman,And thought of him I love.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,O powerful western fallen star!
waltwhitman,"O shades of night--O moody, tearful night!"
waltwhitman,O great star disappear'd--O the black murk that hides the star!
waltwhitman,O cruel hands that hold me powerless--O helpless soul of me!
waltwhitman,O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash'd palings,"
waltwhitman,"Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green,"
waltwhitman,"With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I love,"
waltwhitman,"With every leaf a miracle--and from this bush in the dooryard,"
waltwhitman,"With delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green,"
waltwhitman,A sprig with its flower I break.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"In the swamp in secluded recesses,"
waltwhitman,A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.
waltwhitman,"Solitary the thrush,"
waltwhitman,"The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,"
waltwhitman,Sings by himself a song.
waltwhitman,"Song of the bleeding throat,"
waltwhitman,"Death's outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know,"
waltwhitman,If thou wast not granted to sing thou wouldst surely die.)
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,"
waltwhitman,"Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep'd"
waltwhitman,"from the ground, spotting the gray debris,"
waltwhitman,"Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the"
waltwhitman,"endless grass,"
waltwhitman,"Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the"
waltwhitman,"dark-brown fields uprisen,"
waltwhitman,"Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards,"
waltwhitman,"Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,"
waltwhitman,Night and day journeys a coffin.
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,"Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,"
waltwhitman,"Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land,"
waltwhitman,"With the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in black,"
waltwhitman,"With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil'd women standing,"
waltwhitman,"With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night,"
waltwhitman,"With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the"
waltwhitman,"unbared heads,"
waltwhitman,"With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,"
waltwhitman,"With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong"
waltwhitman,"and solemn,"
waltwhitman,"With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the coffin,"
waltwhitman,The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs--where amid these
waltwhitman,"you journey,"
waltwhitman,"With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,"
waltwhitman,"Here, coffin that slowly passes,"
waltwhitman,I give you my sprig of lilac.
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,"(Nor for you, for one alone,"
waltwhitman,"Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring,"
waltwhitman,"For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O sane"
waltwhitman,and sacred death.
waltwhitman,"All over bouquets of roses,"
waltwhitman,"O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies,"
waltwhitman,"But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,"
waltwhitman,"Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,"
waltwhitman,"With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,"
waltwhitman,For you and the coffins all of you O death.)
waltwhitman,8
waltwhitman,"O western orb sailing the heaven,"
waltwhitman,"Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk'd,"
waltwhitman,"As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,"
waltwhitman,"As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,"
waltwhitman,"As you droop'd from the sky low down as if to my side, (while the"
waltwhitman,"other stars all look'd on,)"
waltwhitman,"As we wander'd together the solemn night, (for something I know not"
waltwhitman,"what kept me from sleep,)"
waltwhitman,"As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you"
waltwhitman,"were of woe,"
waltwhitman,"As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night,"
waltwhitman,As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward black
waltwhitman,"of the night,"
waltwhitman,"As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb,"
waltwhitman,"Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone."
waltwhitman,9
waltwhitman,"Sing on there in the swamp,"
waltwhitman,"O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call,"
waltwhitman,"I hear, I come presently, I understand you,"
waltwhitman,"But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd me,"
waltwhitman,The star my departing comrade holds and detains me.
waltwhitman,10
waltwhitman,O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?
waltwhitman,And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?
waltwhitman,And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?
waltwhitman,"Sea-winds blown from east and west,"
waltwhitman,"Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till"
waltwhitman,"there on the prairies meeting,"
waltwhitman,"These and with these and the breath of my chant,"
waltwhitman,I'll perfume the grave of him I love.
waltwhitman,11
waltwhitman,O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?
waltwhitman,"And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,"
waltwhitman,To adorn the burial-house of him I love?
waltwhitman,"Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,"
waltwhitman,"With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,"
waltwhitman,"With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking"
waltwhitman,"sun, burning, expanding the air,"
waltwhitman,"With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves"
waltwhitman,"of the trees prolific,"
waltwhitman,"In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a"
waltwhitman,"wind-dapple here and there,"
waltwhitman,"With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky,"
waltwhitman,"and shadows,"
waltwhitman,"And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,"
waltwhitman,"And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen"
waltwhitman,homeward returning.
waltwhitman,12
waltwhitman,"Lo, body and soul--this land,"
waltwhitman,"My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides,"
waltwhitman,"and the ships,"
waltwhitman,"The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light,"
waltwhitman,"Ohio's shores and flashing Missouri,"
waltwhitman,And ever the far-spreading prairies cover'd with grass and corn.
waltwhitman,"Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,"
waltwhitman,"The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,"
waltwhitman,"The gentle soft-born measureless light,"
waltwhitman,"The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill'd noon,"
waltwhitman,"The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars,"
waltwhitman,"Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land."
waltwhitman,13
waltwhitman,"Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird,"
waltwhitman,"Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes,"
waltwhitman,"Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines."
waltwhitman,"Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,"
waltwhitman,"Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe."
waltwhitman,O liquid and free and tender!
waltwhitman,O wild and loose to my soul--O wondrous singer!
waltwhitman,"You only I hear--yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,)"
waltwhitman,Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.
waltwhitman,14
waltwhitman,"Now while I sat in the day and look'd forth,"
waltwhitman,"In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and"
waltwhitman,"the farmers preparing their crops,"
waltwhitman,"In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests,"
waltwhitman,"In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb'd winds and the storms,)"
waltwhitman,"Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the"
waltwhitman,"voices of children and women,"
waltwhitman,"The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail'd,"
waltwhitman,"And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy"
waltwhitman,"with labor,"
waltwhitman,"And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with"
waltwhitman,"its meals and minutia of daily usages,"
waltwhitman,"And the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities pent--"
waltwhitman,"lo, then and there,"
waltwhitman,"Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,"
waltwhitman,"Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail,"
waltwhitman,"And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death."
waltwhitman,"Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,"
waltwhitman,"And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,"
waltwhitman,"And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of"
waltwhitman,"companions,"
waltwhitman,"I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,"
waltwhitman,"Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,"
waltwhitman,To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.
waltwhitman,"And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me,"
waltwhitman,"The gray-brown bird I know receiv'd us comrades three,"
waltwhitman,"And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love."
waltwhitman,"From deep secluded recesses,"
waltwhitman,"From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,"
waltwhitman,Came the carol of the bird.
waltwhitman,"And the charm of the carol rapt me,"
waltwhitman,"As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,"
waltwhitman,And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.
waltwhitman,"Come lovely and soothing death,"
waltwhitman,"Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,"
waltwhitman,"In the day, in the night, to all, to each,"
waltwhitman,Sooner or later delicate death.
waltwhitman,"Prais'd be the fathomless universe,"
waltwhitman,"For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,"
waltwhitman,"And for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!"
waltwhitman,For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.
waltwhitman,"Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,"
waltwhitman,Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?
waltwhitman,"Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,"
waltwhitman,"I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly."
waltwhitman,"Approach strong deliveress,"
waltwhitman,"When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,"
waltwhitman,"Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,"
waltwhitman,Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death.
waltwhitman,"From me to thee glad serenades,"
waltwhitman,"Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee,"
waltwhitman,"And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread shy are fitting,"
waltwhitman,"And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night."
waltwhitman,"The night in silence under many a star,"
waltwhitman,"The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,"
waltwhitman,"And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil'd death,"
waltwhitman,And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.
waltwhitman,"Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,"
waltwhitman,"Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the"
waltwhitman,"prairies wide,"
waltwhitman,"Over the dense-pack'd cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,"
waltwhitman,"I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death."
waltwhitman,15
waltwhitman,"To the tally of my soul,"
waltwhitman,"Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,"
waltwhitman,With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.
waltwhitman,"Loud in the pines and cedars dim,"
waltwhitman,"Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,"
waltwhitman,And I with my comrades there in the night.
waltwhitman,"While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,"
waltwhitman,As to long panoramas of visions.
waltwhitman,"And I saw askant the armies,"
waltwhitman,"I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,"
waltwhitman,"Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles I saw them,"
waltwhitman,"And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,"
waltwhitman,"And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)"
waltwhitman,And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.
waltwhitman,"I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,"
waltwhitman,"And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,"
waltwhitman,"I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,"
waltwhitman,"But I saw they were not as was thought,"
waltwhitman,"They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,"
waltwhitman,"The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,"
waltwhitman,"And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,"
waltwhitman,And the armies that remain'd suffer'd.
waltwhitman,16
waltwhitman,"Passing the visions, passing the night,"
waltwhitman,"Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,"
waltwhitman,"Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,"
waltwhitman,"Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,"
waltwhitman,"As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,"
waltwhitman,"flooding the night,"
waltwhitman,"Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again"
waltwhitman,"bursting with joy,"
waltwhitman,"Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,"
waltwhitman,"As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,"
waltwhitman,"Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,"
waltwhitman,"I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring."
waltwhitman,"I cease from my song for thee,"
waltwhitman,"From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,"
waltwhitman,O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.
waltwhitman,"Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,"
waltwhitman,"The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,"
waltwhitman,"And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,"

waltwhitman,"For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master."
waltwhitman,"I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth,"
waltwhitman,Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all.
waltwhitman,"I will not be outfaced by irrational things,"
waltwhitman,"I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me,"
waltwhitman,"I will make cities and civilizations defer to me,"
waltwhitman,"This is what I have learnt from America--it is the amount, and it I"
waltwhitman,teach again.
waltwhitman,"(Democracy, while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,"
waltwhitman,"I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children, saw in dreams"
waltwhitman,"your dilating form,"
waltwhitman,Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)

waltwhitman,"I will confront these shows of the day and night,"
waltwhitman,"I will know if I am to be less than they,"
waltwhitman,"I will see if I am not as majestic as they,"
waltwhitman,"I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they,"
waltwhitman,"I will see if I am to be less generous than they,"
waltwhitman,"I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have meaning,"
waltwhitman,"I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,"
waltwhitman,and I am not to be enough for myself.
waltwhitman,"I match my spirit against yours you orbs, growths, mountains, brutes,"
waltwhitman,"Copious as you are I absorb you all in myself, and become the master myself,"
waltwhitman,"America isolated yet embodying all, what is it finally except myself?"
waltwhitman,"These States, what are they except myself?"
waltwhitman,"I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked, it is for my sake,"
waltwhitman,"I take you specially to be mine, you terrible, rude forms."
waltwhitman,"(Mother, bend down, bend close to me your face,"
waltwhitman,"I know not what these plots and wars and deferments are for,"
waltwhitman,"I know not fruition's success, but I know that through war and crime"
waltwhitman,"your work goes on, and must yet go on.)"
waltwhitman,19
waltwhitman,"Thus by blue Ontario's shore,"
waltwhitman,"While the winds fann'd me and the waves came trooping toward me,"
waltwhitman,"I thrill'd with the power's pulsations, and the charm of my theme"
waltwhitman,"was upon me,"
waltwhitman,Till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me.
waltwhitman,"And I saw the free souls of poets,"
waltwhitman,"The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,"
waltwhitman,"Strange large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me."
waltwhitman,20
waltwhitman,"O my rapt verse, my call, mock me not!"
waltwhitman,"Not for the bards of the past, not to invoke them have I launch'd"
waltwhitman,"you forth,"
waltwhitman,"Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores,"
waltwhitman,Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song.
waltwhitman,"Bards for my own land only I invoke,"
waltwhitman,"(For the war the war is over, the field is clear'd,)"
waltwhitman,"Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,"
waltwhitman,To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul.
waltwhitman,Bards of the great Idea! bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the
waltwhitman,"war, the war is over!)"
waltwhitman,"Yet bards of latent armies, a million soldiers waiting ever-ready,"
waltwhitman,Bards with songs as from burning coals or the lightning's fork'd stripes!
waltwhitman,"Ample Ohio's, Kanada's bards--bards of California! inland bards--"
waltwhitman,bards of the war!
waltwhitman,You by my charm I invoke.
waltwhitman,Reversals
waltwhitman,"Let that which stood in front go behind,"
waltwhitman,"Let that which was behind advance to the front,"
waltwhitman,"Let bigots, fools, unclean persons, offer new propositions,"
waltwhitman,"Let the old propositions be postponed,"
waltwhitman,"Let a man seek pleasure everywhere except in himself,"
waltwhitman,Let a woman seek happiness everywhere except in herself
waltwhitman,BOOK XXIV.  AUTUMN RIVULETS
waltwhitman,"As Consequent, Etc."
waltwhitman,"As consequent from store of summer rains,"
waltwhitman,"Or wayward rivulets in autumn flowing,"
waltwhitman,"Or many a herb-lined brook's reticulations,"
waltwhitman,"Or subterranean sea-rills making for the sea,"
waltwhitman,Songs of continued years I sing.
waltwhitman,"Life's ever-modern rapids first, (soon, soon to blend,"
waltwhitman,With the old streams of death.)
waltwhitman,"Some threading Ohio's farm-fields or the woods,"
waltwhitman,"Some down Colorado's canons from sources of perpetual snow,"
waltwhitman,"Some half-hid in Oregon, or away southward in Texas,"
waltwhitman,"Some in the north finding their way to Erie, Niagara, Ottawa,"
waltwhitman,"Some to Atlantica's bays, and so to the great salt brine."
waltwhitman,"In you whoe'er you are my book perusing,"
waltwhitman,"In I myself, in all the world, these currents flowing,"
waltwhitman,"All, all toward the mystic ocean tending."
waltwhitman,"Currents for starting a continent new,"
waltwhitman,"Overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid,"
waltwhitman,"Fusion of ocean and land, tender and pensive waves,"
waltwhitman,"(Not safe and peaceful only, waves rous'd and ominous too,"
waltwhitman,"Out of the depths the storm's abysmic waves, who knows whence?"
waltwhitman,"Raging over the vast, with many a broken spar and tatter'd sail.)"
waltwhitman,"Or from the sea of Time, collecting vasting all, I bring,"
waltwhitman,A windrow-drift of weeds and shells.
waltwhitman,"O little shells, so curious-convolute, so limpid-cold and voiceless,"
waltwhitman,"Will you not little shells to the tympans of temples held,"
waltwhitman,"Murmurs and echoes still call up, eternity's music faint and far,"
waltwhitman,"Wafted inland, sent from Atlantica's rim, strains for the soul of"
waltwhitman,"the prairies,"
waltwhitman,"Whisper'd reverberations, chords for the ear of the West joyously sounding,"
waltwhitman,"Your tidings old, yet ever new and untranslatable,"
waltwhitman,"Infinitesimals out of my life, and many a life,"
waltwhitman,"(For not my life and years alone I give--all, all I give,)"
waltwhitman,"These waifs from the deep, cast high and dry,"
waltwhitman,Wash'd on America's shores?
waltwhitman,The Return of the Heroes
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"For the lands and for these passionate days and for myself,"
waltwhitman,"Now I awhile retire to thee O soil of autumn fields,"
waltwhitman,"Reclining on thy breast, giving myself to thee,"
waltwhitman,"Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart,"
waltwhitman,Turning a verse for thee.
waltwhitman,"O earth that hast no voice, confide to me a voice,"
waltwhitman,"O harvest of my lands--O boundless summer growths,"
waltwhitman,"O lavish brown parturient earth--O infinite teeming womb,"
waltwhitman,A song to narrate thee.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Ever upon this stage,"
waltwhitman,"Is acted God's calm annual drama,"
waltwhitman,"Gorgeous processions, songs of birds,"
waltwhitman,"Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul,"
waltwhitman,"The heaving sea, the waves upon the shore, the musical, strong waves,"
waltwhitman,"The woods, the stalwart trees, the slender, tapering trees,"
waltwhitman,"The liliput countless armies of the grass,"
waltwhitman,"The heat, the showers, the measureless pasturages,"
waltwhitman,"The scenery of the snows, the winds' free orchestra,"
waltwhitman,"The stretching light-hung roof of clouds, the clear cerulean and the"
waltwhitman,"silvery fringes,"
waltwhitman,"The high-dilating stars, the placid beckoning stars,"
waltwhitman,"The moving flocks and herds, the plains and emerald meadows,"
waltwhitman,The shows of all the varied lands and all the growths and products.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"Fecund America--today,"
waltwhitman,Thou art all over set in births and joys!
waltwhitman,"Thou groan'st with riches, thy wealth clothes thee as a swathing-garment,"
waltwhitman,"Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions,"
waltwhitman,"A myriad-twining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast demesne,"
waltwhitman,"As some huge ship freighted to water's edge thou ridest into port,"
waltwhitman,"As rain falls from the heaven and vapors rise from earth, so have"
waltwhitman,the precious values fallen upon thee and risen out of thee;
waltwhitman,Thou envy of the globe! thou miracle!
waltwhitman,"Thou, bathed, choked, swimming in plenty,"
waltwhitman,"Thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns,"
waltwhitman,Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon
waltwhitman,"thy world, and lookest East and lookest West,"
waltwhitman,"Dispensatress, that by a word givest a thousand miles, a million"
waltwhitman,"farms, and missest nothing,"
waltwhitman,"Thou all-acceptress--thou hospitable, (thou only art hospitable as"
waltwhitman,God is hospitable.)
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"When late I sang sad was my voice,"
waltwhitman,Sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred and
waltwhitman,smoke of war;
waltwhitman,"In the midst of the conflict, the heroes, I stood,"
waltwhitman,Or pass'd with slow step through the wounded and dying.
waltwhitman,"But now I sing not war,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the measur'd march of soldiers, nor the tents of camps,"
waltwhitman,Nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle;
waltwhitman,"No more the sad, unnatural shows of war."
waltwhitman,"Ask'd room those flush'd immortal ranks, the first forth-stepping armies?"
waltwhitman,"Ask room alas the ghastly ranks, the armies dread that follow'd."
waltwhitman,"(Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, with your tramping sinewy legs,"
waltwhitman,"With your shoulders young and strong, with your knapsacks and your muskets;"
waltwhitman,"How elate I stood and watch'd you, where starting off you march'd."
waltwhitman,"Pass--then rattle drums again,"
waltwhitman,"For an army heaves in sight, O another gathering army,"
waltwhitman,"Swarming, trailing on the rear, O you dread accruing army,"
waltwhitman,"O you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea, with your fever,"
waltwhitman,"O my land's maim'd darlings, with the plenteous bloody bandage and"
waltwhitman,"the crutch,"
waltwhitman,"Lo, your pallid army follows.)"
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"But on these days of brightness,"
waltwhitman,"On the far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes the"
waltwhitman,"high-piled farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns,"
waltwhitman,Should the dead intrude?
waltwhitman,"Ah the dead to me mar not, they fit well in Nature,"
waltwhitman,"They fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass,"
waltwhitman,And along the edge of the sky in the horizon's far margin.
waltwhitman,"Nor do I forget you Departed,"
waltwhitman,"Nor in winter or summer my lost ones,"
waltwhitman,"But most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at peace,"
waltwhitman,"like pleasing phantoms,"
waltwhitman,Your memories rising glide silently by me.
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,"I saw the day the return of the heroes,"
waltwhitman,"(Yet the heroes never surpass'd shall never return,"
waltwhitman,Them that day I saw not.)
waltwhitman,"I saw the interminable corps, I saw the processions of armies,"
waltwhitman,"I saw them approaching, defiling by with divisions,"
waltwhitman,"Streaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters of"
waltwhitman,mighty camps.
waltwhitman,"No holiday soldiers--youthful, yet veterans,"
waltwhitman,"Worn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and workshop,"
waltwhitman,"Harden'd of many a long campaign and sweaty march,"
waltwhitman,Inured on many a hard-fought bloody field.
waltwhitman,"A pause--the armies wait,"
waltwhitman,"A million flush'd embattled conquerors wait,"
waltwhitman,"The world too waits, then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn,"
waltwhitman,"They melt, they disappear."
waltwhitman,Exult O lands! victorious lands!
waltwhitman,"Not there your victory on those red shuddering fields,"
waltwhitman,But here and hence your victory.
waltwhitman,"Melt, melt away ye armies--disperse ye blue-clad soldiers,"
waltwhitman,"Resolve ye back again, give up for good your deadly arms,"
waltwhitman,"Other the arms the fields henceforth for you, or South or North,"
waltwhitman,"With saner wars, sweet wars, life-giving wars."
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,"Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!"
waltwhitman,"The season of thanks and the voice of full-yielding,"
waltwhitman,The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.
waltwhitman,"All till'd and untill'd fields expand before me,"
waltwhitman,"I see the true arenas of my race, or first or last,"
waltwhitman,Man's innocent and strong arenas.
waltwhitman,"I see the heroes at other toils,"
waltwhitman,I see well-wielded in their hands the better weapons.
waltwhitman,"I see where the Mother of All,"
waltwhitman,"With full-spanning eye gazes forth, dwells long,"
waltwhitman,And counts the varied gathering of the products.
waltwhitman,"Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,"
waltwhitman,"Prairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the North,"
waltwhitman,"Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane,"
waltwhitman,"Open unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,"
waltwhitman,"Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,"
waltwhitman,"And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook,"
waltwhitman,"And healthy uplands with herby-perfumed breezes,"
waltwhitman,"And the good green grass, that delicate miracle the ever-recurring grass."
waltwhitman,8
waltwhitman,Toil on heroes! harvest the products!
waltwhitman,"Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All,"
waltwhitman,With dilated form and lambent eyes watch'd you.
waltwhitman,Toil on heroes! toil well! handle the weapons well!
waltwhitman,"The Mother of All, yet here as ever she watches you."
waltwhitman,"Well-pleased America thou beholdest,"
waltwhitman,"Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters,"
waltwhitman,"The human-divine inventions, the labor-saving implements;"
waltwhitman,Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the
waltwhitman,"revolving hay-rakes,"
waltwhitman,The steam-power reaping-machines and the horse-power machines
waltwhitman,"The engines, thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain, well"
waltwhitman,"separating the straw, the nimble work of the patent pitchfork,"
waltwhitman,"Beholdest the newer saw-mill, the southern cotton-gin, and the"
waltwhitman,rice-cleanser.
waltwhitman,"Beneath thy look O Maternal,"
waltwhitman,With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes harvest.
waltwhitman,"All gather and all harvest,"
waltwhitman,"Yet but for thee O Powerful, not a scythe might swing as now in security,"
waltwhitman,Not a maize-stalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace.
waltwhitman,"Under thee only they harvest, even but a wisp of hay under thy great"
waltwhitman,"face only,"
waltwhitman,"Harvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, every barbed spear"
waltwhitman,"under thee,"
waltwhitman,"Harvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, each ear in its"
waltwhitman,"light-green sheath,"
waltwhitman,"Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns,"
waltwhitman,"Oats to their bins, the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, to theirs;"
waltwhitman,"Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama, dig and hoard the"
waltwhitman,"golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,"
waltwhitman,"Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,"
waltwhitman,"Cut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp or tobacco in the Borders,"
waltwhitman,"Pick the pea and the bean, or pull apples from the trees or bunches"
waltwhitman,"of grapes from the vines,"
waltwhitman,"Or aught that ripens in all these States or North or South,"
waltwhitman,Under the beaming sun and under thee.
waltwhitman,There Was a Child Went Forth
waltwhitman,"There was a child went forth every day,"
waltwhitman,"And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became,"
waltwhitman,"And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day,"
waltwhitman,Or for many years or stretching cycles of years.
waltwhitman,"The early lilacs became part of this child,"
waltwhitman,"And grass and white and red morning-glories, and white and red"
waltwhitman,"clover, and the song of the phoebe-bird,"
waltwhitman,"And the Third-month lambs and the sow's pink-faint litter, and the"
waltwhitman,"mare's foal and the cow's calf,"
waltwhitman,"And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond-side,"
waltwhitman,"And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there, and the"
waltwhitman,"beautiful curious liquid,"
waltwhitman,"And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads, all became part of him."
waltwhitman,"The field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month became part of him,"
waltwhitman,"Winter-grain sprouts and those of the light-yellow corn, and the"
waltwhitman,"esculent roots of the garden,"
waltwhitman,"And the apple-trees cover'd with blossoms and the fruit afterward,"
waltwhitman,"and wood-berries, and the commonest weeds by the road,"
waltwhitman,And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the
waltwhitman,"tavern whence he had lately risen,"
waltwhitman,"And the schoolmistress that pass'd on her way to the school,"
waltwhitman,"And the friendly boys that pass'd, and the quarrelsome boys,"
waltwhitman,"And the tidy and fresh-cheek'd girls, and the barefoot negro boy and girl,"
waltwhitman,And all the changes of city and country wherever he went.
waltwhitman,"His own parents, he that had father'd him and she that had conceiv'd"
waltwhitman,"him in her womb and birth'd him,"
waltwhitman,"They gave this child more of themselves than that,"
waltwhitman,"They gave him afterward every day, they became part of him."
waltwhitman,"The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table,"
waltwhitman,"The mother with mild words, clean her cap and gown, a wholesome"
waltwhitman,"odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by,"
waltwhitman,"The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger'd, unjust,"
waltwhitman,"The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,"
waltwhitman,"The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture, the"
waltwhitman,"yearning and swelling heart,"
waltwhitman,"Affection that will not be gainsay'd, the sense of what is real, the"
waltwhitman,"thought if after all it should prove unreal,"
waltwhitman,"The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time, the curious"
waltwhitman,"whether and how,"
waltwhitman,"Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?"
waltwhitman,"Men and women crowding fast in the streets, if they are not flashes"
waltwhitman,and specks what are they?
waltwhitman,"The streets themselves and the facades of houses, and goods in the windows,"
waltwhitman,"Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank'd wharves, the huge crossing at"
waltwhitman,"the ferries,"
waltwhitman,"The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset, the river between,"
waltwhitman,"Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of"
waltwhitman,"white or brown two miles off,"
waltwhitman,"The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide, the little"
waltwhitman,"boat slack-tow'd astern,"
waltwhitman,"The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,"
waltwhitman,"The strata of color'd clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint away"
waltwhitman,"solitary by itself, the spread of purity it lies motionless in,"
waltwhitman,"The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh"
waltwhitman,"and shore mud,"
waltwhitman,"These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who"
waltwhitman,"now goes, and will always go forth every day."
waltwhitman,Old Ireland
waltwhitman,"Far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty,"
waltwhitman,"Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother,"
waltwhitman,"Once a queen, now lean and tatter'd seated on the ground,"
waltwhitman,"Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders,"
waltwhitman,"At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,"
waltwhitman,"Long silent, she too long silent, mourning her shrouded hope and heir,"
waltwhitman,Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of love.
waltwhitman,"Yet a word ancient mother,"
waltwhitman,You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with forehead
waltwhitman,"between your knees,"
waltwhitman,"O you need not sit there veil'd in your old white hair so dishevel'd,"
waltwhitman,"For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave,"
waltwhitman,"It was an illusion, the son you love was not really dead,"
waltwhitman,"The Lord is not dead, he is risen again young and strong in another country,"
waltwhitman,"Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave,"
waltwhitman,"What you wept for was translated, pass'd from the grave,"
waltwhitman,"The winds favor'd and the sea sail'd it,"
waltwhitman,"And now with rosy and new blood,"
waltwhitman,Moves to-day in a new country.
waltwhitman,The City Dead-House
waltwhitman,"By the city dead-house by the gate,"
waltwhitman,"As idly sauntering wending my way from the clangor,"
waltwhitman,"I curious pause, for lo, an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute brought,"
waltwhitman,"Her corpse they deposit unclaim'd, it lies on the damp brick pavement,"
waltwhitman,"The divine woman, her body, I see the body, I look on it alone,"
waltwhitman,"That house once full of passion and beauty, all else I notice not,"
waltwhitman,"Nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odors"
waltwhitman,"morbific impress me,"
waltwhitman,But the house alone--that wondrous house--that delicate fair house
waltwhitman,--that ruin!
waltwhitman,That immortal house more than all the rows of dwellings ever built!
waltwhitman,"Or white-domed capitol with majestic figure surmounted, or all the"
waltwhitman,"old high-spired cathedrals,"
waltwhitman,"That little house alone more than them all--poor, desperate house!"
waltwhitman,"Fair, fearful wreck--tenement of a soul--itself a soul,"
waltwhitman,"Unclaim'd, avoided house--take one breath from my tremulous lips,"
waltwhitman,"Take one tear dropt aside as I go for thought of you,"
waltwhitman,"Dead house of love--house of madness and sin, crumbled, crush'd,"
waltwhitman,"House of life, erewhile talking and laughing--but ah, poor house,"
waltwhitman,"dead even then,"
waltwhitman,"Months, years, an echoing, garnish'd house--but dead, dead, dead."
waltwhitman,This Compost
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Something startles me where I thought I was safest,"
waltwhitman,"I withdraw from the still woods I loved,"
waltwhitman,"I will not go now on the pastures to walk,"
waltwhitman,"I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea,"
waltwhitman,I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me.
waltwhitman,O how can it be that the ground itself does not sicken?
waltwhitman,How can you be alive you growths of spring?
waltwhitman,"How can you furnish health you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?"
waltwhitman,Are they not continually putting distemper'd corpses within you?
waltwhitman,Is not every continent work'd over and over with sour dead?
waltwhitman,Where have you disposed of their carcasses?
waltwhitman,Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations?
waltwhitman,Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?
waltwhitman,"I do not see any of it upon you to-day, or perhaps I am deceiv'd,"
waltwhitman,"I will run a furrow with my plough, I will press my spade through"
waltwhitman,"the sod and turn it up underneath,"
waltwhitman,I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,Behold this compost! behold it well!
waltwhitman,Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick person--yet behold!
waltwhitman,"The grass of spring covers the prairies,"
waltwhitman,"The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,"
waltwhitman,"The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,"
waltwhitman,"The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,"
waltwhitman,"The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,"
waltwhitman,"The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree,"
waltwhitman,The he-birds carol mornings and evenings while the she-birds sit on
waltwhitman,"their nests,"
waltwhitman,"The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs,"
waltwhitman,"The new-born of animals appear, the calf is dropt from the cow, the"
waltwhitman,"colt from the mare,"
waltwhitman,"Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's dark green leaves,"
waltwhitman,"Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk, the lilacs bloom in"
waltwhitman,"the dooryards,"
waltwhitman,The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata
waltwhitman,of sour dead.
waltwhitman,What chemistry!
waltwhitman,"That the winds are really not infectious,"
waltwhitman,"That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea which"
waltwhitman,"is so amorous after me,"
waltwhitman,"That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its tongues,"
waltwhitman,That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited
waltwhitman,"themselves in it,"
waltwhitman,"That all is clean forever and forever,"
waltwhitman,"That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,"
waltwhitman,"That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,"
waltwhitman,"That the fruits of the apple-orchard and the orange-orchard, that"
waltwhitman,"melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,"
waltwhitman,"That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease,"
waltwhitman,Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once
waltwhitman,catching disease.
waltwhitman,"Now I am terrified at the Earth, it is that calm and patient,"
waltwhitman,"It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,"
waltwhitman,"It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless"
waltwhitman,"successions of diseas'd corpses,"
waltwhitman,"It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,"
waltwhitman,"It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,"
waltwhitman,"It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings"
waltwhitman,from them at last.
waltwhitman,To a Foil'd European Revolutionaire
waltwhitman,"Courage yet, my brother or my sister!"
waltwhitman,Keep on--Liberty is to be subserv'd whatever occurs;
waltwhitman,"That is nothing that is quell'd by one or two failures, or any"
waltwhitman,"number of failures,"
waltwhitman,"Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any"
waltwhitman,"unfaithfulness,"
waltwhitman,"Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes."
waltwhitman,"What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents,"
waltwhitman,"Invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and light, is"
waltwhitman,"positive and composed, knows no discouragement,"
waltwhitman,"Waiting patiently, waiting its time."
waltwhitman,"(Not songs of loyalty alone are these,"
waltwhitman,"But songs of insurrection also,"
waltwhitman,"For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over,"
waltwhitman,"And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him,"
waltwhitman,And stakes his life to be lost at any moment.)
waltwhitman,"The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance and retreat,"
waltwhitman,"The infidel triumphs, or supposes he triumphs,"
waltwhitman,"The prison, scaffold, garrote, handcuffs, iron necklace and"
waltwhitman,"leadballs do their work,"
waltwhitman,"The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,"
waltwhitman,"The great speakers and writers are exiled, they lie sick in distant lands,"
waltwhitman,"The cause is asleep, the strongest throats are choked with their own blood,"
waltwhitman,The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet;
waltwhitman,"But for all this Liberty has not gone out of the place, nor the"
waltwhitman,infidel enter'd into full possession.
waltwhitman,"When liberty goes out of a place it is not the first to go, nor the"
waltwhitman,"second or third to go,"
waltwhitman,"It waits for all the rest to go, it is the last."
waltwhitman,"When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,"
waltwhitman,And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged
waltwhitman,"from any part of the earth,"
waltwhitman,Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from
waltwhitman,"that part of the earth,"
waltwhitman,And the infidel come into full possession.
waltwhitman,"Then courage European revolter, revoltress!"
waltwhitman,For till all ceases neither must you cease.
waltwhitman,"I do not know what you are for, (I do not know what I am for myself,"
waltwhitman,"nor what any thing is for,)"
waltwhitman,"But I will search carefully for it even in being foil'd,"
waltwhitman,"In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment--for they too are great."
waltwhitman,Did we think victory great?
waltwhitman,"So it is--but now it seems to me, when it cannot be help'd, that"
waltwhitman,"defeat is great,"
waltwhitman,And that death and dismay are great.
waltwhitman,Unnamed Land
waltwhitman,"Nations ten thousand years before these States, and many times ten"
waltwhitman,"thousand years before these States,"
waltwhitman,Garner'd clusters of ages that men and women like us grew up and
waltwhitman,"travel'd their course and pass'd on,"
waltwhitman,"What vast-built cities, what orderly republics, what pastoral tribes"
waltwhitman,"and nomads,"
waltwhitman,"What histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others,"
waltwhitman,"What laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions,"
waltwhitman,"What sort of marriage, what costumes, what physiology and phrenology,"
waltwhitman,"What of liberty and slavery among them, what they thought of death"
waltwhitman,"and the soul,"
waltwhitman,"Who were witty and wise, who beautiful and poetic, who brutish and"
waltwhitman,"undevelop'd,"
waltwhitman,"Not a mark, not a record remains--and yet all remains."
waltwhitman,"O I know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more"
waltwhitman,"than we are for nothing,"
waltwhitman,I know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much
waltwhitman,as we now belong to it.
waltwhitman,"Afar they stand, yet near to me they stand,"
waltwhitman,"Some with oval countenances learn'd and calm,"
waltwhitman,"Some naked and savage, some like huge collections of insects,"
waltwhitman,"Some in tents, herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,"
waltwhitman,"Some prowling through woods, some living peaceably on farms,"
waltwhitman,"laboring, reaping, filling barns,"
waltwhitman,"Some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories,"
waltwhitman,"libraries, shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments."
waltwhitman,Are those billions of men really gone?
waltwhitman,Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone?
waltwhitman,"Do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?"
waltwhitman,Did they achieve nothing for good for themselves?
waltwhitman,"I believe of all those men and women that fill'd the unnamed lands,"
waltwhitman,"every one exists this hour here or elsewhere, invisible to us."
waltwhitman,"In exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and out of"
waltwhitman,"what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinn'd, in life."
waltwhitman,I believe that was not the end of those nations or any person of
waltwhitman,"them, any more than this shall be the end of my nation, or of me;"
waltwhitman,"Of their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products,"
waltwhitman,"games, wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets,"
waltwhitman,"I suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen world,"
waltwhitman,"counterparts of what accrued to them in the seen world,"
waltwhitman,"I suspect I shall meet them there,"
waltwhitman,I suspect I shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands.
waltwhitman,Song of Prudence
waltwhitman,"Manhattan's streets I saunter'd pondering,"
waltwhitman,"On Time, Space, Reality--on such as these, and abreast with them Prudence."
waltwhitman,"The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence,"
waltwhitman,Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that
waltwhitman,suits immortality.
waltwhitman,"The soul is of itself,"
waltwhitman,"All verges to it, all has reference to what ensues,"
waltwhitman,"All that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence,"
waltwhitman,"Not a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day,"
waltwhitman,"month, any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death,"
waltwhitman,But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the
waltwhitman,indirect lifetime.
waltwhitman,"The indirect is just as much as the direct,"
waltwhitman,The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the
waltwhitman,"body, if not more."
waltwhitman,"Not one word or deed, not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of"
waltwhitman,"the onanist,"
waltwhitman,"Putridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning,"
waltwhitman,"betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution,"
waltwhitman,But has results beyond death as really as before death.
waltwhitman,Charity and personal force are the only investments worth any thing.
waltwhitman,"No specification is necessary, all that a male or female does, that"
waltwhitman,"is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or her,"
waltwhitman,In the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope
waltwhitman,of it forever.
waltwhitman,"Who has been wise receives interest,"
waltwhitman,"Savage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat,"
waltwhitman,"young, old, it is the same,"
waltwhitman,The interest will come round--all will come round.
waltwhitman,"Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect,"
waltwhitman,"all of the past and all of the present and all of the future,"
waltwhitman,"All the brave actions of war and peace,"
waltwhitman,"All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful,"
waltwhitman,"young children, widows, the sick, and to shunn'd persons,"
waltwhitman,"All self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw"
waltwhitman,"others fill the seats of the boats,"
waltwhitman,"All offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a"
waltwhitman,"friend's sake, or opinion's sake,"
waltwhitman,"All pains of enthusiasts scoff'd at by their neighbors,"
waltwhitman,"All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,"
waltwhitman,"All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,"
waltwhitman,"All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit,"
waltwhitman,"All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name,"
waltwhitman,"date, location,"
waltwhitman,"All that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no,"
waltwhitman,All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his
waltwhitman,"mouth, or the shaping of his great hands,"
waltwhitman,"All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe,"
waltwhitman,"or on any of the wandering stars, or on any of the fix'd stars,"
waltwhitman,"by those there as we are here,"
waltwhitman,"All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you are,"
waltwhitman,"or by any one,"
waltwhitman,"These inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities from which"
waltwhitman,"they sprang, or shall spring."
waltwhitman,Did you guess any thing lived only its moment?
waltwhitman,"The world does not so exist, no parts palpable or impalpable so exist,"
waltwhitman,No consummation exists without being from some long previous
waltwhitman,"consummation, and that from some other,"
waltwhitman,Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the
waltwhitman,beginning than any.
waltwhitman,Whatever satisfies souls is true;
waltwhitman,"Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls,"
waltwhitman,"Itself only finally satisfies the soul,"
waltwhitman,The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson
waltwhitman,but its own.
waltwhitman,"Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time,"
waltwhitman,"space, reality,"
waltwhitman,That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.
waltwhitman,"What is prudence is indivisible,"
waltwhitman,"Declines to separate one part of life from every part,"
waltwhitman,"Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead,"
waltwhitman,"Matches every thought or act by its correlative,"
waltwhitman,"Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement,"
waltwhitman,Knows that the young man who composedly peril'd his life and lost it
waltwhitman,"has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt,"
waltwhitman,"That he who never peril'd his life, but retains it to old age in"
waltwhitman,"riches and ease, has probably achiev'd nothing for himself worth"
waltwhitman,"mentioning,"
waltwhitman,Knows that only that person has really learn'd who has learn'd to
waltwhitman,"prefer results,"
waltwhitman,"Who favors body and soul the same,"
waltwhitman,"Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,"
waltwhitman,Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor
waltwhitman,avoids death.
waltwhitman,The Singer in the Prison
waltwhitman,"O sight of pity, shame and dole!"
waltwhitman,O fearful thought--a convict soul.
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Rang the refrain along the hall, the prison,"
waltwhitman,"Rose to the roof, the vaults of heaven above,"
waltwhitman,Pouring in floods of melody in tones so pensive sweet and strong the
waltwhitman,"like whereof was never heard,"
waltwhitman,"Reaching the far-off sentry and the armed guards, who ceas'd their pacing,"
waltwhitman,Making the hearer's pulses stop for ecstasy and awe.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"The sun was low in the west one winter day,"
waltwhitman,"When down a narrow aisle amid the thieves and outlaws of the land,"
waltwhitman,"(There by the hundreds seated, sear-faced murderers, wily counterfeiters,"
waltwhitman,"Gather'd to Sunday church in prison walls, the keepers round,"
waltwhitman,"Plenteous, well-armed, watching with vigilant eyes,)"
waltwhitman,"Calmly a lady walk'd holding a little innocent child by either hand,"
waltwhitman,"Whom seating on their stools beside her on the platform,"
waltwhitman,"She, first preluding with the instrument a low and musical prelude,"
waltwhitman,"In voice surpassing all, sang forth a quaint old hymn."
waltwhitman,"A soul confined by bars and bands,"
waltwhitman,"Cries, help! O help! and wrings her hands,"
waltwhitman,"Blinded her eyes, bleeding her breast,"
waltwhitman,"Nor pardon finds, nor balm of rest."
waltwhitman,"Ceaseless she paces to and fro,"
waltwhitman,O heart-sick days! O nights of woe!
waltwhitman,"Nor hand of friend, nor loving face,"
waltwhitman,"Nor favor comes, nor word of grace."
waltwhitman,"It was not I that sinn'd the sin,"
waltwhitman,The ruthless body dragg'd me in;
waltwhitman,"Though long I strove courageously,"
waltwhitman,The body was too much for me.
waltwhitman,"Dear prison'd soul bear up a space,"
waltwhitman,For soon or late the certain grace;
waltwhitman,"To set thee free and bear thee home,"
waltwhitman,The heavenly pardoner death shall come.
waltwhitman,"Convict no more, nor shame, nor dole!"
waltwhitman,Depart--a God-enfranchis'd soul!
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"The singer ceas'd,"
waltwhitman,"One glance swept from her clear calm eyes o'er all those upturn'd faces,"
waltwhitman,"Strange sea of prison faces, a thousand varied, crafty, brutal,"
waltwhitman,"seam'd and beauteous faces,"
waltwhitman,"Then rising, passing back along the narrow aisle between them,"
waltwhitman,"While her gown touch'd them rustling in the silence,"
waltwhitman,She vanish'd with her children in the dusk.
waltwhitman,"While upon all, convicts and armed keepers ere they stirr'd,"
waltwhitman,"(Convict forgetting prison, keeper his loaded pistol,)"
waltwhitman,"A hush and pause fell down a wondrous minute,"
waltwhitman,"With deep half-stifled sobs and sound of bad men bow'd and moved to weeping,"
waltwhitman,"And youth's convulsive breathings, memories of home,"
waltwhitman,"The mother's voice in lullaby, the sister's care, the happy childhood,"
waltwhitman,The long-pent spirit rous'd to reminiscence;
waltwhitman,"A wondrous minute then--but after in the solitary night, to many,"
waltwhitman,"many there,"
waltwhitman,"Years after, even in the hour of death, the sad refrain, the tune,"
waltwhitman,"the voice, the words,"
waltwhitman,"Resumed, the large calm lady walks the narrow aisle,"
waltwhitman,"The wailing melody again, the singer in the prison sings,"
waltwhitman,"O sight of pity, shame and dole!"
waltwhitman,O fearful thought--a convict soul.
waltwhitman,Warble for Lilac-Time
waltwhitman,"Warble me now for joy of lilac-time, (returning in reminiscence,)"
waltwhitman,"Sort me O tongue and lips for Nature's sake, souvenirs of earliest summer,"
waltwhitman,"Gather the welcome signs, (as children with pebbles or stringing shells,)"
waltwhitman,"Put in April and May, the hylas croaking in the ponds, the elastic air,"
waltwhitman,"Bees, butterflies, the sparrow with its simple notes,"
waltwhitman,"Blue-bird and darting swallow, nor forget the high-hole flashing his"
waltwhitman,"golden wings,"
waltwhitman,"The tranquil sunny haze, the clinging smoke, the vapor,"
waltwhitman,"Shimmer of waters with fish in them, the cerulean above,"
waltwhitman,"All that is jocund and sparkling, the brooks running,"
waltwhitman,"The maple woods, the crisp February days and the sugar-making,"
waltwhitman,"The robin where he hops, bright-eyed, brown-breasted,"
waltwhitman,"With musical clear call at sunrise, and again at sunset,"
waltwhitman,"Or flitting among the trees of the apple-orchard, building the nest"
waltwhitman,"of his mate,"
waltwhitman,"The melted snow of March, the willow sending forth its yellow-green sprouts,"
waltwhitman,For spring-time is here! the summer is here! and what is this in it
waltwhitman,and from it?
waltwhitman,"Thou, soul, unloosen'd--the restlessness after I know not what;"
waltwhitman,"Come, let us lag here no longer, let us be up and away!"
waltwhitman,O if one could but fly like a bird!
waltwhitman,"O to escape, to sail forth as in a ship!"
waltwhitman,"To glide with thee O soul, o'er all, in all, as a ship o'er the waters;"
waltwhitman,"Gathering these hints, the preludes, the blue sky, the grass, the"
waltwhitman,"morning drops of dew,"
waltwhitman,"The lilac-scent, the bushes with dark green heart-shaped leaves,"
waltwhitman,"Wood-violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence,"
waltwhitman,"Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their atmosphere,"
waltwhitman,"To grace the bush I love--to sing with the birds,"
waltwhitman,A warble for joy of returning in reminiscence.
waltwhitman,"Outlines for a Tomb [G. P., Buried 1870]"
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"What may we chant, O thou within this tomb?"
waltwhitman,"What tablets, outlines, hang for thee, O millionnaire?"
waltwhitman,"The life thou lived'st we know not,"
waltwhitman,"But that thou walk'dst thy years in barter, 'mid the haunts of"
waltwhitman,"brokers,"
waltwhitman,"Nor heroism thine, nor war, nor glory."
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Silent, my soul,"
waltwhitman,"With drooping lids, as waiting, ponder'd,"
waltwhitman,"Turning from all the samples, monuments of heroes."
waltwhitman,"While through the interior vistas,"
waltwhitman,"Noiseless uprose, phantasmic, (as by night Auroras of the north,)"
waltwhitman,"Lambent tableaus, prophetic, bodiless scenes,"
waltwhitman,Spiritual projections.
waltwhitman,"In one, among the city streets a laborer's home appear'd,"
waltwhitman,"After his day's work done, cleanly, sweet-air'd, the gaslight burning,"
waltwhitman,The carpet swept and a fire in the cheerful stove.
waltwhitman,"In one, the sacred parturition scene,"
waltwhitman,A happy painless mother birth'd a perfect child.
waltwhitman,"In one, at a bounteous morning meal,"
waltwhitman,Sat peaceful parents with contented sons.
waltwhitman,"In one, by twos and threes, young people,"
waltwhitman,"Hundreds concentring, walk'd the paths and streets and roads,"
waltwhitman,Toward a tall-domed school.
waltwhitman,"In one a trio beautiful,"
waltwhitman,"Grandmother, loving daughter, loving daughter's daughter, sat,"
waltwhitman,Chatting and sewing.
waltwhitman,"In one, along a suite of noble rooms,"
waltwhitman,"'Mid plenteous books and journals, paintings on the walls, fine statuettes,"
waltwhitman,"Were groups of friendly journeymen, mechanics young and old,"
waltwhitman,"Reading, conversing."
waltwhitman,"All, all the shows of laboring life,"
waltwhitman,"City and country, women's, men's and children's,"
waltwhitman,"Their wants provided for, hued in the sun and tinged for once with joy,"
waltwhitman,"Marriage, the street, the factory, farm, the house-room, lodging-room,"
waltwhitman,"Labor and toll, the bath, gymnasium, playground, library, college,"
waltwhitman,"The student, boy or girl, led forward to be taught,"
waltwhitman,"The sick cared for, the shoeless shod, the orphan father'd and mother'd,"
waltwhitman,"The hungry fed, the houseless housed;"
waltwhitman,"(The intentions perfect and divine,"
waltwhitman,"The workings, details, haply human.)"
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"O thou within this tomb,"
waltwhitman,"From thee such scenes, thou stintless, lavish giver,"
waltwhitman,"Tallying the gifts of earth, large as the earth,"
waltwhitman,"Thy name an earth, with mountains, fields and tides."
waltwhitman,"Nor by your streams alone, you rivers,"
waltwhitman,"By you, your banks Connecticut,"
waltwhitman,"By you and all your teeming life old Thames,"
waltwhitman,"By you Potomac laving the ground Washington trod, by you Patapsco,"
waltwhitman,"You Hudson, you endless Mississippi--nor you alone,"
waltwhitman,"But to the high seas launch, my thought, his memory."
waltwhitman,Out from Behind This Mask [To Confront a Portrait]
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Out from behind this bending rough-cut mask,"
waltwhitman,"These lights and shades, this drama of the whole,"
waltwhitman,"This common curtain of the face contain'd in me for me, in you for"
waltwhitman,"you, in each for each,"
waltwhitman,"(Tragedies, sorrows, laughter, tears--0 heaven!"
waltwhitman,The passionate teeming plays this curtain hid!)
waltwhitman,"This glaze of God's serenest purest sky,"
waltwhitman,"This film of Satan's seething pit,"
waltwhitman,"This heart's geography's map, this limitless small continent, this"
waltwhitman,soundless sea;
waltwhitman,"Out from the convolutions of this globe,"
waltwhitman,"This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon, than Jupiter, Venus, Mars,"
waltwhitman,"This condensation of the universe, (nay here the only universe,"
waltwhitman,"Here the idea, all in this mystic handful wrapt;)"
waltwhitman,"These burin'd eyes, flashing to you to pass to future time,"
waltwhitman,"To launch and spin through space revolving sideling, from these to emanate,"
waltwhitman,To you whoe'er you are--a look.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"A traveler of thoughts and years, of peace and war,"
waltwhitman,"Of youth long sped and middle age declining,"
waltwhitman,"(As the first volume of a tale perused and laid away, and this the second,"
waltwhitman,"Songs, ventures, speculations, presently to close,)"
waltwhitman,"Lingering a moment here and now, to you I opposite turn,"
waltwhitman,"As on the road or at some crevice door by chance, or open'd window,"
waltwhitman,"Pausing, inclining, baring my head, you specially I greet,"
waltwhitman,"To draw and clinch your soul for once inseparably with mine,"
waltwhitman,Then travel travel on.
waltwhitman,Vocalism
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Vocalism, measure, concentration, determination, and the divine"
waltwhitman,power to speak words;
waltwhitman,Are you full-lung'd and limber-lipp'd from long trial? from vigorous
waltwhitman,practice? from physique?
waltwhitman,Do you move in these broad lands as broad as they?
waltwhitman,Come duly to the divine power to speak words?
waltwhitman,"For only at last after many years, after chastity, friendship,"
waltwhitman,"procreation, prudence, and nakedness,"
waltwhitman,"After treading ground and breasting river and lake,"
waltwhitman,"After a loosen'd throat, after absorbing eras, temperaments, races,"
waltwhitman,"after knowledge, freedom, crimes,"
waltwhitman,"After complete faith, after clarifyings, elevations, and removing"
waltwhitman,"obstructions,"
waltwhitman,"After these and more, it is just possible there comes to a man,"
waltwhitman,"woman, the divine power to speak words;"
waltwhitman,Then toward that man or that woman swiftly hasten all--none
waltwhitman,"refuse, all attend,"
waltwhitman,"Armies, ships, antiquities, libraries, paintings, machines, cities,"
waltwhitman,"hate, despair, amity, pain, theft, murder, aspiration, form in"
waltwhitman,"close ranks,"
waltwhitman,They debouch as they are wanted to march obediently through the
waltwhitman,mouth of that man or that woman.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,O what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices?
waltwhitman,"Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her I shall follow,"
waltwhitman,"As the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps, anywhere"
waltwhitman,around the globe.
waltwhitman,All waits for the right voices;
waltwhitman,Where is the practis'd and perfect organ? where is the develop'd soul?
waltwhitman,"For I see every word utter'd thence has deeper, sweeter, new sounds,"
waltwhitman,impossible on less terms.
waltwhitman,"I see brains and lips closed, tympans and temples unstruck,"
waltwhitman,"Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose,"
waltwhitman,Until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies
waltwhitman,slumbering forever ready in all words.
waltwhitman,To Him That Was Crucified
waltwhitman,"My spirit to yours dear brother,"
waltwhitman,"Do not mind because many sounding your name do not understand you,"
waltwhitman,"I do not sound your name, but I understand you,"
waltwhitman,"I specify you with joy O my comrade to salute you, and to salute"
waltwhitman,"those who are with you, before and since, and those to come also,"
waltwhitman,"That we all labor together transmitting the same charge and succession,"
waltwhitman,"We few equals indifferent of lands, indifferent of times,"
waltwhitman,"We, enclosers of all continents, all castes, allowers of all theologies,"
waltwhitman,"Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,"
waltwhitman,"We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the"
waltwhitman,"disputers nor any thing that is asserted,"
waltwhitman,"We hear the bawling and din, we are reach'd at by divisions,"
waltwhitman,"jealousies, recriminations on every side,"
waltwhitman,"They close peremptorily upon us to surround us, my comrade,"
waltwhitman,"Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, journeying up and"
waltwhitman,"down till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the diverse eras,"
waltwhitman,"Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and women of races,"
waltwhitman,"ages to come, may prove brethren and lovers as we are."
waltwhitman,You Felons on Trial in Courts
waltwhitman,"You felons on trial in courts,"
waltwhitman,"You convicts in prison-cells, you sentenced assassins chain'd and"
waltwhitman,"handcuff'd with iron,"
waltwhitman,Who am I too that I am not on trial or in prison?
waltwhitman,"Me ruthless and devilish as any, that my wrists are not chain'd with"
waltwhitman,"iron, or my ankles with iron?"
waltwhitman,"You prostitutes flaunting over the trottoirs or obscene in your rooms,"
waltwhitman,Who am I that I should call you more obscene than myself?
waltwhitman,O culpable! I acknowledge--I expose!
waltwhitman,"(O admirers, praise not me--compliment not me--you make me wince,"
waltwhitman,I see what you do not--I know what you do not.)
waltwhitman,"Inside these breast-bones I lie smutch'd and choked,"
waltwhitman,"Beneath this face that appears so impassive hell's tides continually run,"
waltwhitman,"Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me,"
waltwhitman,"I walk with delinquents with passionate love,"
waltwhitman,"I feel I am of them--I belong to those convicts and prostitutes myself,"
waltwhitman,And henceforth I will not deny them--for how can I deny myself?
waltwhitman,Laws for Creations
waltwhitman,"Laws for creations,"
waltwhitman,"For strong artists and leaders, for fresh broods of teachers and"
waltwhitman,"perfect literats for America,"
waltwhitman,For noble savans and coming musicians.
waltwhitman,"All must have reference to the ensemble of the world, and the"
waltwhitman,"compact truth of the world,"
waltwhitman,There shall be no subject too pronounced--all works shall illustrate
waltwhitman,the divine law of indirections.
waltwhitman,What do you suppose creation is?
waltwhitman,"What do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to walk free and"
waltwhitman,own no superior?
waltwhitman,"What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways, but"
waltwhitman,that man or woman is as good as God?
waltwhitman,And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself?
waltwhitman,And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean?
waltwhitman,And that you or any one must approach creations through such laws?
waltwhitman,To a Common Prostitute
waltwhitman,"Be composed--be at ease with me--I am Walt Whitman, liberal and"
waltwhitman,"lusty as Nature,"
waltwhitman,"Not till the sun excludes you do I exclude you,"
waltwhitman,Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to
waltwhitman,"rustle for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you."
waltwhitman,"My girl I appoint with you an appointment, and I charge you that you"
waltwhitman,"make preparation to be worthy to meet me,"
waltwhitman,And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come.
waltwhitman,Till then I salute you with a significant look that you do not forget me.
waltwhitman,I Was Looking a Long While
waltwhitman,"I was looking a long while for Intentions,"
waltwhitman,"For a clew to the history of the past for myself, and for these"
waltwhitman,"chants--and now I have found it,"
waltwhitman,"It is not in those paged fables in the libraries, (them I neither"
waltwhitman,"accept nor reject,)"
waltwhitman,"It is no more in the legends than in all else,"
waltwhitman,"It is in the present--it is this earth to-day,"
waltwhitman,"It is in Democracy--(the purport and aim of all the past,)"
waltwhitman,"It is the life of one man or one woman to-day--the average man of to-day,"
waltwhitman,"It is in languages, social customs, literatures, arts,"
waltwhitman,"It is in the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery,"
waltwhitman,"politics, creeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of nations,"
waltwhitman,All for the modern--all for the average man of to-day.
waltwhitman,Thought
waltwhitman,"Of persons arrived at high positions, ceremonies, wealth,"
waltwhitman,"scholarships, and the like;"
waltwhitman,"(To me all that those persons have arrived at sinks away from them,"
waltwhitman,"except as it results to their bodies and souls,"
waltwhitman,"So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked,"
waltwhitman,"And often to me each one mocks the others, and mocks himself or herself,"
waltwhitman,"And of each one the core of life, namely happiness, is full of the"
waltwhitman,"rotten excrement of maggots,"
waltwhitman,And often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true
waltwhitman,"realities of life, and go toward false realities,"
waltwhitman,"And often to me they are alive after what custom has served them,"
waltwhitman,"but nothing more,"
waltwhitman,"And often to me they are sad, hasty, unwaked sonnambules walking the dusk.)"
waltwhitman,Miracles
waltwhitman,"Why, who makes much of a miracle?"
waltwhitman,"As to me I know of nothing else but miracles,"
waltwhitman,"Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan,"
waltwhitman,"Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,"
waltwhitman,"Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water,"
waltwhitman,"Or stand under trees in the woods,"
waltwhitman,"Or talk by day with any one I love, or sleep in the bed at night"
waltwhitman,"with any one I love,"
waltwhitman,"Or sit at table at dinner with the rest,"
waltwhitman,"Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,"
waltwhitman,"Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon,"
waltwhitman,"Or animals feeding in the fields,"
waltwhitman,"Or birds, or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,"
waltwhitman,"Or the wonderfulness of the sundown, or of stars shining so quiet"
waltwhitman,"and bright,"
waltwhitman,Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring;
waltwhitman,"These with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,"
waltwhitman,"The whole referring, yet each distinct and in its place."
waltwhitman,"To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,"
waltwhitman,"Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,"
waltwhitman,"Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same,"
waltwhitman,Every foot of the interior swarms with the same.
waltwhitman,"To me the sea is a continual miracle,"
waltwhitman,The fishes that swim--the rocks--the motion of the waves--the
waltwhitman,"ships with men in them,"
waltwhitman,What stranger miracles are there?
waltwhitman,Sparkles from the Wheel
waltwhitman,"Where the city's ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day,"
waltwhitman,"Withdrawn I join a group of children watching, I pause aside with them."
waltwhitman,"By the curb toward the edge of the flagging,"
waltwhitman,"A knife-grinder works at his wheel sharpening a great knife,"
waltwhitman,"Bending over he carefully holds it to the stone, by foot and knee,"
waltwhitman,"With measur'd tread he turns rapidly, as he presses with light but"
waltwhitman,"firm hand,"
waltwhitman,"Forth issue then in copious golden jets,"
waltwhitman,Sparkles from the wheel.
waltwhitman,"The scene and all its belongings, how they seize and affect me,"
waltwhitman,The sad sharp-chinn'd old man with worn clothes and broad
waltwhitman,"shoulder-band of leather,"
waltwhitman,"Myself effusing and fluid, a phantom curiously floating, now here"
waltwhitman,"absorb'd and arrested,"
waltwhitman,"The group, (an unminded point set in a vast surrounding,)"
waltwhitman,"The attentive, quiet children, the loud, proud, restive base of the streets,"
waltwhitman,"The low hoarse purr of the whirling stone, the light-press'd blade,"
waltwhitman,"Diffusing, dropping, sideways-darting, in tiny showers of gold,"
waltwhitman,Sparkles from the wheel.
waltwhitman,To a Pupil
waltwhitman,Is reform needed? is it through you?
waltwhitman,"The greater the reform needed, the greater the Personality you need"
waltwhitman,to accomplish it.
waltwhitman,"You! do you not see how it would serve to have eyes, blood,"
waltwhitman,"complexion, clean and sweet?"
waltwhitman,Do you not see how it would serve to have such a body and soul that
waltwhitman,when you enter the crowd an atmosphere of desire and command
waltwhitman,"enters with you, and every one is impress'd with your Personality?"
waltwhitman,O the magnet! the flesh over and over!
waltwhitman,"Go, dear friend, if need be give up all else, and commence to-day to"
waltwhitman,"inure yourself to pluck, reality, self-esteem, definiteness,"
waltwhitman,"elevatedness,"
waltwhitman,Rest not till you rivet and publish yourself of your own Personality.
waltwhitman,Unfolded out of the Folds
waltwhitman,"Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded, and is"
waltwhitman,"always to come unfolded,"
waltwhitman,Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth is to come the
waltwhitman,"superbest man of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"Unfolded out of the friendliest woman is to come the friendliest man,"
waltwhitman,Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman can a man be
waltwhitman,"form'd of perfect body,"
waltwhitman,Unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of woman can come the
waltwhitman,"poems of man, (only thence have my poems come;)"
waltwhitman,"Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I love, only thence"
waltwhitman,"can appear the strong and arrogant man I love,"
waltwhitman,Unfolded by brawny embraces from the well-muscled woman
waltwhitman,"love, only thence come the brawny embraces of the man,"
waltwhitman,Unfolded out of the folds of the woman's brain come all the folds
waltwhitman,"of the man's brain, duly obedient,"
waltwhitman,"Unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded,"
waltwhitman,Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy;
waltwhitman,"A man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity, but"
waltwhitman,every of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman;
waltwhitman,"First the man is shaped in the woman, he can then be shaped in himself."
waltwhitman,What Am I After All
waltwhitman,"What am I after all but a child, pleas'd with the sound of my own"
waltwhitman,name? repeating it over and over;
waltwhitman,I stand apart to hear--it never tires me.
waltwhitman,To you your name also;
waltwhitman,Did you think there was nothing but two or three pronunciations in
waltwhitman,the sound of your name?
waltwhitman,Kosmos
waltwhitman,"Who includes diversity and is Nature,"
waltwhitman,"Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of"
waltwhitman,"the earth, and the great charity of the earth, and the equilibrium also,"
waltwhitman,"Who has not look'd forth from the windows the eyes for nothing,"
waltwhitman,"or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,"
waltwhitman,"Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,"
waltwhitman,"Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism,"
waltwhitman,"spiritualism, and of the aesthetic or intellectual,"
waltwhitman,"Who having consider'd the body finds all its organs and parts good,"
waltwhitman,"Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body"
waltwhitman,"understands by subtle analogies all other theories,"
waltwhitman,"The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;"
waltwhitman,"Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in"
waltwhitman,"other globes with their suns and moons,"
waltwhitman,"Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day"
waltwhitman,"but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,"
waltwhitman,"The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together."
waltwhitman,Others May Praise What They Like
waltwhitman,Others may praise what they like;
waltwhitman,"But I, from the banks of the running Missouri, praise nothing in art"
waltwhitman,"or aught else,"
waltwhitman,"Till it has well inhaled the atmosphere of this river, also the"
waltwhitman,"western prairie-scent,"
waltwhitman,And exudes it all again.
waltwhitman,Who Learns My Lesson Complete?
waltwhitman,Who learns my lesson complete?
waltwhitman,"Boss, journeyman, apprentice, churchman and atheist,"
waltwhitman,"The stupid and the wise thinker, parents and offspring, merchant,"
waltwhitman,"clerk, porter and customer,"
waltwhitman,"Editor, author, artist, and schoolboy--draw nigh and commence;"
waltwhitman,"It is no lesson--it lets down the bars to a good lesson,"
waltwhitman,"And that to another, and every one to another still."
waltwhitman,"The great laws take and effuse without argument,"
waltwhitman,"I am of the same style, for I am their friend,"
waltwhitman,"I love them quits and quits, I do not halt and make salaams."
waltwhitman,I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons
waltwhitman,"of things,"
waltwhitman,They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.
waltwhitman,I cannot say to any person what I hear--I cannot say it to myself--
waltwhitman,it is very wonderful.
waltwhitman,"It is no small matter, this round and delicious globe moving so"
waltwhitman,"exactly in its orbit for ever and ever, without one jolt or"
waltwhitman,"the untruth of a single second,"
waltwhitman,"I do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years,"
waltwhitman,"nor ten billions of years,"
waltwhitman,Nor plann'd and built one thing after another as an architect plans
waltwhitman,and builds a house.
waltwhitman,"I do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman,"
waltwhitman,"Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman,"
waltwhitman,"Nor that years will ever stop the existence of me, or any one else."
waltwhitman,Is it wonderful that I should be immortal? as every one is immortal;
waltwhitman,"I know it is wonderful, but my eyesight is equally wonderful, and"
waltwhitman,"how I was conceived in my mother's womb is equally wonderful,"
waltwhitman,And pass'd from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of
waltwhitman,summers and winters to articulate and walk--all this is
waltwhitman,equally wonderful.
waltwhitman,"And that my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other"
waltwhitman,"without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see"
waltwhitman,"each other, is every bit as wonderful."
waltwhitman,"And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful,"
waltwhitman,"And that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to"
waltwhitman,"be true, is just as wonderful."
waltwhitman,"And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth, is"
waltwhitman,"equally wonderful,"
waltwhitman,And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally
waltwhitman,wonderful.
waltwhitman,Tests
waltwhitman,"All submit to them where they sit, inner, secure, unapproachable to"
waltwhitman,"analysis in the soul,"
waltwhitman,"Not traditions, not the outer authorities are the judges,"
waltwhitman,"They are the judges of outer authorities and of all traditions,"
waltwhitman,"They corroborate as they go only whatever corroborates themselves,"
waltwhitman,and touches themselves;
waltwhitman,"For all that, they have it forever in themselves to corroborate far"
waltwhitman,and near without one exception.
waltwhitman,The Torch
waltwhitman,On my Northwest coast in the midst of the night a fishermen's group
waltwhitman,"stands watching,"
waltwhitman,"Out on the lake that expands before them, others are spearing salmon,"
waltwhitman,"The canoe, a dim shadowy thing, moves across the black water,"
waltwhitman,Bearing a torch ablaze at the prow.
waltwhitman,O Star of France [1870-71]
waltwhitman,"O star of France,"
waltwhitman,"The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame,"
waltwhitman,"Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long,"
waltwhitman,"Beseems to-day a wreck driven by the gale, a mastless hulk,"
waltwhitman,"And 'mid its teeming madden'd half-drown'd crowds,"
waltwhitman,Nor helm nor helmsman.
waltwhitman,"Dim smitten star,"
waltwhitman,"Orb not of France alone, pale symbol of my soul, its dearest hopes,"
waltwhitman,"The struggle and the daring, rage divine for liberty,"
waltwhitman,"Of aspirations toward the far ideal, enthusiast's dreams of brotherhood,"
waltwhitman,Of terror to the tyrant and the priest.
waltwhitman,"Star crucified--by traitors sold,"
waltwhitman,"Star panting o'er a land of death, heroic land,"
waltwhitman,"Strange, passionate, mocking, frivolous land."
waltwhitman,"Miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, I will not now rebuke thee,"
waltwhitman,"Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell'd them all,"
waltwhitman,And left thee sacred.
waltwhitman,"In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly,"
waltwhitman,"In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself however great the price,"
waltwhitman,"In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg'd sleep,"
waltwhitman,"In that alone among thy sisters thou, giantess, didst rend the ones"
waltwhitman,"that shamed thee,"
waltwhitman,"In that thou couldst not, wouldst not, wear the usual chains,"
waltwhitman,"This cross, thy livid face, thy pierced hands and feet,"
waltwhitman,The spear thrust in thy side.
waltwhitman,"O star! O ship of France, beat back and baffled long!"
waltwhitman,Bear up O smitten orb! O ship continue on!
waltwhitman,"Sure as the ship of all, the Earth itself,"
waltwhitman,"Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos,"
waltwhitman,"Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons,"
waltwhitman,"Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty,"
waltwhitman,"Onward beneath the sun following its course,"
waltwhitman,So thee O ship of France!
waltwhitman,"Finish'd the days, the clouds dispel'd"
waltwhitman,"The travail o'er, the long-sought extrication,"
waltwhitman,"When lo! reborn, high o'er the European world,"
waltwhitman,"(In gladness answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours"
waltwhitman,"Columbia,)"
waltwhitman,"Again thy star O France, fair lustrous star,"
waltwhitman,"In heavenly peace, clearer, more bright than ever,"
waltwhitman,Shall beam immortal.
waltwhitman,The Ox-Tamer
waltwhitman,"In a far-away northern county in the placid pastoral region,"
waltwhitman,"Lives my farmer friend, the theme of my recitative, a famous tamer of oxen,"
waltwhitman,There they bring him the three-year-olds and the four-year-olds to
waltwhitman,"break them,"
waltwhitman,"He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and tame him,"
waltwhitman,He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock
waltwhitman,"chafes up and down the yard,"
waltwhitman,"The bullock's head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes,"
waltwhitman,Yet see you! how soon his rage subsides--how soon this tamer tames him;
waltwhitman,"See you! on the farms hereabout a hundred oxen young and old,"
waltwhitman,"and he is the man who has tamed them,"
waltwhitman,"They all know him, all are affectionate to him;"
waltwhitman,"See you! some are such beautiful animals, so lofty looking;"
waltwhitman,"Some are buff-color'd, some mottled, one has a white line running"
waltwhitman,"along his back, some are brindled,"
waltwhitman,"Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)--see you! the bright hides,"
waltwhitman,"See, the two with stars on their foreheads--see, the round bodies"
waltwhitman,"and broad backs,"
waltwhitman,How straight and square they stand on their legs--what fine sagacious eyes!
waltwhitman,How straight they watch their tamer--they wish him near them--how
waltwhitman,they turn to look after him!
waltwhitman,What yearning expression! how uneasy they are when he moves away from them;
waltwhitman,"Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics,"
waltwhitman,"poems, depart--all else departs,)"
waltwhitman,"I confess I envy only his fascination--my silent, illiterate friend,"
waltwhitman,"Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms,"
waltwhitman,"In the northern county far, in the placid pastoral region."
waltwhitman,An Old Man's Thought of School
waltwhitman,"[For the Inauguration of a Public School, Camden, New Jersey, 1874]"
waltwhitman,"An old man's thought of school,"
waltwhitman,An old man gathering youthful memories and blooms that youth itself cannot.
waltwhitman,"Now only do I know you,"
waltwhitman,O fair auroral skies--O morning dew upon the grass!
waltwhitman,"And these I see, these sparkling eyes,"
waltwhitman,"These stores of mystic meaning, these young lives,"
waltwhitman,"Building, equipping like a fleet of ships, immortal ships,"
waltwhitman,"Soon to sail out over the measureless seas,"
waltwhitman,On the soul's voyage.
waltwhitman,Only a lot of boys and girls?
waltwhitman,"Only the tiresome spelling, writing, ciphering classes?"
waltwhitman,Only a public school?
waltwhitman,"Ah more, infinitely more;"
waltwhitman,"(As George Fox rais'd his warning cry, ""Is it this pile of brick and"
waltwhitman,"mortar, these dead floors, windows, rails, you call the church?"
waltwhitman,"Why this is not the church at all--the church is living, ever living"
waltwhitman,"souls."")"
waltwhitman,"And you America,"
waltwhitman,Cast you the real reckoning for your present?
waltwhitman,"The lights and shadows of your future, good or evil?"
waltwhitman,"To girlhood, boyhood look, the teacher and the school."
waltwhitman,Wandering at Morn
waltwhitman,"Wandering at morn,"
waltwhitman,"Emerging from the night from gloomy thoughts, thee in my thoughts,"
waltwhitman,"Yearning for thee harmonious Union! thee, singing bird divine!"
waltwhitman,"Thee coil'd in evil times my country, with craft and black dismay,"
waltwhitman,"with every meanness, treason thrust upon thee,"
waltwhitman,"This common marvel I beheld--the parent thrush I watch'd feeding its young,"
waltwhitman,"The singing thrush whose tones of joy and faith ecstatic,"
waltwhitman,Fail not to certify and cheer my soul.
waltwhitman,"There ponder'd, felt I,"
waltwhitman,"If worms, snakes, loathsome grubs, may to sweet spiritual songs be turn'd,"
waltwhitman,"If vermin so transposed, so used and bless'd may be,"
waltwhitman,"Then may I trust in you, your fortunes, days, my country;"
waltwhitman,Who knows but these may be the lessons fit for you?
waltwhitman,"From these your future song may rise with joyous trills,"
waltwhitman,Destin'd to fill the world.
waltwhitman,Italian Music in Dakota
waltwhitman,"[""The Seventeenth--the finest Regimental Band I ever heard.""]"
waltwhitman,"Through the soft evening air enwinding all,"
waltwhitman,"Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless wilds,"
waltwhitman,"In dulcet streams, in flutes' and cornets' notes,"
waltwhitman,"Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial,"
waltwhitman,"(Yet strangely fitting even here, meanings unknown before,"
waltwhitman,"Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, related here,"
waltwhitman,"Not to the city's fresco'd rooms, not to the audience of the opera house,"
waltwhitman,"Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at home,"
waltwhitman,"Sonnambula's innocent love, trios with Norma's anguish,"
waltwhitman,And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto;)
waltwhitman,"Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,"
waltwhitman,"Music, Italian music in Dakota."
waltwhitman,"While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm,"
waltwhitman,"Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,"
waltwhitman,"Acknowledging rapport however far remov'd,"
waltwhitman,"(As some old root or soil of earth its last-born flower or fruit,)"
waltwhitman,Listens well pleas'd.
waltwhitman,With All Thy Gifts
waltwhitman,"With all thy gifts America,"
waltwhitman,"Standing secure, rapidly tending, overlooking the world,"
waltwhitman,"Power, wealth, extent, vouchsafed to thee--with these and like of"
waltwhitman,"these vouchsafed to thee,"
waltwhitman,"What if one gift thou lackest? (the ultimate human problem never solving,)"
waltwhitman,The gift of perfect women fit for thee--what if that gift of gifts
waltwhitman,thou lackest?
waltwhitman,"The towering feminine of thee? the beauty, health, completion, fit for thee?"
waltwhitman,The mothers fit for thee?
waltwhitman,My Picture-Gallery
waltwhitman,"In a little house keep I pictures suspended, it is not a fix'd house,"
waltwhitman,"It is round, it is only a few inches from one side to the other;"

waltwhitman,"Here the tableaus of life, and here the groupings of death;"
waltwhitman,"Here, do you know this? this is cicerone himself,"
waltwhitman,With finger rais'd he points to the prodigal pictures.

waltwhitman,"The crown and teeming paradise, so far, of time's accumulations,"
waltwhitman,To justify the past.

waltwhitman,beautiful.
waltwhitman,"I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other sleepers"
waltwhitman,"each in turn,"
waltwhitman,"I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,"
waltwhitman,And I become the other dreamers.
waltwhitman,I am a dance--play up there! the fit is whirling me fast!
waltwhitman,"I am the ever-laughing--it is new moon and twilight,"
waltwhitman,"I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever way look,"
waltwhitman,"Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where it is"
waltwhitman,neither ground nor sea.
waltwhitman,"Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,"
waltwhitman,"Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,"
waltwhitman,"I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides,"
waltwhitman,"And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk,"
waltwhitman,"To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch'd arms, and"
waltwhitman,resume the way;
waltwhitman,"Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting"
waltwhitman,music and wild-flapping pennants of joy!
waltwhitman,"I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,"
waltwhitman,"The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,"
waltwhitman,"He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after to-day,"
waltwhitman,"The stammerer, the well-form'd person, the wasted or feeble person."
waltwhitman,"I am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly,"
waltwhitman,"My truant lover has come, and it is dark."
waltwhitman,"Double yourself and receive me darkness,"
waltwhitman,"Receive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without him."
waltwhitman,"I roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the dusk."
waltwhitman,"He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,"
waltwhitman,He rises with me silently from the bed.
waltwhitman,"Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty and panting,"
waltwhitman,I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.
waltwhitman,"My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,"
waltwhitman,I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.
waltwhitman,Be careful darkness! already what was it touch'd me?
waltwhitman,"I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,"
waltwhitman,"I hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away."
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,"
waltwhitman,Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.
waltwhitman,"It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman's,"
waltwhitman,I sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson's
waltwhitman,stockings.
waltwhitman,"It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight,"
waltwhitman,I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.
waltwhitman,"A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the coffin,"
waltwhitman,"It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is"
waltwhitman,"blank here, for reasons."
waltwhitman,"(It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy,"
waltwhitman,Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough.)
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies
waltwhitman,"of the sea,"
waltwhitman,"His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with"
waltwhitman,"courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs,"
waltwhitman,"I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,"
waltwhitman,I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on
waltwhitman,the rocks.
waltwhitman,What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?
waltwhitman,Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime
waltwhitman,of his middle age?
waltwhitman,"Steady and long he struggles,"
waltwhitman,"He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his strength"
waltwhitman,"holds out,"
waltwhitman,"The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away,"
waltwhitman,"they roll him, swing him, turn him,"
waltwhitman,"His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is"
waltwhitman,"continually bruis'd on rocks,"
waltwhitman,Swiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"I turn but do not extricate myself,"
waltwhitman,"Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet."
waltwhitman,"The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound,"
waltwhitman,"The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts."
waltwhitman,"I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as"
waltwhitman,"she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter."
waltwhitman,"I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,"
waltwhitman,I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me.
waltwhitman,"I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash'd to us alive,"
waltwhitman,In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,"
waltwhitman,"Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench'd"
waltwhitman,hills amid a crowd of officers.
waltwhitman,"His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,"
waltwhitman,"He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch'd"
waltwhitman,"from his cheeks,"
waltwhitman,He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by
waltwhitman,their parents.
waltwhitman,"The same at last and at last when peace is declared,"
waltwhitman,"He stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov'd soldiers"
waltwhitman,"all pass through,"
waltwhitman,"The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,"
waltwhitman,"The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek,"
waltwhitman,"He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes hands"
waltwhitman,and bids good-by to the army.
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,"Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together,"
waltwhitman,Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on
waltwhitman,the old homestead.
waltwhitman,"A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,"
waltwhitman,"On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,"
waltwhitman,"Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd"
waltwhitman,"her face,"
waltwhitman,"Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as"
waltwhitman,she spoke.
waltwhitman,"My mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger,"
waltwhitman,She look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and
waltwhitman,"pliant limbs,"
waltwhitman,"The more she look'd upon her she loved her,"
waltwhitman,"Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,"
waltwhitman,"She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she cook'd"
waltwhitman,"food for her,"
waltwhitman,"She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness."
waltwhitman,"The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the"
waltwhitman,"afternoon she went away,"
waltwhitman,"O my mother was loth to have her go away,"
waltwhitman,"All the week she thought of her, she watch'd for her many a month,"
waltwhitman,"She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,"
waltwhitman,But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,A show of the summer softness--a contact of something unseen--an
waltwhitman,"amour of the light and air,"
waltwhitman,"I am jealous and overwhelm'd with friendliness,"
waltwhitman,And will go gallivant with the light and air myself.
waltwhitman,"O love and summer, you are in the dreams and in me,"
waltwhitman,"Autumn and winter are in the dreams, the farmer goes with his thrift,"
waltwhitman,"The droves and crops increase, the barns are well-fill'd."
waltwhitman,"Elements merge in the night, ships make tacks in the dreams,"
waltwhitman,"The sailor sails, the exile returns home,"
waltwhitman,"The fugitive returns unharm'd, the immigrant is back beyond months"
waltwhitman,"and years,"
waltwhitman,The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood with
waltwhitman,"the well known neighbors and faces,"
waltwhitman,"They warmly welcome him, he is barefoot again, he forgets he is well off,"
waltwhitman,"The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage"
waltwhitman,"home, and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home,"
waltwhitman,"To every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill'd ships,"
waltwhitman,"The Swiss foots it toward his hills, the Prussian goes his way, the"
waltwhitman,"Hungarian his way, and the Pole his way,"
waltwhitman,"The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return."
waltwhitman,"The homeward bound and the outward bound,"
waltwhitman,"The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuye, the onanist, the female that"
waltwhitman,"loves unrequited, the money-maker,"
waltwhitman,"The actor and actress, those through with their parts and those"
waltwhitman,"waiting to commence,"
waltwhitman,"The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee"
waltwhitman,"that is chosen and the nominee that has fail'd,"
waltwhitman,"The great already known and the great any time after to-day,"
waltwhitman,"The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form'd, the homely,"
waltwhitman,"The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sentenced"
waltwhitman,"him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience,"
waltwhitman,"The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red squaw,"
waltwhitman,"The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is wrong'd,"
waltwhitman,"The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,"
waltwhitman,"I swear they are averaged now--one is no better than the other,"
waltwhitman,The night and sleep have liken'd them and restored them.
waltwhitman,"I swear they are all beautiful,"
waltwhitman,"Every one that sleeps is beautiful, every thing in the dim light is"
waltwhitman,"beautiful,"
waltwhitman,"The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace."
waltwhitman,"Peace is always beautiful,"
waltwhitman,The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.
waltwhitman,"The myth of heaven indicates the soul,"
waltwhitman,"The soul is always beautiful, it appears more or it appears less, it"
waltwhitman,"comes or it lags behind,"
waltwhitman,It comes from its embower'd garden and looks pleasantly on itself
waltwhitman,"and encloses the world,"
waltwhitman,"Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting,and perfect and"
waltwhitman,"clean the womb cohering,"
waltwhitman,"The head well-grown proportion'd and plumb, and the bowels and"
waltwhitman,joints proportion'd and plumb.
waltwhitman,"The soul is always beautiful,"
waltwhitman,"The universe is duly in order, every thing is in its place,"
waltwhitman,"What has arrived is in its place and what waits shall be in its place,"
waltwhitman,"The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,"
waltwhitman,"The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of"
waltwhitman,"the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long,"
waltwhitman,"The sleepers that lived and died wait, the far advanced are to go on"
waltwhitman,"in their turns, and the far behind are to come on in their turns,"
waltwhitman,"The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite--"
waltwhitman,they unite now.
waltwhitman,8
waltwhitman,"The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,"
waltwhitman,They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to west as
waltwhitman,"they lie unclothed,"
waltwhitman,"The Asiatic and African are hand in hand, the European and American"
waltwhitman,"are hand in hand,"
waltwhitman,"Learn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and female are hand"
waltwhitman,"in hand,"
waltwhitman,"The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover, they"
waltwhitman,"press close without lust, his lips press her neck,"
waltwhitman,The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with
waltwhitman,"measureless love, and the son holds the father in his arms with"
waltwhitman,"measureless love,"
waltwhitman,"The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter,"
waltwhitman,"The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is"
waltwhitman,"inarm'd by friend,"
waltwhitman,"The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the scholar,"
waltwhitman,"the wrong 'd made right,"
waltwhitman,"The call of the slave is one with the master's call, and the master"
waltwhitman,"salutes the slave,"
waltwhitman,"The felon steps forth from the prison, the insane becomes sane, the"
waltwhitman,"suffering of sick persons is reliev'd,"
waltwhitman,"The sweatings and fevers stop, the throat that was unsound is sound,"
waltwhitman,"the lungs of the consumptive are resumed, the poor distress'd"
waltwhitman,"head is free,"
waltwhitman,"The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother"
waltwhitman,"than ever,"
waltwhitman,"Stiflings and passages open, the paralyzed become supple,"
waltwhitman,"The swell'd and convuls'd and congested awake to themselves in condition,"
waltwhitman,They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of the
waltwhitman,"night, and awake."
waltwhitman,"I too pass from the night,"
waltwhitman,"I stay a while away O night, but I return to you again and love you."
waltwhitman,Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you?
waltwhitman,"I am not afraid, I have been well brought forward by you,"
waltwhitman,"I love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long,"
waltwhitman,"I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go with you, but"
waltwhitman,I know I came well and shall go well.
waltwhitman,"I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes,"
waltwhitman,"I will duly pass the day O my mother, and duly return to you."
waltwhitman,Transpositions
waltwhitman,Let the reformers descend from the stands where they are forever
waltwhitman,bawling--let an idiot or insane person appear on each of the stands;
waltwhitman,Let judges and criminals be transposed--let the prison-keepers be
waltwhitman,put in prison--let those that were prisoners take the keys;
waltwhitman,Let them that distrust birth and death lead the rest.
waltwhitman,BOOK XXIX
waltwhitman,To Think of Time
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"To think of time--of all that retrospection,"
waltwhitman,"To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward."
waltwhitman,Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?
waltwhitman,Have you dreaded these earth-beetles?
waltwhitman,Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?
waltwhitman,Is to-day nothing? is the beginningless past nothing?
waltwhitman,If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing.
waltwhitman,To think that the sun rose in the east--that men and women were
waltwhitman,"flexible, real, alive--that every thing was alive,"
waltwhitman,"To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part,"
waltwhitman,To think that we are now here and bear our part.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Not a day passes, not a minute or second without an accouchement,"
waltwhitman,"Not a day passes, not a minute or second without a corpse."
waltwhitman,"The dull nights go over and the dull days also,"
waltwhitman,"The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,"
waltwhitman,The physician after long putting off gives the silent and terrible
waltwhitman,"look for an answer,"
waltwhitman,"The children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters"
waltwhitman,"are sent for,"
waltwhitman,"Medicines stand unused on the shelf, (the camphor-smell has long"
waltwhitman,"pervaded the rooms,)"
waltwhitman,"The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying,"
waltwhitman,"The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,"
waltwhitman,"The breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases,"
waltwhitman,"The corpse stretches on the bed and the living look upon it,"
waltwhitman,It is palpable as the living are palpable.
waltwhitman,"The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,"
waltwhitman,But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously
waltwhitman,on the corpse.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"To think the thought of death merged in the thought of materials,"
waltwhitman,"To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking"
waltwhitman,"great interest in them, and we taking no interest in them."
waltwhitman,"To think how eager we are in building our houses,"
waltwhitman,"To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent."
waltwhitman,"(I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or"
waltwhitman,"seventy or eighty years at most,"
waltwhitman,I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.)
waltwhitman,Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth--they never
waltwhitman,"cease--they are the burial lines,"
waltwhitman,"He that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall"
waltwhitman,surely be buried.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"A reminiscence of the vulgar fate,"
waltwhitman,"A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,"
waltwhitman,Each after his kind.
waltwhitman,"Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf, posh and ice in the river,"
waltwhitman,"half-frozen mud in the streets,"
waltwhitman,"A gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last daylight of December,"
waltwhitman,"A hearse and stages, the funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver,"
waltwhitman,the cortege mostly drivers.
waltwhitman,"Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell,"
waltwhitman,"The gate is pass'd, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living"
waltwhitman,"alight, the hearse uncloses,"
waltwhitman,"The coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid on"
waltwhitman,"the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,"
waltwhitman,"The mound above is flatted with the spades--silence,"
waltwhitman,"A minute--no one moves or speaks--it is done,"
waltwhitman,He is decently put away--is there any thing more?
waltwhitman,"He was a good fellow, free-mouth'd, quick-temper'd, not bad-looking,"
waltwhitman,"Ready with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate"
waltwhitman,"hearty, drank hearty,"
waltwhitman,"Had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited toward the"
waltwhitman,"last, sicken'd, was help'd by a contribution,"
waltwhitman,"Died, aged forty-one years--and that was his funeral."
waltwhitman,"Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap,"
waltwhitman,"wet-weather clothes, whip carefully chosen,"
waltwhitman,"Boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody loafing on you, you"
waltwhitman,"loafing on somebody, headway, man before and man behind,"
waltwhitman,"Good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock, first out,"
waltwhitman,"last out, turning-in at night,"
waltwhitman,"To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers, and he"
waltwhitman,there takes no interest in them.
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"The markets, the government, the working-man's wages, to think what"
waltwhitman,"account they are through our nights and days,"
waltwhitman,To think that other working-men will make just as great account of
waltwhitman,"them, yet we make little or no account."
waltwhitman,"The vulgar and the refined, what you call sin and what you call"
waltwhitman,"goodness, to think how wide a difference,"
waltwhitman,"To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie"
waltwhitman,beyond the difference.
waltwhitman,"To think how much pleasure there is,"
waltwhitman,Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or
waltwhitman,planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and family?
waltwhitman,Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the
waltwhitman,beautiful maternal cares?
waltwhitman,"These also flow onward to others, you and I flow onward,"
waltwhitman,But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them.
waltwhitman,"Your farm, profits, crops--to think how engross'd you are,"
waltwhitman,"To think there will still be farms, profits, crops, yet for you of"
waltwhitman,what avail?
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,"What will be will be well, for what is is well,"
waltwhitman,"To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well."
waltwhitman,"The domestic joys, the dally housework or business, the building of"
waltwhitman,"houses, are not phantasms, they have weight, form, location,"
waltwhitman,"Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them"
waltwhitman,"phantasms,"
waltwhitman,"The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,"
waltwhitman,"The earth is not an echo, man and his life and all the things of his"
waltwhitman,life are well-consider'd.
waltwhitman,"You are not thrown to the winds, you gather certainly and safely"
waltwhitman,"around yourself,"
waltwhitman,"Yourself! yourself!. yourself, for ever and ever!"
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and
waltwhitman,"father, it is to identify you,"
waltwhitman,"It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be decided,"
waltwhitman,"Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you,"
waltwhitman,"You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes."
waltwhitman,"The threads that were spun are gather'd, the wet crosses the warp,"
waltwhitman,the pattern is systematic.
waltwhitman,"The preparations have every one been justified,"
waltwhitman,"The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments, the baton"
waltwhitman,has given the signal.
waltwhitman,"The guest that was coming, he waited long, he is now housed,"
waltwhitman,"He is one of those who are beautiful and happy, he is one of those"
waltwhitman,that to look upon and be with is enough.
waltwhitman,"The law of the past cannot be eluded,"
waltwhitman,"The law of the present and future cannot be eluded,"
waltwhitman,"The law of the living cannot be eluded, it is eternal,"
waltwhitman,"The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,"
waltwhitman,"The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,"
waltwhitman,"The law of drunkards, informers, mean persons, not one iota thereof"
waltwhitman,can be eluded.
waltwhitman,8
waltwhitman,"Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,"
waltwhitman,"Northerner goes carried and Southerner goes carried, and they on the"
waltwhitman,"Atlantic side and they on the Pacific,"
waltwhitman,"And they between, and all through the Mississippi country, and all"
waltwhitman,over the earth.
waltwhitman,"The great masters and kosmos are well as they go, the heroes and"
waltwhitman,"good-doers are well,"
waltwhitman,The known leaders and inventors and the rich owners and pious and
waltwhitman,"distinguish'd may be well,"
waltwhitman,"But there is more account than that, there is strict account of all."
waltwhitman,"The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,"
waltwhitman,"The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,"
waltwhitman,The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go.
waltwhitman,"Of and in all these things,"
waltwhitman,"I have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of"
waltwhitman,"us changed,"
waltwhitman,I have dream'd that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present
waltwhitman,"and past law,"
waltwhitman,"And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and"
waltwhitman,"past law,"
waltwhitman,For I have dream'd that the law they are under now is enough.
waltwhitman,"And I have dream'd that the purpose and essence of the known life,"
waltwhitman,"the transient,"
waltwhitman,"Is to form and decide identity for the unknown life, the permanent."
waltwhitman,"If all came but to ashes of dung,"
waltwhitman,"If maggots and rats ended us, then Alarum! for we are betray'd,"
waltwhitman,Then indeed suspicion of death.
waltwhitman,"Do you suspect death? if I were to suspect death I should die now,"
waltwhitman,Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation?
waltwhitman,"Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,"
waltwhitman,"Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,"
waltwhitman,"The whole universe indicates that it is good,"
waltwhitman,The past and the present indicate that it is good.
waltwhitman,How beautiful and perfect are the animals!
waltwhitman,"How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!"
waltwhitman,"What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,"
waltwhitman,"The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable"
waltwhitman,fluids perfect;
waltwhitman,"Slowly and surely they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and surely"
waltwhitman,they yet pass on.
waltwhitman,9
waltwhitman,I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an eternal soul!
waltwhitman,"The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! the"
waltwhitman,animals!
waltwhitman,I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!
waltwhitman,"That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for"
waltwhitman,"it, and the cohering is for it!"
waltwhitman,And all preparation is for it--and identity is for it--and life and
waltwhitman,materials are altogether for it!

waltwhitman,Darest Thou Now O Soul
waltwhitman,"Darest thou now O soul,"
waltwhitman,"Walk out with me toward the unknown region,"
waltwhitman,Where neither ground is for the feet nor any path to follow?
waltwhitman,"No map there, nor guide,"
waltwhitman,"Nor voice sounding, nor touch of human hand,"
waltwhitman,"Nor face with blooming flesh, nor lips, nor eyes, are in that land."
waltwhitman,"I know it not O soul,"
waltwhitman,"Nor dost thou, all is a blank before us,"
waltwhitman,"All waits undream'd of in that region, that inaccessible land."
waltwhitman,"Till when the ties loosen,"
waltwhitman,"All but the ties eternal, Time and Space,"
waltwhitman,"Nor darkness, gravitation, sense, nor any bounds bounding us."
waltwhitman,"Then we burst forth, we float,"
waltwhitman,"In Time and Space O soul, prepared for them,"
waltwhitman,"Equal, equipt at last, (O joy! O fruit of all!) them to fulfil O soul."
waltwhitman,Whispers of Heavenly Death
waltwhitman,"Whispers of heavenly death murmur'd I hear,"
waltwhitman,"Labial gossip of night, sibilant chorals,"
waltwhitman,"Footsteps gently ascending, mystical breezes wafted soft and low,"
waltwhitman,"Ripples of unseen rivers, tides of a current flowing, forever flowing,"
waltwhitman,(Or is it the plashing of tears? the measureless waters of human tears?)
waltwhitman,"I see, just see skyward, great cloud-masses,"
waltwhitman,"Mournfully slowly they roll, silently swelling and mixing,"
waltwhitman,"With at times a half-dimm'd sadden'd far-off star,"
waltwhitman,Appearing and disappearing.
waltwhitman,"(Some parturition rather, some solemn immortal birth;"
waltwhitman,"On the frontiers to eyes impenetrable,"
waltwhitman,Some soul is passing over.)

waltwhitman,"Chanting the square deific, out of the One advancing, out of the sides,"
waltwhitman,"Out of the old and new, out of the square entirely divine,"
waltwhitman,"Solid, four-sided, (all the sides needed,) from this side Jehovah am I,"

waltwhitman,"Not Time affects me--I am Time, old, modern as any,"
waltwhitman,"Unpersuadable, relentless, executing righteous judgments,"
waltwhitman,"As the Earth, the Father, the brown old Kronos, with laws,"
waltwhitman,"Aged beyond computation, yet never new, ever with those mighty laws rolling,"
waltwhitman,Relentless I forgive no man--whoever sins dies--I will have that man's life;
waltwhitman,"Therefore let none expect mercy--have the seasons, gravitation, the"
waltwhitman,"appointed days, mercy? no more have I,"
waltwhitman,"But as the seasons and gravitation, and as all the appointed days"
waltwhitman,"that forgive not,"
waltwhitman,I dispense from this side judgments inexorable without the least remorse.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Consolator most mild, the promis'd one advancing,"
waltwhitman,"With gentle hand extended, the mightier God am I,"
waltwhitman,"Foretold by prophets and poets in their most rapt prophecies and poems,"
waltwhitman,"From this side, lo! the Lord Christ gazes--lo! Hermes I--lo! mine is"
waltwhitman,"Hercules' face,"
waltwhitman,"All sorrow, labor, suffering, I, tallying it, absorb in myself,"
waltwhitman,"Many times have I been rejected, taunted, put in prison, and"
waltwhitman,"crucified, and many times shall be again,"
waltwhitman,All the world have I given up for my dear brothers' and sisters'
waltwhitman,"sake, for the soul's sake,"
waltwhitman,"Wanding my way through the homes of men, rich or poor, with the kiss"
waltwhitman,"of affection,"
waltwhitman,"For I am affection, I am the cheer-bringing God, with hope and"
waltwhitman,"all-enclosing charity,"
waltwhitman,"With indulgent words as to children, with fresh and sane words, mine only,"
waltwhitman,Young and strong I pass knowing well I am destin'd myself to an
waltwhitman,early death;
waltwhitman,"But my charity has no death--my wisdom dies not, neither early nor late,"
waltwhitman,And my sweet love bequeath'd here and elsewhere never dies.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"Aloof, dissatisfied, plotting revolt,"
waltwhitman,"Comrade of criminals, brother of slaves,"
waltwhitman,"Crafty, despised, a drudge, ignorant,"
waltwhitman,"With sudra face and worn brow, black, but in the depths of my heart,"
waltwhitman,"proud as any,"
waltwhitman,"Lifted now and always against whoever scorning assumes to rule me,"
waltwhitman,"Morose, full of guile, full of reminiscences, brooding, with many wiles,"
waltwhitman,"(Though it was thought I was baffled, and dispel'd, and my wiles"
waltwhitman,"done, but that will never be,)"
waltwhitman,"Defiant, I, Satan, still live, still utter words, in new lands duly"
waltwhitman,"appearing, (and old ones also,)"
waltwhitman,"Permanent here from my side, warlike, equal with any, real as any,"
waltwhitman,Nor time nor change shall ever change me or my words.

waltwhitman,"Santa Spirita, breather, life,"
waltwhitman,"Beyond the light, lighter than light,"
waltwhitman,"Beyond the flames of hell, joyous, leaping easily above hell,"
waltwhitman,"Beyond Paradise, perfumed solely with mine own perfume,"
waltwhitman,"Including all life on earth, touching, including God, including"
waltwhitman,"Saviour and Satan,"
waltwhitman,"Ethereal, pervading all, (for without me what were all? what were God?)"
waltwhitman,"Essence of forms, life of the real identities, permanent, positive,"
waltwhitman,"(namely the unseen,)"
waltwhitman,"Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man, I, the"
waltwhitman,"general soul,"
waltwhitman,"Here the square finishing, the solid, I the most solid,"
waltwhitman,Breathe my breath also through these songs.
waltwhitman,Of Him I Love Day and Night
waltwhitman,"Of him I love day and night I dream'd I heard he was dead,"
waltwhitman,"And I dream'd I went where they had buried him I love, but he was"
waltwhitman,"not in that place,"
waltwhitman,"And I dream'd I wander'd searching among burial-places to find him,"
waltwhitman,And I found that every place was a burial-place;
waltwhitman,"The houses full of life were equally full of death, (this house is now,)"
waltwhitman,"The streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the Chicago,"
waltwhitman,"Boston, Philadelphia, the Mannahatta, were as full of the dead as"
waltwhitman,"of the living,"
waltwhitman,"And fuller, O vastly fuller of the dead than of the living;"
waltwhitman,"And what I dream'd I will henceforth tell to every person and age,"
waltwhitman,"And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream'd,"
waltwhitman,"And now I am willing to disregard burial-places and dispense with them,"
waltwhitman,"And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere,"
waltwhitman,"even in the room where I eat or sleep, I should be satisfied,"
waltwhitman,"And if the corpse of any one I love, or if my own corpse, be duly"
waltwhitman,"render'd to powder and pour'd in the sea, I shall be satisfied,"
waltwhitman,Or if it be distributed to the winds I shall be satisfied.
waltwhitman,"Yet, Yet, Ye Downcast Hours"
waltwhitman,"Yet, yet, ye downcast hours, I know ye also,"
waltwhitman,"Weights of lead, how ye clog and cling at my ankles,"
waltwhitman,"Earth to a chamber of mourning turns--I hear the o'erweening, mocking"
waltwhitman,"voice,"
waltwhitman,"Matter is conqueror--matter, triumphant only, continues onward."
waltwhitman,"Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me,"
waltwhitman,"The call of my nearest lover, putting forth, alarm'd, uncertain,"
waltwhitman,"The sea I am quickly to sail, come tell me,"
waltwhitman,"Come tell me where I am speeding, tell me my destination."
waltwhitman,"I understand your anguish, but I cannot help you,"
waltwhitman,"I approach, hear, behold, the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes,"
waltwhitman,"your mute inquiry,"
waltwhitman,"Whither I go from the bed I recline on, come tell me,--"
waltwhitman,"Old age, alarm'd, uncertain--a young woman's voice, appealing to"
waltwhitman,me for comfort;
waltwhitman,"A young man's voice, Shall I not escape?"
waltwhitman,As If a Phantom Caress'd Me
waltwhitman,"As if a phantom caress'd me,"
waltwhitman,I thought I was not alone walking here by the shore;
waltwhitman,"But the one I thought was with me as now I walk by the shore, the"
waltwhitman,"one I loved that caress'd me,"
waltwhitman,"As I lean and look through the glimmering light, that one has"
waltwhitman,utterly disappear'd.
waltwhitman,And those appear that are hateful to me and mock me.
waltwhitman,Assurances
waltwhitman,"I need no assurances, I am a man who is preoccupied of his own soul;"
waltwhitman,I do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and
waltwhitman,"face I am cognizant of, are now looking faces I am not cognizant"
waltwhitman,"of, calm and actual faces,"
waltwhitman,I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in
waltwhitman,"any iota of the world,"
waltwhitman,"I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes are limitless,"
waltwhitman,"in vain I try to think how limitless,"
waltwhitman,I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their
waltwhitman,"swift sports through the air on purpose, and that I shall one day"
waltwhitman,"be eligible to do as much as they, and more than they,"
waltwhitman,"I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of years,"
waltwhitman,"I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors have"
waltwhitman,"their exteriors, and that the eyesight has another eyesight, and"
waltwhitman,"the hearing another hearing, and the voice another voice,"
waltwhitman,I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of young men are
waltwhitman,"provided for, and that the deaths of young women and the"
waltwhitman,"deaths of little children are provided for,"
waltwhitman,"(Did you think Life was so well provided for, and Death, the purport"
waltwhitman,"of all Life, is not well provided for?)"
waltwhitman,"I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter what the horrors of"
waltwhitman,"them, no matter whose wife, child, husband, father, lover, has"
waltwhitman,"gone down, are provided for, to the minutest points,"
waltwhitman,I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any
waltwhitman,"time, is provided for in the inherences of things,"
waltwhitman,"I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space, but I"
waltwhitman,believe Heavenly Death provides for all.
waltwhitman,Quicksand Years
waltwhitman,"Quicksand years that whirl me I know not whither,"
waltwhitman,"Your schemes, politics, fail, lines give way, substances mock and elude me,"
waltwhitman,"Only the theme I sing, the great and strong-possess'd soul, eludes not,"
waltwhitman,One's-self must never give way--that is the final substance--that
waltwhitman,"out of all is sure,"
waltwhitman,"Out of politics, triumphs, battles, life, what at last finally remains?"
waltwhitman,When shows break up what but One's-Self is sure?
waltwhitman,That Music Always Round Me
waltwhitman,"That music always round me, unceasing, unbeginning, yet long"
waltwhitman,"untaught I did not hear,"
waltwhitman,"But now the chorus I hear and am elated,"
waltwhitman,"A tenor, strong, ascending with power and health, with glad notes of"
waltwhitman,"daybreak I hear,"
waltwhitman,"A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves,"
waltwhitman,"A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe,"
waltwhitman,"The triumphant tutti, the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and"
waltwhitman,"violins, all these I fill myself with,"
waltwhitman,"I hear not the volumes of sound merely, I am moved by the exquisite"
waltwhitman,"meanings,"
waltwhitman,"I listen to the different voices winding in and out, striving,"
waltwhitman,contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion;
waltwhitman,I do not think the performers know themselves--but now I think
waltwhitman,begin to know them.
waltwhitman,What Ship Puzzled at Sea
waltwhitman,"What ship puzzled at sea, cons for the true reckoning?"
waltwhitman,"Or coming in, to avoid the bars and follow the channel a perfect"
waltwhitman,pilot needs?
waltwhitman,"Here, sailor! here, ship! take aboard the most perfect pilot,"
waltwhitman,"Whom, in a little boat, putting off and rowing, I hailing you offer."
waltwhitman,A Noiseless Patient Spider
waltwhitman,"A noiseless patient spider,"
waltwhitman,"I mark'd where on a little promontory it stood isolated,"
waltwhitman,"Mark'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,"
waltwhitman,"It launch'd forth filament, filament, filament out of itself,"
waltwhitman,"Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them."
waltwhitman,"And you O my soul where you stand,"
waltwhitman,"Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,"
waltwhitman,"Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to"
waltwhitman,"connect them,"
waltwhitman,"Till the bridge you will need be form'd, till the ductile anchor hold,"
waltwhitman,"Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul."
waltwhitman,"O Living Always, Always Dying"
waltwhitman,"O living always, always dying!"
waltwhitman,"O the burials of me past and present,"
waltwhitman,"O me while I stride ahead, material, visible, imperious as ever;"
waltwhitman,"O me, what I was for years, now dead, (I lament not, I am content;)"
waltwhitman,"O to disengage myself from those corpses of me, which I turn and"
waltwhitman,"look at where I cast them,"
waltwhitman,"To pass on, (O living! always living!) and leave the corpses behind."
waltwhitman,To One Shortly to Die
waltwhitman,"From all the rest I single out you, having a message for you,"
waltwhitman,"You are to die--let others tell you what they please, I cannot prevaricate,"
waltwhitman,"I am exact and merciless, but I love you--there is no escape for you."
waltwhitman,"Softly I lay my right hand upon you, you 'ust feel it,"
waltwhitman,"I do not argue, I bend my head close and half envelop it,"
waltwhitman,"I sit quietly by, I remain faithful,"
waltwhitman,"I am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbor,"
waltwhitman,"I absolve you from all except yourself spiritual bodily, that is"
waltwhitman,"eternal, you yourself will surely escape,"
waltwhitman,The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious.
waltwhitman,"The sun bursts through in unlooked-for directions,"
waltwhitman,"Strong thoughts fill you and confidence, you smile,"
waltwhitman,"You forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick,"
waltwhitman,"You do not see the medicines, you do not mind the weeping friends,"
waltwhitman,"I am with you,"
waltwhitman,"I exclude others from you, there is nothing to be commiserated,"
waltwhitman,"I do not commiserate, I congratulate you."
waltwhitman,Night on the Prairies
waltwhitman,"Night on the prairies,"
waltwhitman,"The supper is over, the fire on the ground burns low,"
waltwhitman,"The wearied emigrants sleep, wrapt in their blankets;"
waltwhitman,"I walk by myself--I stand and look at the stars, which I think now"
waltwhitman,never realized before.
waltwhitman,"Now I absorb immortality and peace,"
waltwhitman,I admire death and test propositions.
waltwhitman,How plenteous! how spiritual! how resume!
waltwhitman,"The same old man and soul--the same old aspirations, and the same content."
waltwhitman,"I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the not-day exhibited,"
waltwhitman,I was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so noiseless
waltwhitman,around me myriads of other globes.
waltwhitman,Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I will
waltwhitman,"measure myself by them,"
waltwhitman,And now touch'd with the lives of other globes arrived as far along
waltwhitman,"as those of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"Or waiting to arrive, or pass'd on farther than those of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,"
waltwhitman,"Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive."
waltwhitman,"O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me, as the day cannot,"
waltwhitman,I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.
waltwhitman,Thought
waltwhitman,"As I sit with others at a great feast, suddenly while the music is playing,"
waltwhitman,"To my mind, (whence it comes I know not,) spectral in mist of a"
waltwhitman,"wreck at sea,"
waltwhitman,"Of certain ships, how they sail from port with flying streamers and"
waltwhitman,"wafted kisses, and that is the last of them,"
waltwhitman,"Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President,"
waltwhitman,Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founder'd
waltwhitman,off the Northeast coast and going down--of the steamship Arctic
waltwhitman,"going down,"
waltwhitman,"Of the veil'd tableau-women gather'd together on deck, pale, heroic,"
waltwhitman,waiting the moment that draws so close--O the moment!
waltwhitman,A huge sob--a few bubbles--the white foam spirting up--and then the
waltwhitman,"women gone,"
waltwhitman,Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on--and I now
waltwhitman,"pondering, Are those women indeed gone?"
waltwhitman,Are souls drown'd and destroy'd so?
waltwhitman,Is only matter triumphant?
waltwhitman,The Last Invocation
waltwhitman,"At the last, tenderly,"
waltwhitman,"From the walls of the powerful fortress'd house,"
waltwhitman,"From the clasp of the knitted locks, from the keep of the well-closed doors,"
waltwhitman,Let me be wafted.
waltwhitman,Let me glide noiselessly forth;
waltwhitman,"With the key of softness unlock the locks--with a whisper,"
waltwhitman,Set ope the doors O soul.
waltwhitman,"Tenderly--be not impatient,"
waltwhitman,"(Strong is your hold O mortal flesh,"
waltwhitman,Strong is your hold O love.)
waltwhitman,As I Watch the Ploughman Ploughing
waltwhitman,"As I watch'd the ploughman ploughing,"
waltwhitman,"Or the sower sowing in the fields, or the harvester harvesting,"
waltwhitman,"I saw there too, O life and death, your analogies;"
waltwhitman,"(Life, life is the tillage, and Death is the harvest according.)"
waltwhitman,Pensive and Faltering
waltwhitman,"Pensive and faltering,"
waltwhitman,"The words the Dead I write,"
waltwhitman,"For living are the Dead,"
waltwhitman,"(Haply the only living, only real,"
waltwhitman,"And I the apparition, I the spectre.)"
waltwhitman,BOOK XXXI
waltwhitman,Thou Mother with Thy Equal Brood
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Thou Mother with thy equal brood,"
waltwhitman,"Thou varied chain of different States, yet one identity only,"
waltwhitman,"A special song before I go I'd sing o'er all the rest,"
waltwhitman,"For thee, the future."
waltwhitman,"I'd sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,"
waltwhitman,"I'd fashion thy ensemble including body and soul,"
waltwhitman,"I'd show away ahead thy real Union, and how it may be accomplish'd."
waltwhitman,"The paths to the house I seek to make,"
waltwhitman,But leave to those to come the house itself.
waltwhitman,"Belief I sing, and preparation;"
waltwhitman,"As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present only,"
waltwhitman,"But greater still from what is yet to come,"
waltwhitman,Out of that formula for thee I sing.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"As a strong bird on pinions free,"
waltwhitman,"Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,"
waltwhitman,"Such be the thought I'd think of thee America,"
waltwhitman,Such be the recitative I'd bring for thee.
waltwhitman,"The conceits of the poets of other lands I'd bring thee not,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,"
waltwhitman,"Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of foreign court or indoor"
waltwhitman,library;
waltwhitman,"But an odor I'd bring as from forests of pine in Maine, or breath of"
waltwhitman,"an Illinois prairie,"
waltwhitman,"With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee, or from Texas"
waltwhitman,"uplands, or Florida's glades,"
waltwhitman,"Or the Saguenay's black stream, or the wide blue spread of Huron,"
waltwhitman,"With presentment of Yellowstone's scenes, or Yosemite,"
waltwhitman,"And murmuring under, pervading all, I'd bring the rustling sea-sound,"
waltwhitman,That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world.
waltwhitman,"And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,"
waltwhitman,"Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, mind-formulas fitted"
waltwhitman,"for thee, real and sane and large as these and thee,"

waltwhitman,"Brain of the New World, what a task is thine,"
waltwhitman,"To formulate the Modern--out of the peerless grandeur of the modern,"
waltwhitman,"Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast poems, churches, art,"
waltwhitman,"(Recast, may-be discard them, end them--maybe their work is done,"
waltwhitman,who knows?)
waltwhitman,"By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the mighty past, the dead,"
waltwhitman,To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present.
waltwhitman,"And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old World brain,"
waltwhitman,"Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long,"
waltwhitman,"Thou carefully prepared by it so long--haply thou but unfoldest it,"
waltwhitman,"only maturest it,"
waltwhitman,"It to eventuate in thee--the essence of the by-gone time contain'd in thee,"
waltwhitman,"Its poems, churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, destined with"

waltwhitman,"ankle-deep in the water, pois'd on strong legs,"
waltwhitman,"The boats partly drawn up, the water slapping against them,"
waltwhitman,"Strew'd on the sand in heaps and windrows, well out from the water,"
waltwhitman,the green-back'd spotted mossbonkers.
waltwhitman,BOOK XXXII.  FROM NOON TO STARRY NIGHT
waltwhitman,Thou Orb Aloft Full-Dazzling
waltwhitman,Thou orb aloft full-dazzling! thou hot October noon!
waltwhitman,"Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand,"
waltwhitman,"The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam,"
waltwhitman,And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue;
waltwhitman,O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.
waltwhitman,Hear me illustrious!
waltwhitman,"Thy lover me, for always I have loved thee,"
waltwhitman,"Even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some wood edge, thy"
waltwhitman,"touching-distant beams enough,"
waltwhitman,"Or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation."
waltwhitman,"(Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive,"
waltwhitman,"I know before the fitting man all Nature yields,"
waltwhitman,"Though answering not in words, the skies, trees, hear his voice--and"
waltwhitman,"thou O sun,"
waltwhitman,"As for thy throes, thy perturbations, sudden breaks and shafts of"
waltwhitman,"flame gigantic,"
waltwhitman,"I understand them, I know those flames, those perturbations well.)"
waltwhitman,"Thou that with fructifying heat and light,"
waltwhitman,"O'er myriad farms, o'er lands and waters North and South,"
waltwhitman,"O'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas' grassy plains,"
waltwhitman,"Kanada's woods,"
waltwhitman,"O'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space,"
waltwhitman,"Thou that impartially enfoldest all, not only continents, seas,"
waltwhitman,"Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally,"
waltwhitman,"Shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting ray out of"
waltwhitman,"thy million millions,"
waltwhitman,Strike through these chants.
waltwhitman,"Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these,"
waltwhitman,"Prepare the later afternoon of me myself--prepare my lengthening shadows,"
waltwhitman,Prepare my starry nights.
waltwhitman,Faces
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Sauntering the pavement or riding the country by-road, faces!"
waltwhitman,"Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality,"
waltwhitman,"The spiritual-prescient face, the always welcome common benevolent face,"
waltwhitman,"The face of the singing of music, the grand faces of natural lawyers"
waltwhitman,"and judges broad at the back-top,"
waltwhitman,"The faces of hunters and fishers bulged at the brows, the shaved"
waltwhitman,"blanch'd faces of orthodox citizens,"
waltwhitman,"The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist's face,"
waltwhitman,"The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the handsome detested or"
waltwhitman,"despised face,"
waltwhitman,"The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the mother of"
waltwhitman,"many children,"
waltwhitman,"The face of an amour, the face of veneration,"
waltwhitman,"The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock,"
waltwhitman,"The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated face,"
waltwhitman,"A wild hawk, his wings clipp'd by the clipper,"
waltwhitman,A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of the gelder.
waltwhitman,"Sauntering the pavement thus, or crossing the ceaseless ferry, faces"
waltwhitman,"and faces and faces,"
waltwhitman,"I see them and complain not, and am content with all."
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,Do you suppose I could be content with all if I thought them their
waltwhitman,own finale?
waltwhitman,"This now is too lamentable a face for a man,"
waltwhitman,"Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing for it,"
waltwhitman,Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig to its hole.
waltwhitman,"This face is a dog's snout sniffing for garbage,"
waltwhitman,"Snakes nest in that mouth, I hear the sibilant threat."
waltwhitman,"This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea,"
waltwhitman,Its sleepy and wobbling icebergs crunch as they go.
waltwhitman,"This is a face of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they need no label,"
waltwhitman,"And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc, or hog's-lard."
waltwhitman,"This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry,"
waltwhitman,"Its veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till they show"
waltwhitman,"nothing but their whites,"
waltwhitman,"Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by the turn'd-in nails,"
waltwhitman,"The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground, while he"
waltwhitman,speculates well.
waltwhitman,"This face is bitten by vermin and worms,"
waltwhitman,And this is some murderer's knife with a half-pull'd scabbard.
waltwhitman,"This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee,"
waltwhitman,An unceasing death-bell tolls there.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,Features of my equals would you trick me with your creas'd and
waltwhitman,cadaverous march?
waltwhitman,"Well, you cannot trick me."
waltwhitman,"I see your rounded never-erased flow,"
waltwhitman,I see 'neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises.
waltwhitman,"Splay and twist as you like, poke with the tangling fores of fishes or rats,"
waltwhitman,"You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will."
waltwhitman,I saw the face of the most smear'd and slobbering idiot they had at
waltwhitman,"the asylum,"
waltwhitman,"And I knew for my consolation what they knew not,"
waltwhitman,"I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother,"
waltwhitman,"The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement,"
waltwhitman,"And I shall look again in a score or two of ages,"
waltwhitman,"And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and unharm'd, every inch"
waltwhitman,as good as myself.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"The Lord advances, and yet advances,"
waltwhitman,"Always the shadow in front, always the reach'd hand bringing up the"
waltwhitman,laggards.
waltwhitman,"Out of this face emerge banners and horses--O superb! I see what is coming,"
waltwhitman,"I see the high pioneer-caps, see staves of runners clearing the way,"
waltwhitman,I hear victorious drums.
waltwhitman,"This face is a life-boat,"
waltwhitman,"This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no odds of the rest,"
waltwhitman,"This face is flavor'd fruit ready for eating,"
waltwhitman,This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good.
waltwhitman,"These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake,"
waltwhitman,They show their descent from the Master himself.
waltwhitman,"Off the word I have spoken I except not one--red, white, black, are"
waltwhitman,"all deific,"
waltwhitman,"In each house is the ovum, it comes forth after a thousand years."
waltwhitman,"Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me,"
waltwhitman,"Tall and sufficient stand behind and make signs to me,"
waltwhitman,I read the promise and patiently wait.
waltwhitman,"This is a full-grown lily's face,"
waltwhitman,"She speaks to the limber-hipp'd man near the garden pickets,"
waltwhitman,"Come here she blushingly cries, Come nigh to me limber-hipp'd man,"
waltwhitman,"Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon you,"
waltwhitman,"Fill me with albescent honey, bend down to me,"
waltwhitman,"Rub to me with your chafing beard, rub to my breast and shoulders."
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"The old face of the mother of many children,"
waltwhitman,Whist! I am fully content.
waltwhitman,"Lull'd and late is the smoke of the First-day morning,"
waltwhitman,"It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences,"
waltwhitman,It hangs thin by the sassafras and wild-cherry and cat-brier under them.
waltwhitman,"I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,"
waltwhitman,"I heard what the singers were singing so long,"
waltwhitman,Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and the water-blue.
waltwhitman,Behold a woman!
waltwhitman,"She looks out from her quaker cap, her face is clearer and more"
waltwhitman,beautiful than the sky.
waltwhitman,"She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse,"
waltwhitman,The sun just shines on her old white head.
waltwhitman,"Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen,"
waltwhitman,"Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-daughters spun it with"
waltwhitman,the distaff and the wheel.
waltwhitman,"The melodious character of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish to go,"
waltwhitman,The justified mother of men.
waltwhitman,The Mystic Trumpeter
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Hark, some wild trumpeter, some strange musician,"
waltwhitman,"Hovering unseen in air, vibrates capricious tunes to-night."
waltwhitman,"I hear thee trumpeter, listening alert I catch thy notes,"
waltwhitman,"Now pouring, whirling like a tempest round me,"
waltwhitman,"Now low, subdued, now in the distance lost."
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Come nearer bodiless one, haply in thee resounds"
waltwhitman,"Some dead composer, haply thy pensive life"
waltwhitman,"Was fill'd with aspirations high, unform'd ideals,"
waltwhitman,"Waves, oceans musical, chaotically surging,"
waltwhitman,"That now ecstatic ghost, close to me bending, thy cornet echoing, pealing,"
waltwhitman,"Gives out to no one's ears but mine, but freely gives to mine,"
waltwhitman,That I may thee translate.
waltwhitman,3
waltwhitman,"Blow trumpeter free and clear, I follow thee,"
waltwhitman,"While at thy liquid prelude, glad, serene,"
waltwhitman,"The fretting world, the streets, the noisy hours of day withdraw,"
waltwhitman,"A holy calm descends like dew upon me,"
waltwhitman,"I walk in cool refreshing night the walks of Paradise,"
waltwhitman,"I scent the grass, the moist air and the roses;"
waltwhitman,"Thy song expands my numb'd imbonded spirit, thou freest, launchest me,"
waltwhitman,Floating and basking upon heaven's lake.
waltwhitman,4
waltwhitman,"Blow again trumpeter! and for my sensuous eyes,"
waltwhitman,"Bring the old pageants, show the feudal world."
waltwhitman,"What charm thy music works! thou makest pass before me,"
waltwhitman,"Ladies and cavaliers long dead, barons are in their castle halls,"
waltwhitman,"the troubadours are singing,"
waltwhitman,"Arm'd knights go forth to redress wrongs, some in quest of the holy Graal;"
waltwhitman,"I see the tournament, I see the contestants incased in heavy armor"
waltwhitman,"seated on stately champing horses,"
waltwhitman,"I hear the shouts, the sounds of blows and smiting steel;"
waltwhitman,"I see the Crusaders' tumultuous armies--hark, how the cymbals clang,"
waltwhitman,"Lo, where the monks walk in advance, bearing the cross on high."
waltwhitman,5
waltwhitman,"Blow again trumpeter! and for thy theme,"
waltwhitman,"Take now the enclosing theme of all, the solvent and the setting,"
waltwhitman,"Love, that is pulse of all, the sustenance and the pang,"
waltwhitman,"The heart of man and woman all for love,"
waltwhitman,"No other theme but love--knitting, enclosing, all-diffusing love."
waltwhitman,O how the immortal phantoms crowd around me!
waltwhitman,"I see the vast alembic ever working, I see and know the flames that"
waltwhitman,"heat the world,"
waltwhitman,"The glow, the blush, the beating hearts of lovers,"
waltwhitman,"So blissful happy some, and some so silent, dark, and nigh to death;"
waltwhitman,"Love, that is all the earth to lovers--love, that mocks time and space,"
waltwhitman,"Love, that is day and night--love, that is sun and moon and stars,"
waltwhitman,"Love, that is crimson, sumptuous, sick with perfume,"
waltwhitman,"No other words but words of love, no other thought but love."
waltwhitman,6
waltwhitman,Blow again trumpeter--conjure war's alarums.
waltwhitman,"Swift to thy spell a shuddering hum like distant thunder rolls,"
waltwhitman,"Lo, where the arm'd men hasten--lo, mid the clouds of dust the glint"
waltwhitman,"of bayonets,"
waltwhitman,"I see the grime-faced cannoneers, I mark the rosy flash amid the"
waltwhitman,"smoke, I hear the cracking of the guns;"
waltwhitman,"Nor war alone--thy fearful music-song, wild player, brings every"
waltwhitman,"sight of fear,"
waltwhitman,"The deeds of ruthless brigands, rapine, murder--I hear the cries for help!"
waltwhitman,"I see ships foundering at sea, I behold on deck and below deck the"
waltwhitman,terrible tableaus.
waltwhitman,7
waltwhitman,"O trumpeter, methinks I am myself the instrument thou playest,"
waltwhitman,"Thou melt'st my heart, my brain--thou movest, drawest, changest"
waltwhitman,them at will;
waltwhitman,"And now thy sullen notes send darkness through me,"
waltwhitman,"Thou takest away all cheering light, all hope,"
waltwhitman,"I see the enslaved, the overthrown, the hurt, the opprest of the"
waltwhitman,"whole earth,"
waltwhitman,"I feel the measureless shame and humiliation of my race, it becomes"
waltwhitman,"all mine,"
waltwhitman,"Mine too the revenges of humanity, the wrongs of ages, baffled feuds"
waltwhitman,"and hatreds,"
waltwhitman,"Utter defeat upon me weighs--all lost--the foe victorious,"
waltwhitman,"(Yet 'mid the ruins Pride colossal stands unshaken to the last,"
waltwhitman,"Endurance, resolution to the last.)"
waltwhitman,8
waltwhitman,"Now trumpeter for thy close,"
waltwhitman,"Vouchsafe a higher strain than any yet,"
waltwhitman,"Sing to my soul, renew its languishing faith and hope,"
waltwhitman,"Rouse up my slow belief, give me some vision of the future,"
waltwhitman,Give me for once its prophecy and joy.
waltwhitman,"O glad, exulting, culminating song!"
waltwhitman,"A vigor more than earth's is in thy notes,"
waltwhitman,"Marches of victory--man disenthral'd--the conqueror at last,"
waltwhitman,Hymns to the universal God from universal man--all joy!
waltwhitman,"A reborn race appears--a perfect world, all joy!"
waltwhitman,Women and men in wisdom innocence and health--all joy!
waltwhitman,Riotous laughing bacchanals fill'd with joy!
waltwhitman,"War, sorrow, suffering gone--the rank earth purged--nothing but joy left!"
waltwhitman,The ocean fill'd with joy--the atmosphere all joy!
waltwhitman,"Joy! joy! in freedom, worship, love! joy in the ecstasy of life!"
waltwhitman,Enough to merely be! enough to breathe!
waltwhitman,Joy! joy! all over joy!
waltwhitman,To a Locomotive in Winter
waltwhitman,"Thee for my recitative,"
waltwhitman,"Thee in the driving storm even as now, the snow, the winter-day declining,"
waltwhitman,"Thee in thy panoply, thy measur'd dual throbbing and thy beat convulsive,"
waltwhitman,"Thy black cylindric body, golden brass and silvery steel,"
waltwhitman,"Thy ponderous side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, gyrating,"
waltwhitman,"shuttling at thy sides,"
waltwhitman,"Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar, now tapering in the distance,"
waltwhitman,"Thy great protruding head-light fix'd in front,"
waltwhitman,"Thy long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate purple,"
waltwhitman,"The dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy smoke-stack,"
waltwhitman,"Thy knitted frame, thy springs and valves, the tremulous twinkle of"
waltwhitman,"thy wheels,"
waltwhitman,"Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily following,"
waltwhitman,"Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily careering;"
waltwhitman,"Type of the modern--emblem of motion and power--pulse of the continent,"
waltwhitman,"For once come serve the Muse and merge in verse, even as here I see thee,"
waltwhitman,"With storm and buffeting gusts of wind and falling snow,"
waltwhitman,"By day thy warning ringing bell to sound its notes,"
waltwhitman,By night thy silent signal lamps to swing.
waltwhitman,Fierce-throated beauty!
waltwhitman,"Roll through my chant with all thy lawless music, thy swinging lamps"
waltwhitman,"at night,"
waltwhitman,"Thy madly-whistled laughter, echoing, rumbling like an earthquake,"
waltwhitman,"rousing all,"
waltwhitman,"Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding,"
waltwhitman,"(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine,)"
waltwhitman,"Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,"
waltwhitman,"Launch'd o'er the prairies wide, across the lakes,"
waltwhitman,To the free skies unpent and glad and strong.
waltwhitman,O Magnet-South
waltwhitman,O magnet-south! O glistening perfumed South! my South!
waltwhitman,"O quick mettle, rich blood, impulse and love! good and evil! O all"
waltwhitman,dear to me!
waltwhitman,O dear to me my birth-things--all moving things and the trees where
waltwhitman,"I was born--the grains, plants, rivers,"
waltwhitman,"Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow, distant,"
waltwhitman,"over flats of slivery sands or through swamps,"
waltwhitman,"Dear to me the Roanoke, the Savannah, the Altamahaw, the Pedee, the"
waltwhitman,"Tombigbee, the Santee, the Coosa and the Sabine,"
waltwhitman,"O pensive, far away wandering, I return with my soul to haunt their"
waltwhitman,"banks again,"
waltwhitman,"Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes, I float on the"
waltwhitman,"Okeechobee, I cross the hummock-land or through pleasant openings"
waltwhitman,"or dense forests,"
waltwhitman,"I see the parrots in the woods, I see the papaw-tree and the"
waltwhitman,blossoming titi;
waltwhitman,"Again, sailing in my coaster on deck, I coast off Georgia, I coast"
waltwhitman,"up the Carolinas,"
waltwhitman,"I see where the live-oak is growing, I see where the yellow-pine,"
waltwhitman,"the scented bay-tree, the lemon and orange, the cypress, the"
waltwhitman,"graceful palmetto,"
waltwhitman,"I pass rude sea-headlands and enter Pamlico sound through an inlet,"
waltwhitman,and dart my vision inland;
waltwhitman,"O the cotton plant! the growing fields of rice, sugar, hemp!"
waltwhitman,"The cactus guarded with thorns, the laurel-tree with large white flowers,"
waltwhitman,"The range afar, the richness and barrenness, the old woods charged"
waltwhitman,"with mistletoe and trailing moss,"
waltwhitman,"The piney odor and the gloom, the awful natural stillness, (here in"
waltwhitman,"these dense swamps the freebooter carries his gun, and the"
waltwhitman,fugitive has his conceal'd hut;)
waltwhitman,O the strange fascination of these half-known half-impassable
waltwhitman,"swamps, infested by reptiles, resounding with the bellow of the"
waltwhitman,"alligator, the sad noises of the night-owl and the wild-cat, and"
waltwhitman,"the whirr of the rattlesnake,"
waltwhitman,"The mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing all the forenoon,"
waltwhitman,"singing through the moon-lit night,"
waltwhitman,"The humming-bird, the wild turkey, the raccoon, the opossum;"
waltwhitman,"A Kentucky corn-field, the tall, graceful, long-leav'd corn,"
waltwhitman,"slender, flapping, bright green, with tassels, with beautiful"
waltwhitman,ears each well-sheath'd in its husk;
waltwhitman,"O my heart! O tender and fierce pangs, I can stand them not, I will depart;"
waltwhitman,O to be a Virginian where I grew up! O to be a Carolinian!
waltwhitman,O longings irrepressible! O I will go back to old Tennessee and
waltwhitman,never wander more.
waltwhitman,Mannahatta
waltwhitman,"I was asking for something specific and perfect for my city,"
waltwhitman,Whereupon lo! upsprang the aboriginal name.
waltwhitman,"Now I see what there is in a name, a word, liquid, sane, unruly,"
waltwhitman,"musical, self-sufficient,"
waltwhitman,"I see that the word of my city is that word from of old,"
waltwhitman,"Because I see that word nested in nests of water-bays, superb,"
waltwhitman,"Rich, hemm'd thick all around with sailships and steamships, an"
waltwhitman,"island sixteen miles long, solid-founded,"
waltwhitman,"Numberless crowded streets, high growths of iron, slender, strong,"
waltwhitman,"light, splendidly uprising toward clear skies,"
waltwhitman,"Tides swift and ample, well-loved by me, toward sundown,"
waltwhitman,"The flowing sea-currents, the little islands, larger adjoining"
waltwhitman,"islands, the heights, the villas,"
waltwhitman,"The countless masts, the white shore-steamers, the lighters, the"
waltwhitman,"ferry-boats, the black sea-steamers well-model'd,"
waltwhitman,"The down-town streets, the jobbers' houses of business, the houses"
waltwhitman,"of business of the ship-merchants and money-brokers, the river-streets,"
waltwhitman,"Immigrants arriving, fifteen or twenty thousand in a week,"
waltwhitman,"The carts hauling goods, the manly race of drivers of horses, the"
waltwhitman,"brown-faced sailors,"
waltwhitman,"The summer air, the bright sun shining, and the sailing clouds aloft,"
waltwhitman,"The winter snows, the sleigh-bells, the broken ice in the river,"
waltwhitman,"passing along up or down with the flood-tide or ebb-tide,"
waltwhitman,"The mechanics of the city, the masters, well-form'd,"
waltwhitman,"beautiful-faced, looking you straight in the eyes,"
waltwhitman,"Trottoirs throng'd, vehicles, Broadway, the women, the shops and shows,"
waltwhitman,A million people--manners free and superb--open voices--hospitality--
waltwhitman,"the most courageous and friendly young men,"
waltwhitman,City of hurried and sparkling waters! city of spires and masts!
waltwhitman,City nested in bays! my city!
waltwhitman,All Is Truth
waltwhitman,"O me, man of slack faith so long,"
waltwhitman,"Standing aloof, denying portions so long,"
waltwhitman,"Only aware to-day of compact all-diffused truth,"
waltwhitman,"Discovering to-day there is no lie or form of lie, and can be none,"
waltwhitman,"but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon itself,"
waltwhitman,Or as any law of the earth or any natural production of the earth does.
waltwhitman,"(This is curious and may not be realized immediately, but it must be"
waltwhitman,"realized,"
waltwhitman,"I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally with the rest,"
waltwhitman,And that the universe does.)
waltwhitman,Where has fail'd a perfect return indifferent of lies or the truth?
waltwhitman,"Is it upon the ground, or in water or fire? or in the spirit of man?"
waltwhitman,or in the meat and blood?
waltwhitman,"Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself, I see"
waltwhitman,"that there are really no liars or lies after all,"
waltwhitman,"And that nothing fails its perfect return, and that what are called"
waltwhitman,"lies are perfect returns,"
waltwhitman,"And that each thing exactly represents itself and what has preceded it,"
waltwhitman,"And that the truth includes all, and is compact just as much as"
waltwhitman,"space is compact,"
waltwhitman,And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truth--but
waltwhitman,that all is truth without exception;
waltwhitman,"And henceforth I will go celebrate any thing I see or am,"
waltwhitman,And sing and laugh and deny nothing.
waltwhitman,A Riddle Song
waltwhitman,"That which eludes this verse and any verse,"
waltwhitman,"Unheard by sharpest ear, unform'd in clearest eye or cunningest mind,"
waltwhitman,"Nor lore nor fame, nor happiness nor wealth,"
waltwhitman,"And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world incessantly,"
waltwhitman,"Which you and I and all pursuing ever ever miss,"
waltwhitman,"Open but still a secret, the real of the real, an illusion,"
waltwhitman,"Costless, vouchsafed to each, yet never man the owner,"
waltwhitman,"Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme, historians in prose,"
waltwhitman,"Which sculptor never chisel'd yet, nor painter painted,"
waltwhitman,"Which vocalist never sung, nor orator nor actor ever utter'd,"
waltwhitman,Invoking here and now I challenge for my song.
waltwhitman,"Indifferently, 'mid public, private haunts, in solitude,"
waltwhitman,"Behind the mountain and the wood,"
waltwhitman,"Companion of the city's busiest streets, through the assemblage,"
waltwhitman,It and its radiations constantly glide.
waltwhitman,"In looks of fair unconscious babes,"
waltwhitman,"Or strangely in the coffin'd dead,"
waltwhitman,"Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night,"
waltwhitman,"As some dissolving delicate film of dreams,"
waltwhitman,Hiding yet lingering.
waltwhitman,"Two little breaths of words comprising it,"
waltwhitman,"Two words, yet all from first to last comprised in it."
waltwhitman,How ardently for it!
waltwhitman,How many ships have sail'd and sunk for it!
waltwhitman,How many travelers started from their homes and neer return'd!
waltwhitman,How much of genius boldly staked and lost for it!
waltwhitman,"What countless stores of beauty, love, ventur'd for it!"
waltwhitman,How all superbest deeds since Time began are traceable to it--and
waltwhitman,shall be to the end!
waltwhitman,How all heroic martyrdoms to it!
waltwhitman,"How, justified by it, the horrors, evils, battles of the earth!"
waltwhitman,"How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it, in every age and"
waltwhitman,"land, have drawn men's eyes,"
waltwhitman,"Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast, the sky, the islands, and the cliffs,"
waltwhitman,Or midnight's silent glowing northern lights unreachable.
waltwhitman,"Haply God's riddle it, so vague and yet so certain,"
waltwhitman,"The soul for it, and all the visible universe for it,"
waltwhitman,And heaven at last for it.
waltwhitman,Excelsior
waltwhitman,"Who has gone farthest? for I would go farther,"
waltwhitman,"And who has been just? for I would be the most just person of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"And who most cautious? for I would be more cautious,"
waltwhitman,And who has been happiest? O I think it is I--I think no one was
waltwhitman,"ever happier than I,"
waltwhitman,"And who has lavish'd all? for I lavish constantly the best I have,"
waltwhitman,And who proudest? for I think I have reason to be the proudest son
waltwhitman,"alive--for I am the son of the brawny and tall-topt city,"
waltwhitman,And who has been bold and true? for I would be the boldest and
waltwhitman,"truest being of the universe,"
waltwhitman,"And who benevolent? for I would show more benevolence than all the rest,"
waltwhitman,And who has receiv'd the love of the most friends? for I know what
waltwhitman,"it is to receive the passionate love of many friends,"
waltwhitman,And who possesses a perfect and enamour'd body? for I do not believe
waltwhitman,"any one possesses a more perfect or enamour'd body than mine,"
waltwhitman,"And who thinks the amplest thoughts? for I would surround those thoughts,"
waltwhitman,And who has made hymns fit for the earth? for I am mad with
waltwhitman,devouring ecstasy to make joyous hymns for the whole earth.
waltwhitman,"Ah Poverties, Wincings, and Sulky Retreats"
waltwhitman,"Ah poverties, wincings, and sulky retreats,"
waltwhitman,"Ah you foes that in conflict have overcome me,"
waltwhitman,"(For what is my life or any man's life but a conflict with foes, the"
waltwhitman,"old, the incessant war?)"
waltwhitman,"You degradations, you tussle with passions and appetites,"
waltwhitman,"You smarts from dissatisfied friendships, (ah wounds the sharpest of all!)"
waltwhitman,"You toil of painful and choked articulations, you meannesses,"
waltwhitman,"You shallow tongue-talks at tables, (my tongue the shallowest of any;)"
waltwhitman,"You broken resolutions, you racking angers, you smother'd ennuis!"
waltwhitman,"Ah think not you finally triumph, my real self has yet to come forth,"
waltwhitman,"It shall yet march forth o'ermastering, till all lies beneath me,"
waltwhitman,It shall yet stand up the soldier of ultimate victory.
waltwhitman,Thoughts
waltwhitman,"Of public opinion,"
waltwhitman,"Of a calm and cool fiat sooner or later, (how impassive! how certain"
waltwhitman,and final!)
waltwhitman,"Of the President with pale face asking secretly to himself, What"
waltwhitman,will the people say at last?
waltwhitman,"Of the frivolous Judge--of the corrupt Congressman, Governor,"
waltwhitman,"Mayor--of such as these standing helpless and exposed,"
waltwhitman,"Of the mumbling and screaming priest, (soon, soon deserted,)"
waltwhitman,"Of the lessening year by year of venerableness, and of the dicta of"
waltwhitman,"officers, statutes, pulpits, schools,"
waltwhitman,Of the rising forever taller and stronger and broader of the
waltwhitman,"intuitions of men and women, and of Self-esteem and Personality;"
waltwhitman,"Of the true New World--of the Democracies resplendent en-masse,"
waltwhitman,"Of the conformity of politics, armies, navies, to them,"
waltwhitman,"Of the shining sun by them--of the inherent light, greater than the rest,"
waltwhitman,"Of the envelopment of all by them, and the effusion of all from them."
waltwhitman,Mediums
waltwhitman,"They shall arise in the States,"
waltwhitman,"They shall report Nature, laws, physiology, and happiness,"
waltwhitman,"They shall illustrate Democracy and the kosmos,"
waltwhitman,"They shall be alimentive, amative, perceptive,"
waltwhitman,"They shall be complete women and men, their pose brawny and supple,"
waltwhitman,"their drink water, their blood clean and clear,"
waltwhitman,"They shall fully enjoy materialism and the sight of products, they"
waltwhitman,"shall enjoy the sight of the beef, lumber, bread-stuffs, of"
waltwhitman,Chicago the great city.
waltwhitman,They shall train themselves to go in public to become orators and
waltwhitman,"oratresses,"
waltwhitman,"Strong and sweet shall their tongues be, poems and materials of"
waltwhitman,"poems shall come from their lives, they shall be makers and finders,"
waltwhitman,"Of them and of their works shall emerge divine conveyers, to convey gospels,"
waltwhitman,"Characters, events, retrospections, shall be convey'd in gospels,"
waltwhitman,"trees, animals, waters, shall be convey'd,"
waltwhitman,"Death, the future, the invisible faith, shall all be convey'd."
waltwhitman,"Weave in, My Hardy Life"
waltwhitman,"Weave in, weave in, my hardy life,"
waltwhitman,"Weave yet a soldier strong and full for great campaigns to come,"
waltwhitman,"Weave in red blood, weave sinews in like ropes, the senses, sight weave in,"
waltwhitman,"Weave lasting sure, weave day and night the wet, the warp, incessant"
waltwhitman,"weave, tire not,"
waltwhitman,"(We know not what the use O life, nor know the aim, the end, nor"
waltwhitman,"really aught we know,"
waltwhitman,"But know the work, the need goes on and shall go on, the"
waltwhitman,"death-envelop'd march of peace as well as war goes on,)"
waltwhitman,"For great campaigns of peace the same the wiry threads to weave,"
waltwhitman,"We know not why or what, yet weave, forever weave."
waltwhitman,"Spain, 1873-74"
waltwhitman,"Out of the murk of heaviest clouds,"
waltwhitman,"Out of the feudal wrecks and heap'd-up skeletons of kings,"
waltwhitman,"Out of that old entire European debris, the shatter'd mummeries,"
waltwhitman,"Ruin'd cathedrals, crumble of palaces, tombs of priests,"
waltwhitman,"Lo, Freedom's features fresh undimm'd look forth--the same immortal"
waltwhitman,face looks forth;
waltwhitman,"(A glimpse as of thy Mother's face Columbia,"
waltwhitman,"A flash significant as of a sword,"
waltwhitman,Beaming towards thee.)
waltwhitman,Nor think we forget thee maternal;
waltwhitman,Lag'd'st thou so long? shall the clouds close again upon thee?
waltwhitman,"Ah, but thou hast thyself now appear'd to us--we know thee,"
waltwhitman,"Thou hast given us a sure proof, the glimpse of thyself,"
waltwhitman,Thou waitest there as everywhere thy time.
waltwhitman,By Broad Potomac's Shore
waltwhitman,"By broad Potomac's shore, again old tongue,"
waltwhitman,"(Still uttering, still ejaculating, canst never cease this babble?)"
waltwhitman,"Again old heart so gay, again to you, your sense, the full flush"
waltwhitman,"spring returning,"
waltwhitman,"Again the freshness and the odors, again Virginia's summer sky,"
waltwhitman,"pellucid blue and silver,"
waltwhitman,"Again the forenoon purple of the hills,"
waltwhitman,"Again the deathless grass, so noiseless soft and green,"
waltwhitman,Again the blood-red roses blooming.
waltwhitman,Perfume this book of mine O blood-red roses!
waltwhitman,Lave subtly with your waters every line Potomac!
waltwhitman,"Give me of you O spring, before I close, to put between its pages!"
waltwhitman,"O forenoon purple of the hills, before I close, of you!"
waltwhitman,"O deathless grass, of you!"
waltwhitman,"From Far Dakota's Canyons  [June 25, 1876]"
waltwhitman,"From far Dakota's canyons,"
waltwhitman,"Lands of the wild ravine, the dusky Sioux, the lonesome stretch, the"
waltwhitman,"silence,"
waltwhitman,"Haply to-day a mournful wall, haply a trumpet-note for heroes."
waltwhitman,"The battle-bulletin,"
waltwhitman,"The Indian ambuscade, the craft, the fatal environment,"
waltwhitman,"The cavalry companies fighting to the last in sternest heroism,"
waltwhitman,"In the midst of their little circle, with their slaughter'd horses"
waltwhitman,"for breastworks,"
waltwhitman,The fall of Custer and all his officers and men.
waltwhitman,"Continues yet the old, old legend of our race,"
waltwhitman,"The loftiest of life upheld by death,"
waltwhitman,"The ancient banner perfectly maintain'd,"
waltwhitman,"O lesson opportune, O how I welcome thee!"
waltwhitman,"As sitting in dark days,"
waltwhitman,"Lone, sulky, through the time's thick murk looking in vain for"
waltwhitman,"light, for hope,"
waltwhitman,"From unsuspected parts a fierce and momentary proof,"
waltwhitman,"(The sun there at the centre though conceal'd,"
waltwhitman,"Electric life forever at the centre,)"
waltwhitman,Breaks forth a lightning flash.
waltwhitman,"Thou of the tawny flowing hair in battle,"
waltwhitman,"I erewhile saw, with erect head, pressing ever in front, bearing a"
waltwhitman,"bright sword in thy hand,"
waltwhitman,"Now ending well in death the splendid fever of thy deeds,"
waltwhitman,"(I bring no dirge for it or thee, I bring a glad triumphal sonnet,)"
waltwhitman,"Desperate and glorious, aye in defeat most desperate, most glorious,"
waltwhitman,"After thy many battles in which never yielding up a gun or a color,"
waltwhitman,"Leaving behind thee a memory sweet to soldiers,"
waltwhitman,Thou yieldest up thyself.
waltwhitman,Old War-Dreams
waltwhitman,"In midnight sleep of many a face of anguish,"
waltwhitman,"Of the look at first of the mortally wounded, (of that indescribable look,)"
waltwhitman,"Of the dead on their backs with arms extended wide,"
waltwhitman,"I dream, I dream, I dream."
waltwhitman,"Of scenes of Nature, fields and mountains,"
waltwhitman,"Of skies so beauteous after a storm, and at night the moon so"
waltwhitman,"unearthly bright,"
waltwhitman,"Shining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches and"
waltwhitman,"gather the heaps,"
waltwhitman,"I dream, I dream, I dream."
waltwhitman,"Long have they pass'd, faces and trenches and fields,"
waltwhitman,"Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure, or away"
waltwhitman,"from the fallen,"
waltwhitman,"Onward I sped at the time--but now of their forms at night,"
waltwhitman,"I dream, I dream, I dream."
waltwhitman,Thick-Sprinkled Bunting
waltwhitman,Thick-sprinkled bunting! flag of stars!
waltwhitman,"Long yet your road, fateful flag--long yet your road, and lined with"
waltwhitman,"bloody death,"
waltwhitman,"For the prize I see at issue at last is the world,"
waltwhitman,All its ships and shores I see interwoven with your threads greedy banner;
waltwhitman,"Dream'd again the flags of kings, highest borne to flaunt unrival'd?"
waltwhitman,"O hasten flag of man--O with sure and steady step, passing highest"
waltwhitman,"flags of kings,"
waltwhitman,"Walk supreme to the heavens mighty symbol--run up above them all,"
waltwhitman,Flag of stars! thick-sprinkled bunting!
waltwhitman,What Best I See in Thee
waltwhitman,[To U. S. G. return'd from his World's Tour]
waltwhitman,"What best I see in thee,"
waltwhitman,"Is not that where thou mov'st down history's great highways,"
waltwhitman,"Ever undimm'd by time shoots warlike victory's dazzle,"
waltwhitman,"Or that thou sat'st where Washington sat, ruling the land in peace,"
waltwhitman,"Or thou the man whom feudal Europe feted, venerable Asia swarm'd upon,"
waltwhitman,Who walk'd with kings with even pace the round world's promenade;
waltwhitman,"But that in foreign lands, in all thy walks with kings,"
waltwhitman,"Those prairie sovereigns of the West, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,"
waltwhitman,"Ohio's, Indiana's millions, comrades, farmers, soldiers, all to the front,"
waltwhitman,Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round
waltwhitman,"world's promenade,"
waltwhitman,Were all so justified.
waltwhitman,Spirit That Form'd This Scene
waltwhitman,"[Written in Platte Canyon, Colorado]"
waltwhitman,"Spirit that form'd this scene,"
waltwhitman,"These tumbled rock-piles grim and red,"
waltwhitman,"These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,"
waltwhitman,"These gorges, turbulent-clear streams, this naked freshness,"
waltwhitman,"These formless wild arrays, for reasons of their own,"
waltwhitman,"I know thee, savage spirit--we have communed together,"
waltwhitman,"Mine too such wild arrays, for reasons of their own;"
waltwhitman,Wast charged against my chants they had forgotten art?
waltwhitman,To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delicatesse?
waltwhitman,"The lyrist's measur'd beat, the wrought-out temple's grace--column"
waltwhitman,and polish'd arch forgot?
waltwhitman,"But thou that revelest here--spirit that form'd this scene,"
waltwhitman,They have remember'd thee.
waltwhitman,As I Walk These Broad Majestic Days
waltwhitman,"As I walk these broad majestic days of peace,"
waltwhitman,"(For the war, the struggle of blood finish'd, wherein, O terrific Ideal,"
waltwhitman,"Against vast odds erewhile having gloriously won,"
waltwhitman,"Now thou stridest on, yet perhaps in time toward denser wars,"
waltwhitman,"Perhaps to engage in time in still more dreadful contests, dangers,"
waltwhitman,"Longer campaigns and crises, labors beyond all others,)"
waltwhitman,"Around me I hear that eclat of the world, politics, produce,"
waltwhitman,"The announcements of recognized things, science,"
waltwhitman,The approved growth of cities and the spread of inventions.
waltwhitman,"I see the ships, (they will last a few years,)"
waltwhitman,"The vast factories with their foremen and workmen,"
waltwhitman,"And hear the indorsement of all, and do not object to it."
waltwhitman,"But I too announce solid things,"
waltwhitman,"Science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not nothing,"
waltwhitman,"Like a grand procession to music of distant bugles pouring,"
waltwhitman,"triumphantly moving, and grander heaving in sight,"
waltwhitman,They stand for realities--all is as it should be.
waltwhitman,Then my realities;
waltwhitman,What else is so real as mine?
waltwhitman,"Libertad and the divine average, freedom to every slave on the face"
waltwhitman,"of the earth,"
waltwhitman,"The rapt promises and lumine of seers, the spiritual world, these"
waltwhitman,"centuries-lasting songs,"
waltwhitman,"And our visions, the visions of poets, the most solid announcements"
waltwhitman,of any.
waltwhitman,A Clear Midnight
waltwhitman,"This is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,"
waltwhitman,"Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,"
waltwhitman,"Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou"
waltwhitman,"lovest best,"
waltwhitman,"Night, sleep, death and the stars."
waltwhitman,BOOK XXXIII.  SONGS OF PARTING
waltwhitman,As the Time Draws Nigh
waltwhitman,"As the time draws nigh glooming a cloud,"
waltwhitman,A dread beyond of I know not what darkens me.
waltwhitman,"I shall go forth,"
waltwhitman,"I shall traverse the States awhile, but I cannot tell whither or how long,"
waltwhitman,Perhaps soon some day or night while I am singing my voice will
waltwhitman,suddenly cease.
waltwhitman,"O book, O chants! must all then amount to but this?"
waltwhitman,Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us? --and yet it is
waltwhitman,"enough, O soul;"
waltwhitman,"O soul, we have positively appear'd--that is enough."
waltwhitman,Years of the Modern
waltwhitman,Years of the modern! years of the unperform'd!
waltwhitman,"Your horizon rises, I see it parting away for more august dramas,"
waltwhitman,"I see not America only, not only Liberty's nation but other nations"
waltwhitman,"preparing,"
waltwhitman,"I see tremendous entrances and exits, new combinations, the solidarity"
waltwhitman,"of races,"
waltwhitman,"I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world's stage,"
waltwhitman,"(Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the acts"
waltwhitman,suitable to them closed?)
waltwhitman,"I see Freedom, completely arm'd and victorious and very haughty,"
waltwhitman,"with Law on one side and Peace on the other,"
waltwhitman,A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste;
waltwhitman,What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?
waltwhitman,"I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions,"
waltwhitman,"I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken,"
waltwhitman,"I see the landmarks of European kings removed,"
waltwhitman,"I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, (all others give way;)"
waltwhitman,"Never were such sharp questions ask'd as this day,"
waltwhitman,"Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a God,"
waltwhitman,"Lo, how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest!"
waltwhitman,"His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere, he colonizes the"
waltwhitman,"Pacific, the archipelagoes,"
waltwhitman,"With the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the"
waltwhitman,"wholesale engines of war,"
waltwhitman,With these and the world-spreading factories he interlinks all
waltwhitman,"geography, all lands;"
waltwhitman,"What whispers are these O lands, running ahead of you, passing under"
waltwhitman,the seas?
waltwhitman,Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the globe?
waltwhitman,"Is humanity forming en-masse? for lo, tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim,"
waltwhitman,"The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war,"
waltwhitman,"No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the days and nights;"
waltwhitman,"Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to"
waltwhitman,"pierce it, is full of phantoms,"
waltwhitman,"Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me,"
waltwhitman,"This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of dreams"
waltwhitman,O years!
waltwhitman,"Your dreams O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not"
waltwhitman,whether I sleep or wake;)
waltwhitman,"The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me,"
waltwhitman,"The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me."
waltwhitman,Ashes of Soldiers
waltwhitman,"Ashes of soldiers South or North,"
waltwhitman,"As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought,"
waltwhitman,"The war resumes, again to my sense your shapes,"
waltwhitman,And again the advance of the armies.
waltwhitman,"Noiseless as mists and vapors,"
waltwhitman,"From their graves in the trenches ascending,"
waltwhitman,"From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee,"
waltwhitman,"From every point of the compass out of the countless graves,"
waltwhitman,"In wafted clouds, in myriads large, or squads of twos or threes or"
waltwhitman,"single ones they come,"
waltwhitman,And silently gather round me.
waltwhitman,"Now sound no note O trumpeters,"
waltwhitman,"Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses,"
waltwhitman,"With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by their thighs, (ah"
waltwhitman,my brave horsemen!
waltwhitman,"My handsome tan-faced horsemen! what life, what joy and pride,"
waltwhitman,With all the perils were yours.)
waltwhitman,"Nor you drummers, neither at reveille at dawn,"
waltwhitman,"Nor the long roll alarming the camp, nor even the muffled beat for burial,"
waltwhitman,Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlike drums.
waltwhitman,"But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade,"
waltwhitman,"Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless,"
waltwhitman,"The slain elate and alive again, the dust and debris alive,"
waltwhitman,I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers.
waltwhitman,"Faces so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet,"
waltwhitman,"Draw close, but speak not."
waltwhitman,"Phantoms of countless lost,"
waltwhitman,"Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions,"
waltwhitman,Follow me ever--desert me not while I live.
waltwhitman,Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living--sweet are the musical
waltwhitman,"voices sounding,"
waltwhitman,"But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead with their silent eyes."
waltwhitman,"Dearest comrades, all is over and long gone,"
waltwhitman,"But love is not over--and what love, O comrades!"
waltwhitman,"Perfume from battle-fields rising, up from the foetor arising."
waltwhitman,"Perfume therefore my chant, O love, immortal love,"
waltwhitman,"Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers,"
waltwhitman,"Shroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender pride."
waltwhitman,"Perfume all--make all wholesome,"
waltwhitman,"Make these ashes to nourish and blossom,"
waltwhitman,"O love, solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry."
waltwhitman,"Give me exhaustless, make me a fountain,"
waltwhitman,"That I exhale love from me wherever I go like a moist perennial dew,"
waltwhitman,For the ashes of all dead soldiers South or North.
waltwhitman,Thoughts
waltwhitman,1
waltwhitman,"Of these years I sing,"
waltwhitman,"How they pass and have pass'd through convuls'd pains, as through"
waltwhitman,"parturitions,"
waltwhitman,"How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the promise, the sure"
waltwhitman,"fulfilment, the absolute success, despite of people--illustrates"
waltwhitman,"evil as well as good,"
waltwhitman,"The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one's-self,"
waltwhitman,"How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, myths,"
waltwhitman,"obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity,"
waltwhitman,"How few see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western States, or"
waltwhitman,"see freedom or spirituality, or hold any faith in results,"
waltwhitman,"(But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious"
waltwhitman,"and inevitable, and they again leading to other results.)"
waltwhitman,"How the great cities appear--how the Democratic masses, turbulent,"
waltwhitman,"willful, as I love them,"
waltwhitman,"How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the"
waltwhitman,"sounding and resounding, keep on and on,"
waltwhitman,"How society waits unform'd, and is for a while between things ended"
waltwhitman,"and things begun,"
waltwhitman,"How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of"
waltwhitman,"freedom and of the Democracies, and of the fruits of society, and"
waltwhitman,"of all that is begun,"
waltwhitman,And how the States are complete in themselves--and how all triumphs
waltwhitman,"and glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,"
waltwhitman,And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be
waltwhitman,"convuls'd, and serve other parturitions and transitions,"
waltwhitman,"And how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic masses too,"
waltwhitman,"serve--and how every fact, and war itself, with all its horrors,"
waltwhitman,"serves,"
waltwhitman,And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death.
waltwhitman,2
waltwhitman,"Of seeds dropping into the ground, of births,"
waltwhitman,"Of the steady concentration of America, inland, upward, to"
waltwhitman,"impregnable and swarming places,"
waltwhitman,"Of what Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, and the rest, are to be,"
waltwhitman,"Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada,"
waltwhitman,"and the rest,"
waltwhitman,"(Or afar, mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska,)"
waltwhitman,Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for--and of what
waltwhitman,"all sights, North, South, East and West, are,"
waltwhitman,"Of this Union welded in blood, of the solemn price paid, of the"
waltwhitman,unnamed lost ever present in my mind;
waltwhitman,"Of the temporary use of materials for identity's sake,"
waltwhitman,"Of the present, passing, departing--of the growth of completer men"
waltwhitman,"than any yet,"
waltwhitman,"Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother, the"
waltwhitman,"Mississippi flows,"
waltwhitman,"Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey'd and unsuspected,"
waltwhitman,"Of the new and good names, of the modern developments, of"
waltwhitman,"inalienable homesteads,"
waltwhitman,"Of a free and original life there, of simple diet and clean and"
waltwhitman,"sweet blood,"
waltwhitman,"Of litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes, and perfect physique there,"
waltwhitman,"Of immense spiritual results future years far West, each side of the"
waltwhitman,"Anahuacs,"
waltwhitman,"Of these songs, well understood there, (being made for that area,)"
waltwhitman,"Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there,"
waltwhitman,(O it lurks in me night and day--what is gain after all to savageness
waltwhitman,and freedom?)
waltwhitman,Song at Sunset
waltwhitman,"Splendor of ended day floating and filling me,"
waltwhitman,"Hour prophetic, hour resuming the past,"
waltwhitman,"Inflating my throat, you divine average,"
waltwhitman,You earth and life till the last ray gleams I sing.
waltwhitman,"Open mouth of my soul uttering gladness,"
waltwhitman,"Eyes of my soul seeing perfection,"
waltwhitman,"Natural life of me faithfully praising things,"
waltwhitman,Corroborating forever the triumph of things.
waltwhitman,Illustrious every one!
waltwhitman,"Illustrious what we name space, sphere of unnumber'd spirits,"
waltwhitman,"Illustrious the mystery of motion in all beings, even the tiniest insect,"
waltwhitman,"Illustrious the attribute of speech, the senses, the body,"
waltwhitman,Illustrious the passing light--illustrious the pale reflection on
waltwhitman,"the new moon in the western sky,"
waltwhitman,"Illustrious whatever I see or hear or touch, to the last."
waltwhitman,"Good in all,"
waltwhitman,"In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals,"
waltwhitman,"In the annual return of the seasons,"
waltwhitman,"In the hilarity of youth,"
waltwhitman,"In the strength and flush of manhood,"
waltwhitman,"In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,"
waltwhitman,In the superb vistas of death.
waltwhitman,Wonderful to depart!
waltwhitman,Wonderful to be here!
waltwhitman,"The heart, to jet the all-alike and innocent blood!"
waltwhitman,"To breathe the air, how delicious!"
waltwhitman,To speak--to walk--to seize something by the hand!
waltwhitman,"To prepare for sleep, for bed, to look on my rose-color'd flesh!"
waltwhitman,"To be conscious of my body, so satisfied, so large!"
waltwhitman,To be this incredible God I am!
waltwhitman,"To have gone forth among other Gods, these men and women I love."
waltwhitman,Wonderful how I celebrate you and myself
waltwhitman,How my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around!
waltwhitman,How the clouds pass silently overhead!
waltwhitman,"How the earth darts on and on! and how the sun, moon, stars, dart on and on!"
waltwhitman,How the water sports and sings! (surely it is alive!)
waltwhitman,"How the trees rise and stand up, with strong trunks, with branches"
waltwhitman,and leaves!
waltwhitman,"(Surely there is something more in each of the trees, some living soul.)"
waltwhitman,O amazement of things--even the least particle!
waltwhitman,O spirituality of things!
waltwhitman,"O strain musical flowing through ages and continents, now reaching"
waltwhitman,me and America!
waltwhitman,"I take your strong chords, intersperse them, and cheerfully pass"
waltwhitman,them forward.
waltwhitman,"I too carol the sun, usher'd or at noon, or as now, setting,"
waltwhitman,I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all the
waltwhitman,"growths of the earth,"
waltwhitman,I too have felt the resistless call of myself.
waltwhitman,"As I steam'd down the Mississippi,"
waltwhitman,"As I wander'd over the prairies,"
waltwhitman,"As I have lived, as I have look'd through my windows my eyes,"
waltwhitman,"As I went forth in the morning, as I beheld the light breaking in the east,"
waltwhitman,"As I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea, and again on the beach"
waltwhitman,"of the Western Sea,"
waltwhitman,"As I roam'd the streets of inland Chicago, whatever streets I have roam'd,"
waltwhitman,"Or cities or silent woods, or even amid the sights of war,"
waltwhitman,Wherever I have been I have charged myself with contentment and triumph.
waltwhitman,"I sing to the last the equalities modern or old,"
waltwhitman,"I sing the endless finales of things,"
waltwhitman,"I say Nature continues, glory continues,"
waltwhitman,"I praise with electric voice,"
waltwhitman,"For I do not see one imperfection in the universe,"
waltwhitman,And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe.
waltwhitman,"O setting sun! though the time has come,"
waltwhitman,"I still warble under you, if none else does, unmitigated adoration."
waltwhitman,As at Thy Portals Also Death
waltwhitman,"As at thy portals also death,"
waltwhitman,"Entering thy sovereign, dim, illimitable grounds,"
waltwhitman,"To memories of my mother, to the divine blending, maternity,"
waltwhitman,"To her, buried and gone, yet buried not, gone not from me,"
waltwhitman,"(I see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still,"
waltwhitman,"I sit by the form in the coffin,"
waltwhitman,"I kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips, the cheeks,"
waltwhitman,the closed eyes in the coffin;)
waltwhitman,"To her, the ideal woman, practical, spiritual, of all of earth,"
waltwhitman,"life, love, to me the best,"
waltwhitman,"I grave a monumental line, before I go, amid these songs,"
waltwhitman,And set a tombstone here.
waltwhitman,My Legacy
waltwhitman,"The business man the acquirer vast,"
waltwhitman,"After assiduous years surveying results, preparing for departure,"
waltwhitman,"Devises houses and lands to his children, bequeaths stocks, goods,"
waltwhitman,"funds for a school or hospital,"
waltwhitman,"Leaves money to certain companions to buy tokens, souvenirs of gems"
waltwhitman,and gold.
waltwhitman,"But I, my life surveying, closing,"
waltwhitman,"With nothing to show to devise from its idle years,"
waltwhitman,"Nor houses nor lands, nor tokens of gems or gold for my friends,"
waltwhitman,"Yet certain remembrances of the war for you, and after you,"
waltwhitman,"And little souvenirs of camps and soldiers, with my love,"
waltwhitman,I bind together and bequeath in this bundle of songs.
waltwhitman,Pensive on Her Dead Gazing
waltwhitman,"Pensive on her dead gazing I heard the Mother of All,"
waltwhitman,"Desperate on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battlefields gazing,"
waltwhitman,"(As the last gun ceased, but the scent of the powder-smoke linger'd,)"

waltwhitman,"The last of afternoons, the evening hours, for many a year his"
waltwhitman,"regular custom,"
waltwhitman,"In his great arm chair by the window seated,"
waltwhitman,"(Sometimes, indeed, through half the day,)"
waltwhitman,"Watching the coming, going of the vessels, he mutters to himself--"
waltwhitman,And now the close of all:
waltwhitman,"One struggling outbound brig, one day, baffled for long--cross-tides"
waltwhitman,"and much wrong going,"
waltwhitman,"At last at nightfall strikes the breeze aright, her whole luck veering,"
waltwhitman,"And swiftly bending round the cape, the darkness proudly entering,"
waltwhitman,"cleaving, as he watches,"
waltwhitman,"""She's free--she's on her destination""--these the last words--when"
waltwhitman,"Jenny came, he sat there dead,"
waltwhitman,"Dutch Kossabone, Old Salt, related on my mother's side, far back."

waltwhitman,The perfect singing voice--deepest of all to me the lesson--trial
waltwhitman,and test of all:)
waltwhitman,"How through those strains distill'd--how the rapt ears, the soul of"
waltwhitman,"me, absorbing"

waltwhitman,"I fold thenceforth, or seek to fold, within my chants transmuting,"
waltwhitman,"Freedom's and Love's and Faith's unloos'd cantabile,"
waltwhitman,"(As perfume's, color's, sunlight's correlation:)"

waltwhitman,Continuities
waltwhitman,"Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost,"

waltwhitman,"A song, a poem of itself--the word itself a dirge,"
waltwhitman,"Amid the wilds, the rocks, the storm and wintry night,"
waltwhitman,"To me such misty, strange tableaux the syllables calling up;"
waltwhitman,"Yonnondio--I see, far in the west or north, a limitless ravine, with"
waltwhitman,"plains and mountains dark,"
waltwhitman,"I see swarms of stalwart chieftains, medicine-men, and warriors,"

waltwhitman,"Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy alone,"
waltwhitman,"nor brain alone, is worthy for the Muse;--I say the Form complete"
waltwhitman,"is worthier far. The Female equally with the Male, I sing."
waltwhitman,Nor cease at the theme of One's-Self. I speak the word of the
waltwhitman,"modern, the word En-Masse."
waltwhitman,"My Days I sing, and the Lands--with interstice I knew of hapless War."
waltwhitman,"(O friend, whoe'er you are, at last arriving hither to commence, I"

waltwhitman,"at the west a voice triumphant--justifying all,"
waltwhitman,A gladsome pealing cry--a song for once of utmost pride and satisfaction;
waltwhitman,"I chant from it the common bulk, the general average horde, (the"
waltwhitman,"best sooner than the worst)--And now I chant old age,"
waltwhitman,"(My verses, written first for forenoon life, and for the summer's,"
waltwhitman,"autumn's spread,"
waltwhitman,"I pass to snow-white hairs the same, and give to pulses"
waltwhitman,winter-cool'd the same;)
waltwhitman,"As here in careless trill, I and my recitatives, with faith and love,"
waltwhitman,"wafting to other work, to unknown songs, conditions,"
waltwhitman,"On, on ye jocund twain! continue on the same!"
waltwhitman,MY 71st Year
waltwhitman,"After surmounting three-score and ten,"
waltwhitman,"With all their chances, changes, losses, sorrows,"
waltwhitman,"My parents' deaths, the vagaries of my life, the many tearing"
waltwhitman,"passions of me, the war of '63 and '4,"
waltwhitman,"As some old broken soldier, after a long, hot, wearying march, or"
waltwhitman,"haply after battle,"
waltwhitman,"To-day at twilight, hobbling, answering company roll-call, Here,"
waltwhitman,"with vital voice,"
waltwhitman,"Reporting yet, saluting yet the Officer over all."
waltwhitman,Apparitions
waltwhitman,A vague mist hanging 'round half the pages:
waltwhitman,"(Sometimes how strange and clear to the soul,"
waltwhitman,"That all these solid things are indeed but apparitions, concepts,"
waltwhitman,non-realities.)
waltwhitman,The Pallid Wreath
waltwhitman,"Somehow I cannot let it go yet, funeral though it is,"
waltwhitman,"Let it remain back there on its nail suspended,"
waltwhitman,"With pink, blue, yellow, all blanch'd, and the white now gray and ashy,"
waltwhitman,"One wither'd rose put years ago for thee, dear friend;"
waltwhitman,But I do not forget thee. Hast thou then faded?
waltwhitman,"Is the odor exhaled? Are the colors, vitalities, dead?"
waltwhitman,"No, while memories subtly play--the past vivid as ever;"
waltwhitman,"For but last night I woke, and in that spectral ring saw thee,"
waltwhitman,"Thy smile, eyes, face, calm, silent, loving as ever:"
waltwhitman,"So let the wreath hang still awhile within my eye-reach,"
waltwhitman,"It is not yet dead to me, nor even pallid."
waltwhitman,An Ended Day
waltwhitman,"The soothing sanity and blitheness of completion,"
waltwhitman,The pomp and hurried contest-glare and rush are done;
waltwhitman,Now triumph! transformation! jubilate!
waltwhitman,Old Age's Ship & Crafty Death's
waltwhitman,"From east and west across the horizon's edge,"
waltwhitman,Two mighty masterful vessels sailers steal upon us:
waltwhitman,But we'll make race a-time upon the seas--a battle-contest yet! bear
waltwhitman,lively there!
waltwhitman,(Our joys of strife and derring-do to the last!)
waltwhitman,Put on the old ship all her power to-day!
waltwhitman,"Crowd top-sail, top-gallant and royal studding-sails,"
waltwhitman,"Out challenge and defiance--flags and flaunting pennants added,"
waltwhitman,"As we take to the open--take to the deepest, freest waters."
waltwhitman,To the Pending Year
waltwhitman,Have I no weapon-word for thee--some message brief and fierce?
waltwhitman,"(Have I fought out and done indeed the battle?) Is there no shot left,"
waltwhitman,"For all thy affectations, lisps, scorns, manifold silliness?"
waltwhitman,Nor for myself--my own rebellious self in thee?
waltwhitman,"Down, down, proud gorge!--though choking thee;"
waltwhitman,Thy bearded throat and high-borne forehead to the gutter;
waltwhitman,Crouch low thy neck to eleemosynary gifts.
waltwhitman,Shakspere-Bacon's Cipher
waltwhitman,"I doubt it not--then more, far more;"
waltwhitman,"In each old song bequeath'd--in every noble page or text,"
waltwhitman,"(Different--something unreck'd before--some unsuspected author,)"
waltwhitman,"In every object, mountain, tree, and star--in every birth and life,"
waltwhitman,"As part of each--evolv'd from each--meaning, behind the ostent,"
waltwhitman,A mystic cipher waits infolded.
waltwhitman,"Long, Long Hence"
waltwhitman,"After a long, long course, hundreds of years, denials,"
waltwhitman,"Accumulations, rous'd love and joy and thought,"
waltwhitman,"Hopes, wishes, aspirations, ponderings, victories, myriads of readers,"
waltwhitman,"Coating, compassing, covering--after ages' and ages' encrustations,"
waltwhitman,Then only may these songs reach fruition.
waltwhitman,"Bravo, Paris Exposition!"
waltwhitman,"Add to your show, before you close it, France,"
waltwhitman,"With all the rest, visible, concrete, temples, towers, goods,"
waltwhitman,"machines and ores,"
waltwhitman,"Our sentiment wafted from many million heart-throbs, ethereal but solid,"
waltwhitman,"(We grand-sons and great-grandsons do not forget your grandsires,)"
waltwhitman,"From fifty Nations and nebulous Nations, compacted, sent oversea to-day,"
waltwhitman,"America's applause, love, memories and good-will."
waltwhitman,Interpolation Sounds
waltwhitman,"Over and through the burial chant,"
waltwhitman,"Organ and solemn service, sermon, bending priests,"
waltwhitman,"To me come interpolation sounds not in the show--plainly to me,"
waltwhitman,"crowding up the aisle and from the window,"
waltwhitman,Of sudden battle's hurry and harsh noises--war's grim game to sight
waltwhitman,and ear in earnest;
waltwhitman,The scout call'd up and forward--the general mounted and his aides
waltwhitman,around him--the new-brought word--the instantaneous order issued;
waltwhitman,The rifle crack--the cannon thud--the rushing forth of men from their
waltwhitman,tents;
waltwhitman,The clank of cavalry--the strange celerity of forming ranks--the
waltwhitman,slender bugle note;
waltwhitman,"The sound of horses' hoofs departing--saddles, arms, accoutrements."
waltwhitman,To the Sun-Set Breeze
waltwhitman,"Ah, whispering, something again, unseen,"
waltwhitman,"Where late this heated day thou enterest at my window, door,"
waltwhitman,"Thou, laving, tempering all, cool-freshing, gently vitalizing"
waltwhitman,"Me, old, alone, sick, weak-down, melted-worn with sweat;"
waltwhitman,"Thou, nestling, folding close and firm yet soft, companion better"
waltwhitman,"than talk, book, art,"
waltwhitman,"(Thou hast, O Nature! elements! utterance to my heart beyond the"
waltwhitman,"rest--and this is of them,)"
waltwhitman,So sweet thy primitive taste to breathe within--thy soothing fingers
waltwhitman,"my face and hands,"
waltwhitman,"Thou, messenger--magical strange bringer to body and spirit of me,"
waltwhitman,"(Distances balk'd--occult medicines penetrating me from head to foot,)"
waltwhitman,"I feel the sky, the prairies vast--I feel the mighty northern lakes,"
waltwhitman,I feel the ocean and the forest--somehow I feel the globe itself
waltwhitman,swift-swimming in space;
waltwhitman,"Thou blown from lips so loved, now gone--haply from endless store,"
waltwhitman,"God-sent,"
waltwhitman,"(For thou art spiritual, Godly, most of all known to my sense,)"
waltwhitman,"Minister to speak to me, here and now, what word has never told, and"
waltwhitman,"cannot tell,"
waltwhitman,"Art thou not universal concrete's distillation? Law's, all"
waltwhitman,Astronomy's last refinement?
waltwhitman,"Hast thou no soul? Can I not know, identify thee?"
waltwhitman,Old Chants
waltwhitman,"An ancient song, reciting, ending,"
waltwhitman,"Once gazing toward thee, Mother of All,"
waltwhitman,"Musing, seeking themes fitted for thee,"
waltwhitman,"Accept me, thou saidst, the elder ballads,"
waltwhitman,And name for me before thou goest each ancient poet.
waltwhitman,"(Of many debts incalculable,"
waltwhitman,Haply our New World's chieftest debt is to old poems.)
waltwhitman,"Ever so far back, preluding thee, America,"
waltwhitman,"Old chants, Egyptian priests, and those of Ethiopia,"
waltwhitman,"The Hindu epics, the Grecian, Chinese, Persian,"
waltwhitman,"The Biblic books and prophets, and deep idyls of the Nazarene,"
waltwhitman,"The Iliad, Odyssey, plots, doings, wanderings of Eneas,"
waltwhitman,"Hesiod, Eschylus, Sophocles, Merlin, Arthur,"
waltwhitman,"The Cid, Roland at Roncesvalles, the Nibelungen,"
waltwhitman,"The troubadours, minstrels, minnesingers, skalds,"
waltwhitman,"Chaucer, Dante, flocks of singing birds,"
waltwhitman,"The Border Minstrelsy, the bye-gone ballads, feudal tales, essays, plays,"
waltwhitman,"Shakespere, Schiller, Walter Scott, Tennyson,"
waltwhitman,"As some vast wondrous weird dream-presences,"
waltwhitman,"The great shadowy groups gathering around,"
waltwhitman,"Darting their mighty masterful eyes forward at thee,"
waltwhitman,"Thou! with as now thy bending neck and head, with courteous hand"
waltwhitman,"and word, ascending,"
waltwhitman,"Thou! pausing a moment, drooping thine eyes upon them, blent"
waltwhitman,"with their music,"
waltwhitman,"Well pleased, accepting all, curiously prepared for by them,"
waltwhitman,Thou enterest at thy entrance porch.
waltwhitman,A Christmas Greeting
waltwhitman,"Welcome, Brazilian brother--thy ample place is ready;"
waltwhitman,A loving hand--a smile from the north--a sunny instant hall!
waltwhitman,"(Let the future care for itself, where it reveals its troubles,"
waltwhitman,"impedimentas,"
waltwhitman,"Ours, ours the present throe, the democratic aim, the acceptance and"
waltwhitman,the faith;)
waltwhitman,"To thee to-day our reaching arm, our turning neck--to thee from us"
waltwhitman,"the expectant eye,"
waltwhitman,"Thou cluster free! thou brilliant lustrous one! thou, learning well,"
waltwhitman,"The true lesson of a nation's light in the sky,"
waltwhitman,"(More shining than the Cross, more than the Crown,)"
waltwhitman,The height to be superb humanity.
waltwhitman,Sounds of the Winter
waltwhitman,"Sounds of the winter too,"
waltwhitman,Sunshine upon the mountains--many a distant strain
waltwhitman,"From cheery railroad train--from nearer field, barn, house,"
waltwhitman,"The whispering air--even the mute crops, garner'd apples, corn,"
waltwhitman,"Children's and women's tones--rhythm of many a farmer and of flail,"
waltwhitman,"An old man's garrulous lips among the rest, Think not we give out yet,"
waltwhitman,Forth from these snowy hairs we keep up yet the lilt.
waltwhitman,A Twilight Song
waltwhitman,"As I sit in twilight late alone by the flickering oak-flame,"
waltwhitman,Musing on long-pass'd war-scenes--of the countless buried unknown
waltwhitman,"soldiers,"
waltwhitman,"Of the vacant names, as unindented air's and sea's--the unreturn'd,"
waltwhitman,"The brief truce after battle, with grim burial-squads, and the"
waltwhitman,deep-fill'd trenches
waltwhitman,"Of gather'd from dead all America, North, South, East, West, whence"
waltwhitman,"they came up,"
waltwhitman,"From wooded Maine, New-England's farms, from fertile Pennsylvania,"
waltwhitman,"Illinois, Ohio,"
waltwhitman,"From the measureless West, Virginia, the South, the Carolinas, Texas,"
waltwhitman,(Even here in my room-shadows and half-lights in the noiseless
waltwhitman,"flickering flames,"
waltwhitman,"Again I see the stalwart ranks on-filing, rising--I hear the"
waltwhitman,rhythmic tramp of the armies;)
waltwhitman,"You million unwrit names all, all--you dark bequest from all the war,"
waltwhitman,A special verse for you--a flash of duty long neglected--your mystic
waltwhitman,"roll strangely gather'd here,"
waltwhitman,"Each name recall'd by me from out the darkness and death's ashes,"
waltwhitman,"Henceforth to be, deep, deep within my heart recording, for many"
waltwhitman,"future year,"
waltwhitman,"Your mystic roll entire of unknown names, or North or South,"
waltwhitman,Embalm'd with love in this twilight song.
waltwhitman,When the Full-Grown Poet Came
waltwhitman,"When the full-grown poet came,"
waltwhitman,"Out spake pleased Nature (the round impassive globe, with all its"
waltwhitman,"shows of day and night,) saying, He is mine;"
waltwhitman,"But out spake too the Soul of man, proud, jealous and unreconciled,"
waltwhitman,Nay he is mine alone;
waltwhitman,"--Then the full-grown poet stood between the two, and took each"
waltwhitman,by the hand;
waltwhitman,"And to-day and ever so stands, as blender, uniter, tightly holding hands,"
waltwhitman,"Which he will never release until he reconciles the two,"
waltwhitman,And wholly and joyously blends them.
waltwhitman,Osceola
waltwhitman,"When his hour for death had come,"
waltwhitman,"He slowly rais'd himself from the bed on the floor,"
waltwhitman,"Drew on his war-dress, shirt, leggings, and girdled the belt around"
waltwhitman,"his waist,"
waltwhitman,"Call'd for vermilion paint (his looking-glass was held before him,)"
waltwhitman,"Painted half his face and neck, his wrists, and back-hands."
waltwhitman,"Put the scalp-knife carefully in his belt--then lying down, resting"
waltwhitman,"moment,"
waltwhitman,"Rose again, half sitting, smiled, gave in silence his extended hand"
waltwhitman,"to each and all,"
waltwhitman,"Sank faintly low to the floor (tightly grasping the tomahawk handle,)"
waltwhitman,Fix'd his look on wife and little children--the last:
waltwhitman,(And here a line in memory of his name and death.)
waltwhitman,A Voice from Death
waltwhitman,"A voice from Death, solemn and strange, in all his sweep and power,"
waltwhitman,"With sudden, indescribable blow--towns drown'd--humanity by"
waltwhitman,"thousands slain,"
waltwhitman,"The vaunted work of thrift, goods, dwellings, forge, street, iron bridge,"
waltwhitman,"Dash'd pell-mell by the blow--yet usher'd life continuing on,"
waltwhitman,"(Amid the rest, amid the rushing, whirling, wild debris,"
waltwhitman,A suffering woman saved--a baby safely born!)
waltwhitman,"Although I come and unannounc'd, in horror and in pang,"
waltwhitman,"In pouring flood and fire, and wholesale elemental crash, (this"
waltwhitman,"voice so solemn, strange,)"
waltwhitman,I too a minister of Deity.
waltwhitman,"Yea, Death, we bow our faces, veil our eyes to thee,"
waltwhitman,"We mourn the old, the young untimely drawn to thee,"
waltwhitman,"The fair, the strong, the good, the capable,"
waltwhitman,"The household wreck'd, the husband and the wife, the engulfed forger"
waltwhitman,"in his forge,"
waltwhitman,"The corpses in the whelming waters and the mud,"
waltwhitman,"The gather'd thousands to their funeral mounds, and thousands never"
waltwhitman,found or gather'd.
waltwhitman,"Then after burying, mourning the dead,"
waltwhitman,"(Faithful to them found or unfound, forgetting not, bearing the"
waltwhitman,"past, here new musing,)"
waltwhitman,"A day--a passing moment or an hour--America itself bends low,"
waltwhitman,"Silent, resign'd, submissive."
waltwhitman,"War, death, cataclysm like this, America,"
waltwhitman,Take deep to thy proud prosperous heart.
waltwhitman,"E'en as I chant, lo! out of death, and out of ooze and slime,"
waltwhitman,"The blossoms rapidly blooming, sympathy, help, love,"
waltwhitman,"From West and East, from South and North and over sea,"
waltwhitman,Its hot-spurr'd hearts and hands humanity to human aid moves on;
waltwhitman,And from within a thought and lesson yet.
waltwhitman,Thou ever-darting Globe! through Space and Air!
waltwhitman,Thou waters that encompass us!
waltwhitman,"Thou that in all the life and death of us, in action or in sleep!"
waltwhitman,"Thou laws invisible that permeate them and all,"
waltwhitman,"Thou that in all, and over all, and through and under all, incessant!"
waltwhitman,"Thou! thou! the vital, universal, giant force resistless, sleepless, calm,"
waltwhitman,"Holding Humanity as in thy open hand, as some ephemeral toy,"
waltwhitman,How ill to e'er forget thee!
waltwhitman,"For I too have forgotten,"
waltwhitman,"(Wrapt in these little potencies of progress, politics, culture,"
waltwhitman,"wealth, inventions, civilization,)"
waltwhitman,"Have lost my recognition of your silent ever-swaying power, ye"
waltwhitman,"mighty, elemental throes,"
waltwhitman,"In which and upon which we float, and every one of us is buoy'd."
waltwhitman,A Persian Lesson
waltwhitman,"For his o'erarching and last lesson the greybeard sufi,"
waltwhitman,"In the fresh scent of the morning in the open air,"
waltwhitman,"On the slope of a teeming Persian rose-garden,"
waltwhitman,"Under an ancient chestnut-tree wide spreading its branches,"
waltwhitman,Spoke to the young priests and students.
waltwhitman,"""Finally my children, to envelop each word, each part of the rest,"
waltwhitman,"Allah is all, all, all--immanent in every life and object,"
waltwhitman,"May-be at many and many-a-more removes--yet Allah, Allah, Allah is there."
waltwhitman,"""Has the estray wander'd far? Is the reason-why strangely hidden?"
waltwhitman,Would you sound below the restless ocean of the entire world?
waltwhitman,Would you know the dissatisfaction? the urge and spur of every life;
waltwhitman,The something never still'd--never entirely gone? the invisible need
waltwhitman,of every seed?
waltwhitman,"""It is the central urge in every atom,"
waltwhitman,"(Often unconscious, often evil, downfallen,)"
waltwhitman,"To return to its divine source and origin, however distant,"
waltwhitman,"Latent the same in subject and in object, without one exception."""
waltwhitman,The Commonplace
waltwhitman,The commonplace I sing;
waltwhitman,How cheap is health! how cheap nobility!
waltwhitman,"Abstinence, no falsehood, no gluttony, lust;"
waltwhitman,"The open air I sing, freedom, toleration,"
waltwhitman,"(Take here the mainest lesson--less from books--less from the schools,)"
waltwhitman,"The common day and night--the common earth and waters,"
waltwhitman,"Your farm--your work, trade, occupation,"
waltwhitman,"The democratic wisdom underneath, like solid ground for all."
waltwhitman,"""The Rounded Catalogue Divine Complete"""
waltwhitman,"The devilish and the dark, the dying and diseas'd,"
waltwhitman,"The countless (nineteen-twentieths) low and evil, crude and savage,"
waltwhitman,"The crazed, prisoners in jail, the horrible, rank, malignant,"
waltwhitman,"Venom and filth, serpents, the ravenous sharks, liars, the dissolute;"
waltwhitman,(What is the part the wicked and the loathesome bear within earth's
waltwhitman,orbic scheme?)
waltwhitman,"Newts, crawling things in slime and mud, poisons,"
waltwhitman,"The barren soil, the evil men, the slag and hideous rot."
waltwhitman,Mirages
waltwhitman,"More experiences and sights, stranger, than you'd think for;"
waltwhitman,"Times again, now mostly just after sunrise or before sunset,"
waltwhitman,"Sometimes in spring, oftener in autumn, perfectly clear weather, in"
waltwhitman,"plain sight,"
waltwhitman,"Camps far or near, the crowded streets of cities and the shopfronts,"
waltwhitman,"(Account for it or not--credit or not--it is all true,"
waltwhitman,And my mate there could tell you the like--we have often confab'd
waltwhitman,"about it,)"
waltwhitman,"People and scenes, animals, trees, colors and lines, plain as could be,"
waltwhitman,"Farms and dooryards of home, paths border'd with box, lilacs in corners,"
waltwhitman,"Weddings in churches, thanksgiving dinners, returns of long-absent sons,"
waltwhitman,"Glum funerals, the crape-veil'd mother and the daughters,"
waltwhitman,"Trials in courts, jury and judge, the accused in the box,"
waltwhitman,"Contestants, battles, crowds, bridges, wharves,"
waltwhitman,"Now and then mark'd faces of sorrow or joy,"
waltwhitman,"(I could pick them out this moment if I saw them again,)"
waltwhitman,"Show'd to me--just to the right in the sky-edge,"
waltwhitman,Or plainly there to the left on the hill-tops.
waltwhitman,L. of G.'s Purport
waltwhitman,"Not to exclude or demarcate, or pick out evils from their formidable"
waltwhitman,"masses (even to expose them,)"
waltwhitman,"But add, fuse, complete, extend--and celebrate the immortal and the good."
waltwhitman,"Haughty this song, its words and scope,"
waltwhitman,"To span vast realms of space and time,"
waltwhitman,Evolution--the cumulative--growths and generations.
waltwhitman,"Begun in ripen'd youth and steadily pursued,"
waltwhitman,"Wandering, peering, dallying with all--war, peace, day and night"
waltwhitman,"absorbing,"
waltwhitman,"Never even for one brief hour abandoning my task,"
waltwhitman,"I end it here in sickness, poverty, and old age."
waltwhitman,"I sing of life, yet mind me well of death:"
waltwhitman,"To-day shadowy Death dogs my steps, my seated shape, and has for years--"
waltwhitman,"Draws sometimes close to me, as face to face."
waltwhitman,The Unexpress'd
waltwhitman,How dare one say it?
waltwhitman,"After the cycles, poems, singers, plays,"
waltwhitman,"Vaunted Ionia's, India's--Homer, Shakspere--the long, long times'"
waltwhitman,"thick dotted roads, areas,"
waltwhitman,"The shining clusters and the Milky Ways of stars--Nature's pulses reap'd,"
waltwhitman,"All retrospective passions, heroes, war, love, adoration,"
waltwhitman,"All ages' plummets dropt to their utmost depths,"
waltwhitman,"All human lives, throats, wishes, brains--all experiences' utterance;"
waltwhitman,"After the countless songs, or long or short, all tongues, all lands,"
waltwhitman,"Still something not yet told in poesy's voice or print--something lacking,"
waltwhitman,(Who knows? the best yet unexpress'd and lacking.)
waltwhitman,Grand Is the Seen
waltwhitman,"Grand is the seen, the light, to me--grand are the sky and stars,"
waltwhitman,"Grand is the earth, and grand are lasting time and space,"
waltwhitman,"And grand their laws, so multiform, puzzling, evolutionary;"
waltwhitman,"But grander far the unseen soul of me, comprehending, endowing all those,"
waltwhitman,"Lighting the light, the sky and stars, delving the earth, sailing"
waltwhitman,"the sea,"
waltwhitman,"(What were all those, indeed, without thee, unseen soul? of what"
waltwhitman,amount without thee?)
waltwhitman,"More evolutionary, vast, puzzling, O my soul!"
waltwhitman,More multiform far--more lasting thou than they.
waltwhitman,Unseen Buds
waltwhitman,"Unseen buds, infinite, hidden well,"
waltwhitman,"Under the snow and ice, under the darkness, in every square or cubic inch,"
waltwhitman,"Germinal, exquisite, in delicate lace, microscopic, unborn,"
waltwhitman,"Like babes in wombs, latent, folded, compact, sleeping;"
waltwhitman,"Billions of billions, and trillions of trillions of them waiting,"
waltwhitman,(On earth and in the sea--the universe--the stars there in the
waltwhitman,"heavens,)"
waltwhitman,"Urging slowly, surely forward, forming endless,"
waltwhitman,"And waiting ever more, forever more behind."
waltwhitman,Good-Bye My Fancy!
waltwhitman,Good-bye my Fancy!
waltwhitman,"Farewell dear mate, dear love!"
waltwhitman,"I'm going away, I know not where,"
waltwhitman,"Or to what fortune, or whether I may ever see you again,"
waltwhitman,So Good-bye my Fancy.
waltwhitman,Now for my last--let me look back a moment;
waltwhitman,"The slower fainter ticking of the clock is in me,"
waltwhitman,"Exit, nightfall, and soon the heart-thud stopping."
waltwhitman,"Long have we lived, joy'd, caress'd together;"
waltwhitman,Delightful!--now separation--Good-bye my Fancy.
waltwhitman,"Yet let me not be too hasty,"
waltwhitman,"Long indeed have we lived, slept, filter'd, become really blended"
waltwhitman,into one;
waltwhitman,"Then if we die we die together, (yes, we'll remain one,)"
waltwhitman,"If we go anywhere we'll go together to meet what happens,"
waltwhitman,"May-be we'll be better off and blither, and learn something,"
waltwhitman,"May-be it is yourself now really ushering me to the true songs, (who"
waltwhitman,knows?)
waltwhitman,"May-be it is you the mortal knob really undoing, turning--so now finally,"
waltwhitman,Good-bye--and hail! my Fancy.
