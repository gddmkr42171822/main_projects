robertfrost,THE PLOUGHMAN
robertfrost,UNDER the long fell's stony eaves
robertfrost,"The ploughman, going up and down."
robertfrost,"Ridge after ridge man's tide-mark leaves,"
robertfrost,And turns the hard grey soil to brown.
robertfrost,"Striding, he measures out the earth"
robertfrost,"In lines of life, to rain and sun;"
robertfrost,And every year that comes to birth
robertfrost,Sees him still striding on and on.
robertfrost,"The seasons change, and then return ;"
robertfrost,"Yet still, in blind, unsparing ways,"
robertfrost,"However I may shrink or yearn,"
robertfrost,The ploughman measures out my days.
robertfrost,His acre brought forth roots last year;
robertfrost,This year it bears the gleamy grain ;
robertfrost,Next Spring shall seedling grass appear :
robertfrost,Then roots and corn and grass again.
robertfrost,Five times the young corn's pallid green
robertfrost,I have seen spread and change and thrill ;
robertfrost,Five times the reapers I have seen
robertfrost,Go creeping up the far-off hill :
robertfrost,"And, as the unknowing ploughman climbs"
robertfrost,"Slowly and inveterately,"
robertfrost,I wonder long how many times
robertfrost,The corn will spring again for me.

robertfrost,ATLANTIS
robertfrost,WHAT poets sang in Atlantis? Who can tell
robertfrost,The epics of Atlantis or their names ?
robertfrost,"The sea hath its own murmurs, and sounds not"
robertfrost,"The secrets of its silences beneath,"
robertfrost,And knows not any cadences enfolded
robertfrost,When the last bubbles of Atlantis broke
robertfrost,Among the quieting of its heaving floor.
robertfrost,"O, years and tides and leagues and all their billows"
robertfrost,Can alter not man's knowledge of men's hearts
robertfrost,While trees and rocks and clouds include our being
robertfrost,We know the epics of Atlantis still :
robertfrost,"A hero gave himself to lesser men,"
robertfrost,"Who first misunderstood and murdered him,"
robertfrost,And then misunderstood and worshipped him ;
robertfrost,"A woman was lovely and men fought for her,"
robertfrost,"Towns burnt for her, and men put men in bondage,"
robertfrost,But she put lengthier bondage on them all ;
robertfrost,A wanderer toiled among all the isles
robertfrost,"That fleck this turning star of shifting sea,"
robertfrost,"Or lonely purgatories of the mind,"
robertfrost,In longing for his home or his lost love.
robertfrost,Poetry is founded on the hearts of men :
robertfrost,Though in Nirvana or the Heavenly courts
robertfrost,"The principle of beauty shall persist,"
robertfrost,"Its body of poetry, as the body of man,"
robertfrost,"Is but a terrene form, a terrene use,"
robertfrost,That swifter being will not loiter with;
robertfrost,"And, when mankind is dead and the world cold,"
robertfrost,Poetry's immortality will pass.

robertfrost,THROUGH bare black oak-boughs spread afar
robertfrost,I watch a sickle moon
robertfrost,Follow a large and lonely star
robertfrost,Beyond the low South Down.

robertfrost,"The hard, lean fells against the night,"
robertfrost,Between the darker trees ;
robertfrost,The high and distant farm-house light;
robertfrost,The village stillnesses.

robertfrost,"As wind may be, among the bloom"

robertfrost,And stayed upon the fragrant hill
robertfrost,And lightened on the sea ;
robertfrost,And brushed the nettles nodding through
robertfrost,"The budding globes of cloudy may,"
robertfrost,And wavelike flowed upon the blue
robertfrost,Flowers of the woods.
robertfrost,It was a day

robertfrost,"Drifting along the sunlight, rare"
robertfrost,Of beauty as thoughts between friend and friend
robertfrost,"That have no cunning, but merely know"

robertfrost,"It was such a time at the birth of June,"

robertfrost,Far out from the city of broken hands.
robertfrost,"Meanly clad, with bodies worn,"

robertfrost,To cloistered shades
robertfrost,"They passed, from June light to June bower,"
robertfrost,"Tall men, and maids"
robertfrost,"Deep-bosomed, apt for any seed"
robertfrost,"That life should passionately sow,"
robertfrost,Yet pale and troubled of a creed
robertfrost,Cried out by men who nothing know
robertfrost,Of joy's diviner excellence.

robertfrost,"The tired forms. Ah, wellaway,"
robertfrost,Within so wide a peace to see

robertfrost,Defeated by ignoble use
robertfrost,And sullen dread.
robertfrost,"So in the sweet June-tide they slept,"
robertfrost,Nor any dream of healing deep
robertfrost,Came over them ; heart-sick they kept
robertfrost,A troubled sleep ;

robertfrost,"Their sleep was but remembered pain,"
robertfrost,And all their hunger but to be
robertfrost,Poor pilgrims in oblivion's train.
robertfrost,The stems each had a little shadow
robertfrost,"In the early afternoon,"

robertfrost,By a music long immured
robertfrost,In the central forest ways
robertfrost,"Where no human footfall strays,"
robertfrost,To the dreaming dance of June.
robertfrost,"One by one they woke, their faces"
robertfrost,"Still with some new wonder,"

robertfrost,"Fell a music very low,"
robertfrost,"Sweet with moving of the years,"
robertfrost,Burdened with the beat and flow
robertfrost,Of a garnered ecstasy
robertfrost,"Gathered from the deeps of pain,"
robertfrost,"Music vaster than the sea,"
robertfrost,Softer than the rain.
robertfrost,"Then they rose, the music played"
robertfrost,But a little way ahead.
robertfrost,And with never question made
robertfrost,They were well to follow. Red
robertfrost,And gold and opal flashed the noon
robertfrost,On lichened trunk. Their raiment mean
robertfrost,"Grew heavy in the dance of June,"
robertfrost,And man and maid among the green
robertfrost,"Unburdened them, and stood revealed"
robertfrost,"In clean unblushing loveliness,"
robertfrost,"Clear glowing limbs, all supple, steeled"
robertfrost,And shining ; many a streaming tress
robertfrost,"Slipped beautiful to breast and knee,"
robertfrost,"They proved a world where was no sin,"
robertfrost,"Exultant, pure in passion, free,"
robertfrost,Young captives bidden to begin
robertfrost,"New being. Sweet the music called,"

robertfrost,"To the music's chime,"
robertfrost,Reaping all the treasure
robertfrost,"Of the summer time,"
robertfrost,"Noiselessly along the glades,"
robertfrost,"Lithe white limbs all glancing,"
robertfrost,Comely men and comely maids
robertfrost,Drifted in their dancing.
robertfrost,"When chestnut cones were in the lanes,"
robertfrost,"Blushing, and eyed with ebony,"
robertfrost,And young oak-apples lovingly
robertfrost,Clung to their stems with rosy veins
robertfrost,Threading their glossy amber then
robertfrost,"They took them to faring, maids and men,"
robertfrost,"Whose eyes were dull with toiling, far"
robertfrost,"From their toil in the time of a perfecl: noon,"
robertfrost,"To where the quiet shadows are,"
robertfrost,And joined the dreaming dance of June.

robertfrost,Bdward Sastaway
robertfrost,OLD MAN
robertfrost,"OLD Man, or Lad's-love, in the name there's"
robertfrost,nothing
robertfrost,"To one that knows not Lad's-love, or Old Man,"
robertfrost,"The hoar-green feathery herb, almost a tree,"
robertfrost,Growing with rosemary and lavender.
robertfrost,"Even to one that knows it well, the names"
robertfrost,"Half decorate, half perplex, the thing it is :"
robertfrost,"At least, what that is clings not to the names"
robertfrost,In spite of time. And yet I like the names.
robertfrost,"The herb itself I like not, but for certain"
robertfrost,"I love it, as some day the child will love it"
robertfrost,Who plucks a feather from the door-side bush
robertfrost,Whenever she goes in or out of the house.
robertfrost,"Often she waits there, snipping the tips and shrivelling"
robertfrost,"The shreds at last on to the path, perhaps"
robertfrost,"Thinking, perhaps of nothing, till she sniffs"
robertfrost,Her fingers and runs off. The bush is still
robertfrost,"But half as tall as she, though it is as old;"
robertfrost,So well she clips it. Not a word she says ;
robertfrost,And I can only wonder how much hereafter
robertfrost,"She will remember, with that bitter scent,"
robertfrost,"Of garden rows, and ancient damson-trees"
robertfrost,"Topping a hedge, a bent path to a door,"
robertfrost,"A low thick bush beside the door, and me"
robertfrost,Forbidding her to pick.
robertfrost,"As for myself,"
robertfrost,Where first I met the bitter scent is lost.
robertfrost,37
robertfrost,Bdward Sastaway
robertfrost,"I, too, often shrivel the grey shreds,"
robertfrost,Sniff them and think and sniff again and try
robertfrost,"Once more to think what it is I am remembering,"
robertfrost,"Always in vain. I cannot like the scent,"
robertfrost,"Yet I would rather give up others more sweet,"
robertfrost,"With no meaning, than this bitter one."
robertfrost,I have mislaid the key. I sniff the spray
robertfrost,And think of nothing ; I see and I hear nothing ;
robertfrost,"Yet seem, too, to be listening, lying in wait"
robertfrost,"For what I should, yet never can, remember :"
robertfrost,"No garden appears, no path, no hoar-green bush"
robertfrost,"Of Lad's-love, or Old Man, no child beside,"
robertfrost,"Neither father nor mother, nor any playmate ;"
robertfrost,"Only an avenue, dark, nameless, without end."
robertfrost,Bdward Sastaway
robertfrost,SNOW
robertfrost,"IN the gloom of whiteness,"
robertfrost,"In the great silence of snow,"
robertfrost,A child was sighing
robertfrost,"And bitterly saying : "" Oh,"
robertfrost,"They have killed a white bird up there on her nest,"
robertfrost,"The down is fluttering from her breast."""
robertfrost,And still it fell through that dusky brightness
robertfrost,On the child crying for the bird of the snow.

robertfrost,"THAT 'S the cuckoo, you say. I cannot hear it."
robertfrost,When last I heard it I cannot recall ; but I know
robertfrost,Too well the year when first I failed to hear it
robertfrost,It was drowned by my man groaning out to his sheep
robertfrost,"""Ho! Ho!"""
robertfrost,Ten times with an angry voice he shouted
robertfrost,""" Ho! Ho! "" but not in anger, for that was his way."
robertfrost,"He died that Summer, and that is how I remember"
robertfrost,"The cuckoo calling, the children listening, and me say"
robertfrost,"ing, ""Nay."""
robertfrost,"And now, as you said, ""There it is"" I was hearing"
robertfrost,"Not the cuckoo at all, but my man's "" Ho ! Ho ! "" instead."
robertfrost,And I think that even if I could lose my deafness
robertfrost,The cuckoo's note would be drowned by the voice of my

robertfrost,THE NEW HOUSE
robertfrost,"NOW first, as I shut the door,"
robertfrost,I was alone
robertfrost,In the new house ; and the wind
robertfrost,Began to moan.
robertfrost,"Old at once was the house,"
robertfrost,And I was old ;
robertfrost,My ears were teased with the dread
robertfrost,"Of what was foretold,"
robertfrost,"Nights of storm, days of mist, without end ;"
robertfrost,Sad days when the sun
robertfrost,"Shone in vain : old griefs, and griefs"
robertfrost,Not yet begun.
robertfrost,All was foretold me ; naught
robertfrost,Could I foresee;
robertfrost,But I learnt how the wind would sound
robertfrost,After these things should be.
robertfrost,Sdward Sastaway
robertfrost,WIND AND MIST
robertfrost,"THEY met inside the gateway that gives the view,"
robertfrost,"A hollow land as vast as heaven. "" It is"
robertfrost,"A pleasant day, sir."" "" A very pleasant day."""
robertfrost,""" And what a view here. If you like angled fields"
robertfrost,"Of grass and grain bounded by oak and thorn,"
robertfrost,Here is a league. Had we with Germany
robertfrost,To play upon this board it could not be
robertfrost,More dear than April has made it with a smile.
robertfrost,The fields beyond that league close in together
robertfrost,"And merge, even as our days into the past,"
robertfrost,Into one wood that has a shining pane
robertfrost,Of water. Then the hills of the horizon
robertfrost,That is how I should make hills had I to show
robertfrost,"One who would never see them what hills were like."""
robertfrost,""" Yes. Sixty miles of South Downs at one glance."
robertfrost,"Sometimes a man feels proud at them, as if"
robertfrost,"He had just created them with one mighty thought."""
robertfrost,""" That house, though modern, could not be better"
robertfrost,planned
robertfrost,For its position. I never liked a new
robertfrost,"House better. Could you tell me who lives in it ? """
robertfrost,""" No one."" "" Ah and I was peopling all"
robertfrost,"Those windows on the south with happy eyes,"
robertfrost,The terrace under them with happy feet;
robertfrost,"Girls "" "" Sir, I know. I know. I have seen that"

robertfrost,"Through mist look lovely as a castle in Spain,"
robertfrost,42
robertfrost,Bdward Sastaway
robertfrost,And airier. 1 have thought: c 'Twere happy there
robertfrost,To live/ And I have laughed at that
robertfrost,"Because I lived there then."" ""Extraordinary."""
robertfrost,""" Yes, with my furniture and family"
robertfrost,"Still in it, I, knowing every nook of it"
robertfrost,"And loving none, and in fact hating it."""
robertfrost,""" Dear me ! How could that be ? But pardon me."""
robertfrost,""" No offence. Doubtless the house was not to blame,"
robertfrost,"But the eye watching from those windows saw,"
robertfrost,"Many a day, day after day, mist mist"
robertfrost,Like chaos surging back and felt itself
robertfrost,"Alone in all the world, marooned alone."
robertfrost,"We lived in clouds, on a cliff's edge almost"
robertfrost,"(You see), and if clouds went, the visible earth"
robertfrost,Lay too far off beneath and like a cloud.
robertfrost,I did not know it was the earth I loved
robertfrost,Until I tried to live there in the clouds
robertfrost,"And the earth turned to cloud."" "" You had a garden"
robertfrost,"Of flint and clay, too."" ""True; that was real enough."
robertfrost,The flint was the one crop that never failed.
robertfrost,"The clay first broke my heart, and then my back ;"
robertfrost,And the back heals not. There were other things
robertfrost,"Real, too. In that room at the gable a child"
robertfrost,Was born while the wind chilled a summer dawn :
robertfrost,Never looked grey mind on a greyer one
robertfrost,"Than when the child's cry broke above the groans."""
robertfrost,""" I hope they were both spared."" "" They were. Oh yes."
robertfrost,But flint and clay and childbirth were too real
robertfrost,For this cloud castle. I had forgot the wind.
robertfrost,Pray do not let me get on to the wind.
robertfrost,You would not understand about the wind.
robertfrost,"It is my subject, and compared with me"
robertfrost,Those who have always lived on the firm ground
robertfrost,Are quite unreal in this matter of the wind.
robertfrost,43
robertfrost,Edward Sastaway
robertfrost,There were whole days and nights when the wind and I
robertfrost,"Between us shared the world, and the wind ruled"
robertfrost,And I obeyed it and forgot the mist.
robertfrost,My past and the past of the world were in the wind.
robertfrost,Now you will say that though you understand
robertfrost,"And feel for me, and so on, you yourself"
robertfrost,Would find it different. You are all like that
robertfrost,If once you stand here free from wind and mist:
robertfrost,I might as well be talking to wind and mist.
robertfrost,You would believe the house-agent's young man
robertfrost,Who gives no heed to anything I say.
robertfrost,Good morning. But one word. I want to admit
robertfrost,"That I would try the house once more, if I could ;"
robertfrost,"As I should like to try being young again."""

robertfrost,"THERE are so many things I have forgot,"

robertfrost,"All lost, as is a childless woman's child"
robertfrost,"And its child's children, in the undefiled"
robertfrost,Abyss of what can never be again.
robertfrost,"I have forgot, too, names of the mighty men"
robertfrost,"That fought and lost or won in the old wars,"
robertfrost,"Of kings and fiends and gods, and most of the stars."
robertfrost,Some things I have forgot that I forget.
robertfrost,"But lesser things there are, remembered yet,"
robertfrost,Than all the others. One name that I have not
robertfrost,Though 'tis an empty thingless name forgot
robertfrost,Never can die because Spring after Spring
robertfrost,Some thrushes learn to say it as they sing.
robertfrost,There is always one at midday saying it clear
robertfrost,"And tart the name, only the name 1 hear."
robertfrost,While perhaps I am thinking of the elder scent
robertfrost,"That is like food, or while I am content"
robertfrost,"With the wild rose scent that is like memory,"

robertfrost,THE rain of a night and a day and a night
robertfrost,Stops at the light
robertfrost,Of this pale choked day. The peering sun
robertfrost,Sees what has been done.
robertfrost,The road under the trees has a border new
robertfrost,Of purple hue
robertfrost,Inside the border of bright thin grass :
robertfrost,For all that has
robertfrost,Been left by November of leaves is torn
robertfrost,From hazel and thorn
robertfrost,And the greater trees. Throughout the copse
robertfrost,No dead leaf drops
robertfrost,"On grey grass, green moss, burnt-orange fern."
robertfrost,At the wind's return :
robertfrost,The leaflets out of the ash-tree shed
robertfrost,Are thinly spread
robertfrost,"In the road, like little black fish, inlaid,"
robertfrost,As if they played.
robertfrost,What hangs from the myriad branches down there
robertfrost,So hard and bare
robertfrost,Is twelve yellow apples lovely to see
robertfrost,"On one crab-tree,"
robertfrost,And on each twig of every tree in the dell
robertfrost,Uncountable
robertfrost,Crystals both dark and bright of the rain
robertfrost,That begins again.
robertfrost,Sdward Sastaway
robertfrost,ASPENS
robertfrost,"ALL day and night, save winter, every weather,"
robertfrost,"Above the inn, the smithy, and the shop,"
robertfrost,The aspens at the cross-roads talk together
robertfrost,"Of rain, until their last leaves fall from the top."
robertfrost,Out of the blacksmith's cavern comes the ringing
robertfrost,"Of hammer, shoe, and anvil ; out of the inn"
robertfrost,"The clink, the hum, the roar, the random singing"
robertfrost,The sounds that for these fifty years have been.
robertfrost,"The whisper of the aspens is not drowned,"
robertfrost,"And over lightless pane and footless road,"
robertfrost,"Empty as sky, with every other sound"
robertfrost,"Not ceasing, calls their ghosts from their abode,"
robertfrost,"A silent smithy, a silent inn, nor fails"
robertfrost,"In the bare moonlight or the thick-furred gloom,"
robertfrost,"In tempest or the night of nightingales,"
robertfrost,To turn the cross-roads to a ghostly room.
robertfrost,And it would be the same were no house near.
robertfrost,"Over all sorts of weather, men, and times,"
robertfrost,Aspens must shake their leaves and men may hear
robertfrost,"But need not listen, more than to my rhymes."
robertfrost,"Whatever wind blows, while they and I have leaves"
robertfrost,We cannot other than an aspen be
robertfrost,"That ceaselessly, unreasonably grieves,"
robertfrost,Or so men think who like a different tree.

robertfrost,Where any brook so radiant racing clear
robertfrost,Through buttercup and kingcup bright as brass
robertfrost,"But gentle, nourishing the meadow grass"

robertfrost,"Another beauty, divine and feminine,"

robertfrost,"And yet, rid of this dream, ere I had drained"
robertfrost,"Its poison, quieted was my desire"
robertfrost,"So that I only looked into the water,"
robertfrost,"Clearer than any goddess or man's daughter,"
robertfrost,And hearkened while it combed the dark green hair
robertfrost,And shook the millions of the blossoms white
robertfrost,"Of water-crowfoot, and curdled to one sheet"
robertfrost,The flowers fallen from the chestnuts in the park
robertfrost,"Far off. And sedge-warblers, clinging so light"
robertfrost,"To willow twigs, sang longer than the lark,"
robertfrost,"Quick, shrill, or grating, a song to match the heat"
robertfrost,"Of the strong sun, nor less the water's cool,"
robertfrost,"Gushing through narrows, swirling in the pool."
robertfrost,"Their song that lacks all words, all melody,"
robertfrost,"All sweetness almost, was dearer then to me"

robertfrost,He proved to be the city come again
robertfrost,To look for something it had left behind
robertfrost,And could not do without and keep its Christmas.
robertfrost,He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees.
robertfrost,My woods the young fir-balsams like a place
robertfrost,Where houses all are churches and have spires.
robertfrost,I hadn't thought of them as Christmas trees.
robertfrost,I doubt if I was tempted for a moment
robertfrost,To sell them off their feet to go in cars
robertfrost,"And leave the slope behind the house all bare,"

robertfrost,Yet more I'd hate to hold my trees except
robertfrost,"As others hold theirs or refuse for them,"
robertfrost,"Beyond the time of profitable growth,"
robertfrost,The trial by market everything must come to.

robertfrost,A NEIGHBOR of mine in the village

robertfrost,"When she was a girl on the farm, she did"
robertfrost,A childlike thing.
robertfrost,One day she asked her father
robertfrost,To give her a garden plot
robertfrost,To plant and tend and reap herself
robertfrost,"And he said, ""Why not?"""
robertfrost,In casting about for a corner
robertfrost,He thought of an idle bit

robertfrost,"And he said, "" That ought to make you"
robertfrost,"An eyedeal one-girl farm,"

robertfrost,"On your slim-jim arm."""
robertfrost,"It was not enough of a garden,"
robertfrost,"Her father said, to plow."
robertfrost,"So she had to work it all by hand,"
robertfrost,But who cares now ?

robertfrost,DAFFODILS
robertfrost,HE liked the daffodils. He liked to see
robertfrost,Them nodding in the hedgerows cheerily
robertfrost,Along the dusty lanes as he went by
robertfrost,"Nodding and laughing to a fellow Ay,"
robertfrost,Nodding and laughing till you'ld almost think
robertfrost,"They, too, enjoyed the jest."
robertfrost,Without a wink
robertfrost,"That solemn butler said it, calm and smug,"
robertfrost,Deep- voiced as though he talked into a jug:
robertfrost,""" His lordship says he won't require no more"
robertfrost,Crocks rivetted or mended till the war
robertfrost,"Is over."""
robertfrost,Lord ! He'd asked to have a wire
robertfrost,The moment that his lordship should desire
robertfrost,To celebrate the occasion fittingly
robertfrost,By a wild burst of mending crockery
robertfrost,"Like a true Englishman, and hang expense!"
robertfrost,"He'd had to ask it, though he'd too much sense"
robertfrost,To lift a lash or breathe a word before
robertfrost,His lordship's lordship closed the heavy door.
robertfrost,"And then he'd laughed. Lord ! but it did him good,"
robertfrost,That quiet laugh. And somewhere in the wood
robertfrost,"Behind the Hall there, a woodpecker laughed"
robertfrost,Right out aloud as though he'd gone clean daft
robertfrost,"Right out aloud he laughed, the brazen bird,"
robertfrost,As if he didn't care a straw who heard
robertfrost,75
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,But then he'd not his daily bread to earn
robertfrost,By mending crocks.
robertfrost,And now at every turn
robertfrost,The daffodils were laughing quietly.
robertfrost,"Nodding and laughing to themselves, as he"
robertfrost,"Chuckled : Now there 's a patriot, real true-blue I"
robertfrost,It seemed the daffodils enjoyed it too
robertfrost,The fun of it. He wished that he could see
robertfrost,Old solemn-mug them laughing quietly
robertfrost,"At him. But then, he'ld never have a dim"
robertfrost,"Idea they laughed, and, least of all, at him."
robertfrost,He'ld never dream they could be laughing at
robertfrost,A butler.
robertfrost,'Twould be good to see the fat
robertfrost,Old peach-cheek in his solemn black and starch
robertfrost,Parading in his pompous parlour-march
robertfrost,Across that field of laughing daffodils.
robertfrost,"'Twould be a sight to make you skip up hills,"
robertfrost,"Ay, crutch and all, and never feel your pack,"
robertfrost,To see a butler in his starch and black
robertfrost,"Among the daffodils, ridiculous"
robertfrost,As that old bubbly-jock with strut and fuss
robertfrost,Though that was rather rough upon the bird !
robertfrost,"For all his pride, he didn't look absurd"
robertfrost,Among the flowers nor even that black sow
robertfrost,Grunting and grubbing in among them now.
robertfrost,And he was glad he hadn't got a trade
robertfrost,"That starched the mother-wit in you, and made"
robertfrost,A man look silly in a field of flowers.

robertfrost,"You hobbled on ay ! and, maybe for days"

robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson (jibs on
robertfrost,Without a job. And even when the sun
robertfrost,"Was shining, 'twas not altogether fun"
robertfrost,To lose the chance of earning a few pence
robertfrost,In these days : though 'twas well he'd got the sense
robertfrost,To see the funny side of things. It cost
robertfrost,"You nothing, laughing to yourself. You lost"
robertfrost,Far more by going fiddle-faced through life
robertfrost,Looking for trouble.
robertfrost,He would tell his wife
robertfrost,"When he got home. But lord, she'ld never see"
robertfrost,"What tickled him so mightily, not she!"
robertfrost,"She'ld only look up puzzled-like, and say"
robertfrost,"She didn't wonder at his lordship. Nay,"
robertfrost,With tripe and trotters at the price they were
robertfrost,You'd got to count your coppers and take care
robertfrost,Of every farthing.
robertfrost,Jack would see the fun
robertfrost,"Ay, Jack would see the joke. Jack was his son"
robertfrost,"The youngest of the lot. And, man-alive,"
robertfrost,'Twas queer that only one of all the five
robertfrost,Had got a twinkle in him all the rest
robertfrost,Dull as ditchwater to the merriest jest.
robertfrost,"Good lads enough they were, their mother's sons ;"
robertfrost,And they'd all pluck enough to face the guns
robertfrost,Out at the front. They'd got their mother's pluck :
robertfrost,"And he was proud of them, and wished them luck."
robertfrost,"That was no laughing matter though 'twas well,"
robertfrost,"Maybe, if you could crack a joke in hell,"
robertfrost,"And shame the devil. Jack, at least, would fight"
robertfrost,As well as any though his heart was light.
robertfrost,Jack was the boy for fighting and for fun;

robertfrost,W^ilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,"Who, even facing bloody death, would see"
robertfrost,"That little joke about the crockery,"
robertfrost,"And chuckle, as he charged."
robertfrost,His thoughts dropped back
robertfrost,Through eighteen years ; and he again saw Jack
robertfrost,"At the old home beneath the Malvern hills,"
robertfrost,"A little fellow plucking daffodils,"
robertfrost,"A little fellow who could scarcely walk,"
robertfrost,Yet chuckling as he snapped each juicy stalk
robertfrost,"And held up every yellow bloom to smell,"
robertfrost,Poking his tiny nose into the bell
robertfrost,"And sniffing its fresh scent, and chuckling still"
robertfrost,As though he'd secrets with each daffodil.
robertfrost,"Ay, he could see again the little fellow"
robertfrost,"In his blue frock among that laughing yellow,"
robertfrost,And plovers in their sheeny black and white
robertfrost,Flirting and tumbling in the morning light
robertfrost,"About his curly head. He still could see,"
robertfrost,"Shutting his eyes, as plain as plain could be,"
robertfrost,"Drift upon drift, those long-dead daffodils"
robertfrost,"Against the far green of the Malvern hills,"
robertfrost,"Nodding and laughing round his little lad,"
robertfrost,As if to see him happy made them glad
robertfrost,Nodding and laughing . . .
robertfrost,"They were nodding now,"
robertfrost,"The daffodils, and laughing yet, somehow,"
robertfrost,They didn't seem so merry now . . .
robertfrost,And he

robertfrost,"Of crushed wild garlic, as he thrust"

robertfrost,To bread and cheese and watched a pair

robertfrost,"Then running flirting tails in air,"

robertfrost,And plovers hovering over him
robertfrost,"In mazy, interweaving flight"
robertfrost,Until it made his young wits swim
robertfrost,"To see them up against the light,"
robertfrost,A dazzling maze of black and white
robertfrost,Against the clear blue April sky
robertfrost,Wings on wings in flashing flight

robertfrost,"Swooping, soaring, fluttering, flapping,"

robertfrost,Feeding on every side while he

robertfrost,A man must mind what he 's about
robertfrost,"And keep his silly wits awake,"
robertfrost,"Not go wool-gathering, if he'ld earn"

robertfrost,And fifteen mile to travel here was he
robertfrost,With nothing but an empty pipe to suck.
robertfrost,And half a flask of rum but that would be

robertfrost,Before he left ; and that would keep him warm
robertfrost,A tidy while : and 'twould be good to think
robertfrost,"He'd something to fall back on, if the storm"

robertfrost,"A sup of rain he didn't mind at all,"
robertfrost,But snow was different with so far to go
robertfrost,"Full fifteen mile, and not a house of call."
robertfrost,"Ay, snow was quite another story, quite"
robertfrost,Snow on these fell-tops with a north-east wind
robertfrost,"Behind it, blowing steadily with a bite"
robertfrost,That made you feel that you were stark and skinned.
robertfrost,And those poor beasts and they just off the boat
robertfrost,"A day or so, and hardly used to land"
robertfrost,"Still dizzy with the sea, their wits afloat."
robertfrost,"When they first reached the dock, they scarce could stand,"

robertfrost,"After a long day's jolting in the train,"

robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,"Of yapping dogs : and they stung mad with fear,"
robertfrost,Welted with switches by those senseless boys

robertfrost,"A beast's life, when you came to think of it"
robertfrost,"From start to finish queerer, ay, a lot"
robertfrost,"Then any man's, and chancier a good bit."
robertfrost,With his ash-sapling at their heels they'd got
robertfrost,To travel before night those fifteen miles
robertfrost,"Of hard fell-road, against the driving snow,"
robertfrost,"Half-blinded, on and on. He thought at whiles"
robertfrost,'Twas just as well for them they couldn't know . .
robertfrost,"Though, as for that, 'twas little that he knew"
robertfrost,Himself what was in store for him. He took
robertfrost,Things as they came. 'Twas all a man could do ;

robertfrost,"And here was he, with fifteen mile of fell,"
robertfrost,"And snow, and . . . God, but it was blowing stiff !"
robertfrost,And no tobacco. Blest if he could tell
robertfrost,"Where he had lost it but, for half a whiff"
robertfrost,He'ld swop the very jacket off his back

robertfrost,That held the holes together.
robertfrost,Thon Cheap-Jack
robertfrost,"Who'd sold it him, had said it was Lord Ted's,"
robertfrost,And London cut. But Teddy had grown fat

robertfrost,"Hell, but it was cold :"

robertfrost,"He'ld almost think he must be getting old,"
robertfrost,To feel the wind so. And long out of sight
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,"The beasts had trotted. Well, what odds ! The way"
robertfrost,"Ran straight for ten miles on, and they'ld go straight."
robertfrost,They'ld never heed a by-road. Many a day
robertfrost,"He'd had to trudge on, trusting them to fate,"
robertfrost,"And always found them safe. They scamper fast,"
robertfrost,But in the end a man could walk them down.
robertfrost,They're showy trotters ; but they cannot last.
robertfrost,He'ld race the fastest beast for half-a-crown
robertfrost,On a day's journey. Beasts were never made
robertfrost,"For steady travelling : drive them twenty mile,"
robertfrost,And they were done ; while he was not afraid
robertfrost,To tackle twice that distance with a smile.
robertfrost,But not a day like this ! He'd never felt
robertfrost,A wind with such an edge. 'Twas like the blade
robertfrost,Of the rasper in the pocket of his belt
robertfrost,He kept for easy shaving. In his trade
robertfrost,You'd oft to make your toilet under a dyke
robertfrost,"And he was always one for a clean chin,"
robertfrost,And carried soap.
robertfrost,He'd never felt the like
robertfrost,"That wind, it cut clean through him to the skin."
robertfrost,"He might be mother-naked, walking bare,"
robertfrost,"For all the use his clothes were, with the snow"
robertfrost,"Half-blinding him, and clagging to his hair,"
robertfrost,And trickling down his spine. He'ld like to know
robertfrost,"What was the sense of pegging steadily,"
robertfrost,"Chilled to the marrow, after a daft herd"
robertfrost,Of draggled beasts he couldn't even see !
robertfrost,"But that was him all over! Just a word,"
robertfrost,"A nod, a wink, the price of half-and-half"
robertfrost,"And he'ld be setting out for God-knows-where,"
robertfrost,85
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson (jibson
robertfrost,With no more notion than a yearling calf
robertfrost,Where he would find himself when he got there.
robertfrost,And he'd been travelling hard on sixty year
robertfrost,"The same old road, the same old giddy gait ;"
robertfrost,"And he'ld be walking, for a pint of beer,"
robertfrost,"Into his coffin, one day, soon or late"
robertfrost,"But not with such a tempest in his teeth,"
robertfrost,"Half-blinded and half-dothered, that he hoped !"
robertfrost,"He'd met a sight of weather on the heath,"
robertfrost,But this beat all.
robertfrost,'Twas worse than when he'd groped
robertfrost,His way that evening down the Mallerstang
robertfrost,"Thon was a blizzard, thon and he was done,"
robertfrost,And almost dropping when he came a bang
robertfrost,"Against a house slap-bang, and like to stun"
robertfrost,Though that just saved his senses and right there
robertfrost,"He saw a lighted window he'd not seen,"
robertfrost,Although he'd nearly staggered through its glare
robertfrost,"Into a goodwife's kitchen, where she'd been"
robertfrost,Baking hot girdle-cakes upon the peat.
robertfrost,"And he could taste them now, and feel the glow"
robertfrost,"Of steady, aching, tingly, drowsy heat,"
robertfrost,As he sat there and let the caking snow
robertfrost,"Melt off his boots, staining the sanded floor."
robertfrost,And that brown jug she took down from the shelf
robertfrost,"And every time he'd finished, fetching more,"
robertfrost,"And piping: ""Now reach up, and help yourself! """
robertfrost,"She was a wonder, thon, the gay old wife"
robertfrost,But no such luck this journey. Things like that
robertfrost,"Could hardly happen every day of life,"
robertfrost,"Or no one would be dying, but the fat"
robertfrost,"And oily undertakers, starved to death"
robertfrost,For want of custom . . . Hell ! but he would soon
robertfrost,"Be giving them a job ... It caught your breath,"
robertfrost,86
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,That throttling wind. And it was not yet noon ;
robertfrost,And held be travelling through it until dark.
robertfrost,"Dark? 'Twas already dark, and might be night"
robertfrost,For all that he could see ...
robertfrost,And not a spark
robertfrost,"Of comfort for him ! Just to strike a light,"
robertfrost,And press the kindling shag down in the bowl.
robertfrost,"Keeping the flame well-shielded by his hand,"
robertfrost,"And puff, and puff ! He'ld give his very soul"
robertfrost,For half-a-pipe. He couldn't understand
robertfrost,How he had come to lose it. He'd the rum
robertfrost,"Ay, that was safe enough : but it would keep"
robertfrost,"Awhile, you never knew what chance might come"
robertfrost,In such a storm . . .
robertfrost,If he could only sleep . . .
robertfrost,If he could only sleep . . . That rustling sound
robertfrost,"Of drifting snow, it made him sleepy-like"
robertfrost,"Drowsy and dizzy, dithering round and round . . ."
robertfrost,"If he could only curl up under a dyke,"
robertfrost,"And sleep and sleep ... It dazzled him, that white,"
robertfrost,"Drifting and drifting, round and round and round ."
robertfrost,Just half-a-moment's snooze . . . He'ld be all right.
robertfrost,"It made his head quite dizzy, that dry sound"
robertfrost,Of rustling snow. It made his head go round
robertfrost,"That rustling in his ears . . . and drifting, drifting ."
robertfrost,If he could only sleep ... he would sleep sound . . .
robertfrost,"God, he was nearly gone !"
robertfrost,The storm was lifting ;
robertfrost,And he'd run into something soft and warm
robertfrost,"Slap into his own beasts, and never knew."
robertfrost,"Huddled they were, bamboozled by the storm"
robertfrost,"And little wonder either, when it blew"
robertfrost,"A blasted blizzard. Still, they'd got to go."
robertfrost,They couldn't stand there snoozing until night.
robertfrost,8?
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,But they were sniffing something in the snow.
robertfrost,"'Twas that had stopped them, something big and white-"
robertfrost,"A bundle nay, a woman . . . and she slept."
robertfrost,But it was death to sleep.
robertfrost,He'd nearly dropt
robertfrost,Asleep himself. Twas well that he had kept
robertfrost,That rum ; and lucky that the beasts had stopt.
robertfrost,"Ay, it was well that he had kept the rum."
robertfrost,He liked his drink : but he had never cared
robertfrost,"For soaking by himself, and sitting mum."
robertfrost,"Even the best rum tasted better, shared."

robertfrost,IN THE MEADOW
robertfrost,THE smell of wet hay in the heat
robertfrost,"All morning steaming round him rose,"
robertfrost,"As, in a kind of nodding doze,"
robertfrost,"Perched on the hard and jolting seat,"
robertfrost,"He drove the rattling, jangling rake"
robertfrost,Round and around the Five Oaks Mead.
robertfrost,With that old mare he scarcely need
robertfrost,To drive at all or keep awake.
robertfrost,"Gazing with half-shut, sleepy eyes"
robertfrost,At her white flanks and grizzled tail
robertfrost,That flicked and flicked without avail
robertfrost,To drive away the cloud of flies
robertfrost,"That hovered, closing and unclosing,"
robertfrost,"A shimmering hum and humming shimmer,"
robertfrost,Dwindling dim and ever dimmer
robertfrost,"In his dazzled sight, till, dozing,"
robertfrost,He seemed to hear a murmuring stream
robertfrost,And gaze into a rippling pool
robertfrost,Beneath thick branches dark and cool
robertfrost,"And gazing, gazing till a gleam"
robertfrost,"Within the darkness caught his eyes,"
robertfrost,He saw there smiling up at him
robertfrost,"A young girl's face, now rippling dim,"
robertfrost,Now flashing clear . . .
robertfrost,Without surprise
robertfrost,"He marked the eyes translucent blue,"
robertfrost,"The full red lips that seemed to speak,"
robertfrost,"The curves of rounded chin and cheek,"
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson (jibson
robertfrost,"The low, broad brow, sun-tanned . . ."
robertfrost,He knew
robertfrost,"That face, yet could not call to mind"
robertfrost,Where he had seen it; and in vain
robertfrost,Strove to recall . . .when sudden rain
robertfrost,"Crashed down and made the clear pool blind,"
robertfrost,And it was lost . . .
robertfrost,"And, with a jerk"
robertfrost,"That well-nigh shook him from his seat,"
robertfrost,He wakened to the steamy heat
robertfrost,And clank and rattle.
robertfrost,Still at work
robertfrost,The stolid mare kept on ; and still
robertfrost,"Over her hot, white flanks the flies"
robertfrost,Hung humming. And his dazzled eyes
robertfrost,"Closed gradually again, until"
robertfrost,He dozed . . .
robertfrost,And stood within the door
robertfrost,"Of Dinchill dairy, drinking there"
robertfrost,Thirst-quenching draughts of stone-cold air
robertfrost,The scoured white shelves and sanded floor
robertfrost,And shallow milk-pans creamy white
robertfrost,Gleamed coldly in the dusky light . . .
robertfrost,"And then he saw her, stooping down"
robertfrost,"Over a milk-pan, while her eyes"
robertfrost,Looked up at him without surprise
robertfrost,Over the shoulder of her gown
robertfrost,Her fresh print gown of speedwell blue . . .
robertfrost,The eyes that looked out of the cool
robertfrost,Untroubled crystal of the pool
robertfrost,Looked into his again.
robertfrost,He knew
robertfrost,Those eyes now . . .
robertfrost,From his dreamy doze
robertfrost,90
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,A sudden jolting of the rake
robertfrost,Aroused him.
robertfrost,"Startled, broad awake"
robertfrost,"He sat upright, lost in amaze"
robertfrost,That he should dream of her that lass !
robertfrost,And see her face within the pool!
robertfrost,"He'd known her always. Why, at school"
robertfrost,They'd sat together in the class.
robertfrost,"He'd always liked her well enough,"
robertfrost,Young Polly Dale and they had played
robertfrost,"At Prisoners' Base and Who's Afraid,"
robertfrost,"At Tiggy and at Blindman's Buff,"
robertfrost,A hundred times together . . .
robertfrost,"Ay,"
robertfrost,"He'd always known her ... It was strange,"
robertfrost,Though he had noticed that a change
robertfrost,"Had come upon her she was shy,"
robertfrost,"And quieter, since she left school"
robertfrost,And put her hair up he'd not seen
robertfrost,"Her face, till from the glancing sheen"
robertfrost,It looked up at him from the pool . . .
robertfrost,"He'd always known her. Every day,"
robertfrost,He'd nod to her as they would pass.
robertfrost,He'd always known her as a lass . . .
robertfrost,He'ld never know her just that way
robertfrost,Again now . . .
robertfrost,In a different wise
robertfrost,They'ld meet for how could he forget
robertfrost,His dream . . . The next time that they met
robertfrost,He'ld look into a woman's eyes.

robertfrost,THE PLATELAYER
robertfrost,HHAPPING the rails as he went by
robertfrost,"1 And driving the slack wedges tight,"
robertfrost,He walked towards the morning sky
robertfrost,Between two golden lines of light
robertfrost,That dwindled slowly into one
robertfrost,Sheer golden rail that ran right on
robertfrost,Over the fells into the sun.
robertfrost,"And dazzling in his eyes it shone,"
robertfrost,"That golden track, as left and right"
robertfrost,"He swung his clinking hammer ay,"
robertfrost,'Twas dazzling after that long night
robertfrost,"In Hindfell tunnel, working by"
robertfrost,"A smoky flare, and making good"
robertfrost,The track the rains had torn . . .
robertfrost,"Clink, clink,"
robertfrost,On the sound metal on the wood
robertfrost,A duller thwack !
robertfrost,"It made him blink,"
robertfrost,That running gold . . .
robertfrost,'Twas sixteen hours
robertfrost,Since he'd left home his garden smelt
robertfrost,So fragrant with the heavy showers
robertfrost,When he left home and now he felt
robertfrost,That it would smell more fresh and sweet
robertfrost,After the tunnel's reek and fume
robertfrost,Of damp warm cinders. 'Twas a treat
robertfrost,To come upon the scent and bloom
robertfrost,92
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Cfibson
robertfrost,That topped the cutting by the wood
robertfrost,After the cinders of the track.
robertfrost,The cinders and tarred sleepers good
robertfrost,To lift your eyes from gritty black
robertfrost,Upon that blaze of green and red . . .
robertfrost,"And she'ld be waiting by the fence,"
robertfrost,And with the baby . . .
robertfrost,Straight for bed
robertfrost,"He'ld make, if he had any sense,"
robertfrost,"And sleep the day; but, like as not,"
robertfrost,"When he'd had breakfast, he'ld turn to"
robertfrost,And hoe the back potato-plot :
robertfrost,'Twould be one mass of weeds he knew.
robertfrost,You'ld think each single drop of rain
robertfrost,"Turned, as it fell, into a weed."
robertfrost,You seemed to hoe and hoe in vain.
robertfrost,Chickweed and groundsel didn't heed
robertfrost,"The likes of him and bindweed, well,"
robertfrost,You hoed and hoed still its white roots
robertfrost,Ran deeper . . .
robertfrost,'Twould be good to smell
robertfrost,"The fresh-turned earth, and feel his boots"
robertfrost,"Sink deep into the brown wet mould,"
robertfrost,After hard cinders . . .
robertfrost,"And, maybe,"
robertfrost,"The baby, sleeping good as gold"
robertfrost,"In its new carriage under a tree,"
robertfrost,"Would keep him company, while his wife"
robertfrost,Washed up the breakfast-things.
robertfrost,"'Twas strange,"
robertfrost,"The difference that she made to life,"
robertfrost,That tiny baby-girl.
robertfrost,The change
robertfrost,Of work would make him sleep more sound.
robertfrost,93
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,'Twas sleep he needed. That long night
robertfrost,Shovelling wet cinders underground.
robertfrost,With breaking back the smoky light
robertfrost,Stinging his eyes till they were sore . . .
robertfrost,"He'd worked the night that she was born,"
robertfrost,Standing from noon the day before
robertfrost,All through that winter's night till morn
robertfrost,Laying fog-signals on the line
robertfrost,Where it ran over Devil's Ghyll . . .
robertfrost,"And she was born at half-past nine,"
robertfrost,Just as he stood aside until
robertfrost,The Scots' Express ran safely by ...
robertfrost,He'd but to shut his eyes to see
robertfrost,Those windows flashing blindingly
robertfrost,A moment through the blizzard he
robertfrost,Could feel again that slashing snow
robertfrost,That seemed to cut his face.
robertfrost,"But they,"
robertfrost,"The passengers, they couldn't know"
robertfrost,What it cost him to keep the way
robertfrost,Open for them. So snug and warm
robertfrost,"They slept or chattered, while he stood"
robertfrost,And faced all night that raking storm
robertfrost,The little house beside the wood
robertfrost,"For ever in his thoughts : and he,"
robertfrost,Not knowing what was happening . . .
robertfrost,But all went well as well could be
robertfrost,With Sally and the little thing.
robertfrost,And it had been worth while to wait
robertfrost,"Through that long night with work to do,"
robertfrost,To meet his mother at the gate
robertfrost,94
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,"With such good news, and find it true,"
robertfrost,"Ay, truer than the truth."
robertfrost,He still
robertfrost,Could see his wife's eyes as he bent
robertfrost,Over the bairn . . .
robertfrost,The Devil's Ghyll
robertfrost,"Had done its worst, and he was spent ;"
robertfrost,But he'ld have faced a thousand such
robertfrost,"Wild nights as thon, to see that smile"
robertfrost,"Again, and feel that tender touch"
robertfrost,Upon his cheek.
robertfrost,'Twas well worth while
robertfrost,"With such reward. And it was strange,"
robertfrost,The difference such a little thing
robertfrost,Could make to them how it could change
robertfrost,"Their whole life for them, and could bring"
robertfrost,"Such happiness to them, though they"
robertfrost,Had seemed as happy as could be
robertfrost,Before it came to them.
robertfrost,The day
robertfrost,"Was shaping well. And there was she,"
robertfrost,The lassie sleeping quietly
robertfrost,"Within her arms, beside the gate."
robertfrost,The storm had split that lilac tree.
robertfrost,"But he was tired, and it must wait."
robertfrost,95
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,MAKESHIFTS
robertfrost,"AND after all, 'twas snug and weather-tight,"
robertfrost,His garret. That was much on such a night
robertfrost,To be secure against the wind and sleet
robertfrost,"At his age, and not wandering the street,"
robertfrost,"A shuffling, shivering bag-of-bones."
robertfrost,And yet
robertfrost,Things would be snugger if he could forget
robertfrost,The bundle of old dripping rags that slouched
robertfrost,"Before him down the Canongate, that crouched"
robertfrost,Close to the swing-doors of the Spotted Cow.
robertfrost,"Why, he could see that poor old sinner now,"
robertfrost,"Ay ! and could draw him, if he'd had the knack"
robertfrost,"Of drawing anything a steamy, black"
robertfrost,"Dilapidation, basking in the glare,"
robertfrost,And sniffing with his swollen nose in air
robertfrost,To catch the hot reek when the door swings wide
robertfrost,"And shows the glittering paradise inside,"
robertfrost,Where men drink golden fire on seats of plush
robertfrost,Lolling like gods : he stands there in the slush
robertfrost,"Shivering, from squelching boots to sopping hat"
robertfrost,"One sodden clout, and blinking like a bat"
robertfrost,Be-dazzled by the blaze of light : his beard
robertfrost,Waggles and drips from lank cheeks pocked and seared ;
robertfrost,"And the whole dismal night about him drips,"
robertfrost,As he stands gaping there with watering lips
robertfrost,"And burning eyes in the cold sleety drench,"
robertfrost,Afire with thirst that only death may quench.
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Cfibson
robertfrost,Yet he had clutched the sixpence greedily
robertfrost,As if sixpennyworth of rum maybe
robertfrost,Would satisfy that thirst. Who knows ! It might
robertfrost,Just do the trick perhaps on such a night.
robertfrost,"And death would be a golden, fiery drink"
robertfrost,To that old scarecrow. 'Twould be good to think
robertfrost,"His money'd satisfied that thirst, and brought"
robertfrost,Rest to those restless fevered bones that ought
robertfrost,Long since to have dropped for ever out of sight.
robertfrost,"It wasn't decent, wandering the night"
robertfrost,Like that not decent. While it lived it made
robertfrost,"A man turn hot to see it, and afraid"
robertfrost,To look it in the face lest he should find
robertfrost,"That bundle was himself, grown old and blind"
robertfrost,With thirst unsatisfied.
robertfrost,"He'd thirsted, too,"
robertfrost,"His whole life long, though not for any brew"
robertfrost,That trickled out of taps in gaudy bars
robertfrost,For those with greasy pence to spend !
robertfrost,The stars
robertfrost,"Were not for purchase, neither bought nor sold"
robertfrost,By any man for silver or for gold.
robertfrost,"Still, he was snug and sheltered from the storm."
robertfrost,"He sat by his own hearth secure and warm,"
robertfrost,And that was much indeed on such a night.
robertfrost,The little room was pleasant with the light
robertfrost,"Glowing on lime-washed walls, kindling to red"
robertfrost,"His copper pots, and, over the white bed,"
robertfrost,The old torn Rembrandt print to golden gloom.
robertfrost,'Twas much on such a night to have a room
robertfrost,Four walls and ceiling storm-tight overhead.
robertfrost,"Denied the stars well, you must spend instead"
robertfrost,97
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Cjibson
robertfrost,Your sixpences on makeshifts. Life was naught
robertfrost,But toiling for the sixpences that bought
robertfrost,Makeshifts for stars.
robertfrost,'Twas snug to hear the sleet
robertfrost,Lashing the panes and sweeping down the street
robertfrost,Towards Holyrood and out into the night
robertfrost,Of hills beyond. Maybe it would be white
robertfrost,"On Arthur's seat to-morrow, white with snow"
robertfrost,A white hill shining in the morning glow
robertfrost,"Beyond the chimney-pots, that was a sight"
robertfrost,For any man to see a snowy height
robertfrost,"Soaring into the sunshine. He was glad,"
robertfrost,"Though he must live in slums, his garret had"
robertfrost,A window to the hills.
robertfrost,"And he was warm,"
robertfrost,"Ay, warm and snug, shut in here from the storm."
robertfrost,The sixpences bought comfort for old bones
robertfrost,That else must crouch all night on paving-stones
robertfrost,Unsheltered from the cold.
robertfrost,'Twas hard to learn
robertfrost,In his young days that this was life to earn
robertfrost,By life-long labour just your board and bed
robertfrost,"Although the stars were singing overhead,"
robertfrost,The sons of morning singing together for joy
robertfrost,As they had sung for every bright-eyed boy
robertfrost,With ears to hear since life itself was young
robertfrost,"And leave so much unseen, so much unsung."
robertfrost,He'd had to learn that lesson. 'Twas no good
robertfrost,To go star-gazing for a livelihood
robertfrost,With empty belly. Though he had a turn
robertfrost,"For seeing things, when you have got to earn"
robertfrost,"Your daily bread first, there is little time"
robertfrost,To paint your dream or set the stars to rhyme:
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Cjibson
robertfrost,"Nay, though you have the vision and the skill"
robertfrost,You cannot draw the outline of a hill
robertfrost,"To please yourself, when you get home half-dead"
robertfrost,After the day's work hammers in your head
robertfrost,"Still tapping, tapping . . ."
robertfrost,Always mad to draw
robertfrost,The living shape of everything he saw
robertfrost,He'd had to spend his utmost skill and strength
robertfrost,"Learning a trade to live by, till at length"
robertfrost,Now he'd the leisure the old skill was dead.
robertfrost,"Born for a painter as it seemed, instead"
robertfrost,He'd spent his life upholstering furniture.
robertfrost,'Twas natural enough men should prefer
robertfrost,"Upholstery to pictures, and their ease"
robertfrost,To little coloured daubs of cows and trees.
robertfrost,"He didn't blame them, 'twas no fault of theirs"
robertfrost,"That they saw life in terms of easy chairs,"
robertfrost,"And heaven, like that old sinner in the slush,"
robertfrost,A glittering bar upholstered in red plush.
robertfrost,"'Twas strange to look back on it now, his life . . ."
robertfrost,"His father, married to a second wife ;"
robertfrost,"And home, no home for him since he could mind,"
robertfrost,Save when the starry vision made him blind
robertfrost,"To all about him, and he walked on air"
robertfrost,"For days together, and without a care . . ."
robertfrost,"But as the years passed, seldomer they came"
robertfrost,"Those starry dazzling nights and days aflame,"
robertfrost,And oftener a sudden gloom would drop
robertfrost,"Upon him, drudging all day in the shop"
robertfrost,With his young brother John John always gay
robertfrost,"Taking things as they came, the easy way,"
robertfrost,99
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson
robertfrost,Not minding overmuch if things went wrong
robertfrost,"At home, and always humming a new song . . ."
robertfrost,"And then she came into his life, and shook"
robertfrost,All heaven about him. He had but to look
robertfrost,On her to find the stars within his reach.
robertfrost,"But, ere his love had trembled into speech,"
robertfrost,He'd waked one day to know that not for him
robertfrost,Were those bright living eyes that turned dreams dim
robertfrost,"To know that while he'd worshipped, John and she"
robertfrost,Had taken to each other easily . . .
robertfrost,But that was years ago . . . and now he sat
robertfrost,Beside a lonely hearth. And they were fat
robertfrost,"Ay, fat and old they were, John and his wife,"
robertfrost,And with a grown-up family. Their life
robertfrost,Had not been over-easy : they'd their share
robertfrost,"Of trouble, ay, more than enough to spare :"
robertfrost,"But they had made the best of things, and taken"
robertfrost,Life as it came with courage still unshaken.
robertfrost,"They'd faced their luck, but never gone half-way"
robertfrost,To meet fresh trouble. Life was always gay
robertfrost,For them between the showers : the roughest weather
robertfrost,Might do its worst they always stood together
robertfrost,"To bear the brunt, together stood their ground"
robertfrost,And came through smiling cheerfully. They'd found
robertfrost,"Marriage a hard-up, happy business"
robertfrost,Of hand-to-mouth existence more or less ;
robertfrost,"But taking all in all, well worth their while"
robertfrost,To look on the bright side of things to smile
robertfrost,"When all went well, not fearing overmuch"
robertfrost,When life was suddenly brought to the touch
robertfrost,"And you'd to sink or swim. And they'd kept hold,"
robertfrost,100
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,"And even now, though they were fat and old"
robertfrost,They'd still a hearty grip on life . . .
robertfrost,They'ld be
robertfrost,Sitting there in their kitchen after tea
robertfrost,On either side the fire-place even now
robertfrost,"Jane with her spectacles upon her brow,"
robertfrost,"And nodding as she knitted, listening"
robertfrost,"While John, in shirt-sleeves, scraped his fiddle-string,"
robertfrost,With one ear hearkening lest a foot should stop
robertfrost,And some rare customer invade the shop
robertfrost,To ask the price of that old Flanders' chest
robertfrost,Or oaken ale-house settle . . .
robertfrost,They'd the best
robertfrost,"Of life, maybe, together . . ."
robertfrost,And yet he
robertfrost,"Though he'd not taken life so easily,"
robertfrost,"Had always hated makeshifts more or less,"
robertfrost,"Grudging to swop the stars for sixpences,"
robertfrost,"And was an old man now, with that old thirst"
robertfrost,"Unsatisfied ay, even at the worst"
robertfrost,"He'd had his compensations, now and then"
robertfrost,A starry glimpse. You couldn't work with men
robertfrost,And quite forget the stars. Though life was spent
robertfrost,"In drudgery, it hadn't only meant"
robertfrost,Upholstering chairs in crimson plush for bars . . .
robertfrost,"Maybe it gave new meaning to the stars,"
robertfrost,"The drudgery, who knows!"
robertfrost,At least the rare
robertfrost,Wild glimpses he had caught at whiles were there
robertfrost,Yet living in his mind. When much was dim
robertfrost,"And drudgery forgotten, bright for him"
robertfrost,Burned even now in memory old delights
robertfrost,That had been his in other days and nights.
robertfrost,"He'd always seen, though never could express"
robertfrost,101
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,"His eyes' delight, or only more or less :"
robertfrost,"But things once clearly seen, once and for all"
robertfrost,The soul's possessions naught that may befall
robertfrost,"May ever dim, and neither moth nor rust"
robertfrost,"Corrupt the dream, that, shedding mortal dust,"
robertfrost,Has soared to life and spread its wings of gold
robertfrost,Within the soul . . .
robertfrost,"And yet when they were told,"
robertfrost,"These deathless visions, little things they seemed"
robertfrost,Though something of the beauty he had dreamed
robertfrost,"Burned in them, something of his youth's desire . . ,"
robertfrost,"And as he sat there, gazing at the fire"
robertfrost,"Once more he lingered, listening in the gloom"
robertfrost,"Of that great silent warehouse, in the room"
robertfrost,"Where stores were kept, one hand upon a shelf,"
robertfrost,And heard a lassie singing to herself
robertfrost,"Somewhere unseen without a thought who heard,"
robertfrost,Just singing to herself like any bird
robertfrost,"Because the heart was happy in her breast,"
robertfrost,As happy as the day was long. At rest
robertfrost,"He lingered, listening, and a ray of light"
robertfrost,Streamed from the dormer-window up a height
robertfrost,"Down on the bales of crimson cloth, and lit"
robertfrost,"To sudden gold the dust that danced in it,"
robertfrost,Till he was dazzled by the golden motes
robertfrost,That kept on dancing to those merry notes
robertfrost,"Before his dreaming eyes, and danced as long"
robertfrost,As he stood listening to the lassie's song . . .
robertfrost,"Then once again, his work-bag on his back,"
robertfrost,He climbed that April morning up the track
robertfrost,That took him by a short cut through the wood
robertfrost,"Up to the hill-top where the great house stood,"
robertfrost,IO2
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson (jibson
robertfrost,When suddenly beyond the firs' thick night
robertfrost,He saw a young fawn frisking in the light :
robertfrost,Shaking the dew-drops in a silver rain
robertfrost,"From off his dappled hide, he leapt again"
robertfrost,As though he'ld jump out of his skin for joy.
robertfrost,With laughing eyes light-hearted as a boy
robertfrost,He watched the creature unaware of him
robertfrost,"Quivering with eager life in every limb,"
robertfrost,Leaping and frisking on the dewy green
robertfrost,"Beneath the flourish of the snowy gean,"
robertfrost,While every now and then the long ears pricked
robertfrost,"And budding horns, as he leapt higher, flicked"
robertfrost,"The drooping clusters of wild-cherry bloom,"
robertfrost,Shaking the snow about him. From the gloom
robertfrost,"Of those dark wintry firs, his eyes had won"
robertfrost,A sight of April sporting in the sun
robertfrost,Young April leaping to its heart's delight
robertfrost,Among the dew beneath the boughs of white . . .
robertfrost,"And there'd been days among the hills, rare days"
robertfrost,And rarer nights among the heathery ways
robertfrost,Rare golden holidays when he had been
robertfrost,Alone in the great solitude of green
robertfrost,"Wave-crested hills, a rolling shoreless sea"
robertfrost,Flowing for ever through eternity
robertfrost,"A sea of grasses, streaming without rest"
robertfrost,"Beneath the great wind blowing from the west,"
robertfrost,Over which cloud shadows sailed and swept away
robertfrost,Beyond the world's edge all the summer day.
robertfrost,"The hills had been his refuge, his delight,"
robertfrost,"Seen or unseen, through many a day or night."
robertfrost,"His help was of the hills, steadfast, serene"
robertfrost,103
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson Qibson
robertfrost,"In their eternal strength, those shapes of green"
robertfrost,Sublimely moulded.
robertfrost,Whatsoever his skill.
robertfrost,No man hath ever rightly drawn a hill
robertfrost,To his mind never caught the subtle curves
robertfrost,Of sweeping moorland with its dips and swerves-
robertfrost,Nor ever painted heather . . .
robertfrost,Heather came
robertfrost,"Always into his mind like sudden flame,"
robertfrost,Blazing and streaming over stony braes
robertfrost,As he had seen it on that day of days
robertfrost,"When he had plunged into a sea of bloom,"
robertfrost,"Blinded with colour, stifled with the fume"
robertfrost,"Of sun-soaked blossom, the hot heady scent"
robertfrost,"Of honey-breathing bells, and sunk content"
robertfrost,Into a soft and scented bed to sleep ;
robertfrost,"And he had lain in slumber sweet and deep,"
robertfrost,And only wakened when the full moon's light
robertfrost,Had turned that wavy sea of heather white :
robertfrost,And still he'd lain within the full moon blaze
robertfrost,Hour after hour bewildered and adaze
robertfrost,As though enchanted in a waking swoon
robertfrost,He'd lain within the full glare of the moon
robertfrost,Until she seemed to shine on him alone
robertfrost,In all the world as though his body'd grown
robertfrost,"Until it covered all the earth, and he"
robertfrost,Was swaying like the moon-enchanted sea
robertfrost,Beneath that cold white witchery of light ...
robertfrost,"And now, the earth itself, he hung in night"
robertfrost,Turning and turning in that cold white glare
robertfrost,For ever and for ever . . . .
robertfrost,She was there
robertfrost,"There at his window now, the moon. The sleet"
robertfrost,And wind no longer swept the quiet street.
robertfrost,104
robertfrost,Wilfrid Wilson (jibson
robertfrost,And he was cold : the fire had burnt quite low :
robertfrost,"And, while he'd dreamt, there'd been a fall of snow."
robertfrost,He wondered where that poor old man would hide
robertfrost,His head to-night with thirst unsatisfied . . .
robertfrost,His thirst who knows ! but night may quench the thirst
robertfrost,Day leaves unsatisfied . . .
robertfrost,"Well, he must first"
robertfrost,"Get to his bed and sleep away the night,"
robertfrost,If he would rise to see the hills still white
robertfrost,In the first glory of the morning light.

robertfrost,When thither came six hundred men of Dan ;
robertfrost,"From Eshtaol hailed some, from Zorah others ;"
robertfrost,"And most were fully armed ; for, near their brothers,"
robertfrost,No longer was there place or land to till ;
robertfrost,So they had sent forth five of might and skill
robertfrost,To search them out a vale for heritage.
robertfrost,These spies chose Laish ; warless a long age
robertfrost,"Its folk dwelt careless, as the manner holds"
robertfrost,"With the Zidonians, safe as sheep in folds,"
robertfrost,Apart from all men else ; in genial state
robertfrost,They pleased themselves without a magistrate
robertfrost,Who might put men to shame for doing wrong.
robertfrost,"Those five now lead forth Dan, six hundred strong."
robertfrost,And having noted 'gainst the present day
robertfrost,"What by the road most promised profit, they"
robertfrost,109
robertfrost,T. Sturge ZMoore
robertfrost,"Called a halt here, not for that water's sake,"
robertfrost,Nor to buy milk their children's fast to break :
robertfrost,They had no honest cause to stop at all.
robertfrost,Though Micah's house stood back across a court
robertfrost,His Levite's lattice pierced the outer wall
robertfrost,And was the sooth- and charm-buyer's resort.
robertfrost,"Talking they stopped ; the priest was bound to hear,"
robertfrost,"His ears waked up by Shibboleths, full dear"
robertfrost,"Since Bethlehem his home bordered on theirs,"
robertfrost,"(Though he had not been near it now for years,"
robertfrost,"But, having found a place, he served this man"
robertfrost,"Who owned an house of gods). Those five of Dan,"
robertfrost,"Though they before had been his master's guests,"
robertfrost,"Now, while he questioned of those parts loved most,"
robertfrost,"Of all that, where he first was happy, rests,"
robertfrost,"Crossed the paved court, but did not hail their host ;"
robertfrost,"Like boys who climb to where the wild hawk nests,"
robertfrost,"Neared hushed, and mute unto his God's house went."
robertfrost,His Ephod and the Teraphim which leant
robertfrost,By either post to guard the door they took;
robertfrost,"Glanced round like boys who for due vengeance look,"
robertfrost,Dogged by dreamed whirr of wings ; bold then did
robertfrost,"seize,"
robertfrost,"Molten and graven, both his images."
robertfrost,"This quickly done, they hastened to their friends."
robertfrost,"And meanwhile Micah through his vineyard wends,"
robertfrost,His mind unflecked by thought of guile or hate
robertfrost,To where his servants dig a goodly vat.
robertfrost,He means to see the floor well-grooved and flat.
robertfrost,"""What do ye ? "" said the Levite at the gate."
robertfrost,"The five made ready answer "" Be thou dumb !"
robertfrost,Lay thou thy hand upon thy mouth and come !
robertfrost,Shall we not need a father and a priest ?
robertfrost,1 10
robertfrost,T. Sturge ^Moore
robertfrost,Whether is best for thee to serve one man
robertfrost,Or a whole tribe ? Is the advantage least
robertfrost,"Thou spiest with us ? "" Then in the midst of Dan,"
robertfrost,"Charged with the gods and ephod, pleased at once,"
robertfrost,"That Levite went. Putting their little ones,"
robertfrost,"Women and carts before them, all moved on."
robertfrost,Of Micah's maids no few watched what was done ;
robertfrost,"Who, when those men were not so nigh to hear,"
robertfrost,Ventured beyond the threshold ; wan with fear
robertfrost,Ran down among the vines and raised the cry
robertfrost,As then was wont ; they pitched it shrill and high.
robertfrost,Listen ! a thing of price
robertfrost,Is stolen is lost has gone !
robertfrost,He who to find it tries
robertfrost,"Shall be well looked upon,"
robertfrost,He who will stop the thieves
robertfrost,His courage shall be showed !
robertfrost,Follow them by the shaking of the leaves
robertfrost,Follow them by the dust above the road !
robertfrost,Gird on the sword Take down the spear !
robertfrost,Ye who are not cowards
robertfrost,"Who own good names, who hold them dear"
robertfrost,An evil act is towards !
robertfrost,That workers of iniquity may tremble
robertfrost,Hither assemble !
robertfrost,"Now Micah heard : and, conscious he was rich,"
robertfrost,Harassed by shrewd surmises that would twitch
robertfrost,"Its leading strings and bring his heart to stand,"
robertfrost,"Made toward the sound, soon met a white-faced girl"
robertfrost,"Who gaped upon him, till his short command"
robertfrost,Loosed her numb tongue and checked her senses' whirl
robertfrost,To pour his losses on him ; though more fast
robertfrost,"Her eyes outran her words, which being passed"
robertfrost,in
robertfrost,7*. Sturge ZMoore
robertfrost,"Told what was known, yet only told it half."
robertfrost,"Though Micah hurry, endless seems the path,"
robertfrost,And countless are the incidents beheld ;
robertfrost,His brain to trivial notice seems compelled.
robertfrost,Bronzed heads enquiring thrust out through green
robertfrost,leaves
robertfrost,"The cloak which, to be going, some one heaves"
robertfrost,"About his shoulders, while he scowls to hear ;"
robertfrost,A spade struck deep in earth stands upright near;
robertfrost,Scared women's mantles flapping down the lanes ;
robertfrost,"The brisk commotion, as when summer rains"
robertfrost,Set the farms bustling lest things hung to dry
robertfrost,"Again be wetted, so upon that cry"
robertfrost,"He saw men cross the open here and there,"
robertfrost,Not to take shelter. Matrons grave with care
robertfrost,"Haste out of doors, not for white sheets distraught ;"
robertfrost,"Lads keep pace with their elders, deep in thought;"
robertfrost,A first time summoned at the public need
robertfrost,They pay example very anxious heed.
robertfrost,"Grave for a sparkling cruelty returning,"
robertfrost,"Rapt students, they lack ears for questions wrung"
robertfrost,From girls on whose words they had often hung
robertfrost,"Whose hearts now first are for an answer yearning,"
robertfrost,"Left thus among the children dazed with tears,"
robertfrost,While baleful 'mid the leaves flash gathering spears.
robertfrost,At last was Micah thronged about with friends :
robertfrost,There in his own paved court all counsel bends
robertfrost,"Unanimous in concert with his own,"
robertfrost,"As though four hundred limbs, not his alone"
robertfrost,"Answered his instincts, prompt, imperative,"
robertfrost,"For hot pursuit. One whom a host moves with,"
robertfrost,The road glides past beneath him like a dream ;
robertfrost,At length before his eyes in harness gleam
robertfrost,"Six hundred men, and, bidden, lo, they wait :"
robertfrost,112
robertfrost,T. Sturge Moore
robertfrost,"His voice, a hundredfold its volume now,"
robertfrost,"So wields control. Majestic to dictate,"
robertfrost,"Moved forth before his friends, rebukes to bow"
robertfrost,The minds of robbers throng into his thoughts :
robertfrost,He stands to choose before their ranked cohorts.
robertfrost,"A mocking voice intrudes, "" What aileth thee ?"
robertfrost,"Why comest thou with such a company ? """
robertfrost,"Then Micah gasps : "" My gods ye have taken away,"
robertfrost,Both which I made ; the priest he too is gone ;
robertfrost,What have I more? Am I then wondered on
robertfrost,Coming amongst you ? How is it ? Ye say
robertfrost,"4 What aileth thee ? ' "" "" We, if you must know why,"
robertfrost,"Are six to one."" In feigned concern some cry,"
robertfrost,""" Let not thy voice be heard amongst us, lest"
robertfrost,"Some angry fellows run upon thee, then"
robertfrost,"Thou mightest lose thy life ; yea, thou wert best,"
robertfrost,"For sake of these thy household, with young men"
robertfrost,"To hold thy peace, since such have froward wills,"
robertfrost,"And crying oft provoketh further ills."""
robertfrost,"Micah must turn; they are too strong for him,"
robertfrost,"And, round him turning, hills, trees, neighbours swim."
robertfrost,"They led him home : he heard each kind friend's word,"
robertfrost,Yet seemed to them as though he hardly heard.
robertfrost,"The^kill was steep to climb again, and high"
robertfrost,The sun rode; earth was baked; his mouth was dry.
robertfrost,The dust in the deep ruts felt soft as mud ;
robertfrost,"A hush lay on the country; chewing cud,"
robertfrost,The cattle kept the shade ; and dotted trees
robertfrost,On distant hills did still as rocks remain ;
robertfrost,"For, void of breath and destitute of ease,"
robertfrost,No hint that God was moving gave the plain.
robertfrost,His mother came to meet him ; she was kind ;
robertfrost,His woe more than their loss distressed her mind.
robertfrost,"She led him in, spoke something, touched his sleeve ;"
robertfrost,"""3 *"
robertfrost,"7"". Sturge Moore"
robertfrost,And every act brought a minute reprieve
robertfrost,From that too present blank crushed on his sense.
robertfrost,Micah must from the poor receive an alms.
robertfrost,Ere life's jammed movements regain due suspense ;
robertfrost,What servants do helps more than costly balms.
robertfrost,To watch the swallows if the eye be caught
robertfrost,Sufficient proves to slack the bonds of thought.
robertfrost,"The rich indeed few turns of fate can bless,"
robertfrost,Yet many leave those who own much with less.
robertfrost,When put to native poverty again
robertfrost,Men hardy-to-feel-rich must pay dire toll ;
robertfrost,Their thriftless thrift results in abjedt pain.
robertfrost,Than such a man it takes a wealthier soul
robertfrost,"To count with loss. Above the Promised Land,"
robertfrost,"Though it lie distant, let but Moses stand"
robertfrost,"And see forbidden entrance, he is blest,"
robertfrost,And angels lay him quite content to rest.
robertfrost,""" Since I have seen thy face let me now die """
robertfrost,Said Israel to Joseph ; listen why.
robertfrost,""" Because thou art alive still whom I wept"
robertfrost,And mourned for dead.'' Such airy food has kept
robertfrost,The strong soul fine ; possession were too much :
robertfrost,"Since mind conceives, why should the coarse hand touch ?"
robertfrost,His gods had still less power in Micah's breast
robertfrost,"Than in the world, so on his mind scorn pressed"
robertfrost,"With ""Lords, though eyed with jasper, who are kind"
robertfrost,"And cruel fickly, might as well be blind."
robertfrost,"What, do these chaunting women gain relief,"
robertfrost,While I who wealth have lavished ache in grief !
robertfrost,"Dumb is my woe, but theirs with words is fed"
robertfrost,"Copiously gushing as for strong man dead : """
robertfrost,""" Wail, O nest of eagles young !"
robertfrost,Since those are now taken away
robertfrost,114
robertfrost,T. Sturge ZMoore
robertfrost,"Who nursed ye, on the hill-crest hung,"
robertfrost,"Cry out, bestir, and clamour with the tongue"
robertfrost,For this fair-shining is a cruel day !
robertfrost,""" How shall henceforth any know"
robertfrost,Surely of the coming rain ?
robertfrost,"When the seed 'twere best to sow,"
robertfrost,Now or not yet ? What will show ?
robertfrost,Things when lost must aye remain
robertfrost,In the corner where they rolled
robertfrost,Even should they be of gold.
robertfrost,"Ailing babes will wail in vain,"
robertfrost,"Will pine, will perish ; watched, not helped in pain."
robertfrost,""" Weep, for the Ephod is gone !"
robertfrost,To us it no more will give
robertfrost,Urim nor Thummim ; but on
robertfrost,Our eyes night drops; we live
robertfrost,"Henceforth as the blind, we cry"
robertfrost,Like little foxes from holes
robertfrost,When their mother is fast in the snare
robertfrost,We cry but what help is there ?
robertfrost,Great silence overwhelms our souls.
robertfrost,""" Man's words in this strange world no more avail"
robertfrost,Than in our midst the new-born child's sad wail.
robertfrost,Thus ringed by elder natures must we weep ;
robertfrost,"Though Thunder speak, the thought is passing deep."
robertfrost,And who can read the faces of the clouds
robertfrost,Or penetrate the mystery that shrouds
robertfrost,The placid smiling of the sky ?
robertfrost,Then lift ye up the voice and cry !
robertfrost,Our Gods perchance may hear
robertfrost,They yet are somewhat near.
robertfrost,T. Sturge Moore
robertfrost,For if they turn not back ye are forlorn ;
robertfrost,Midnight is silent and the Noon ;
robertfrost,Who shall whisper with the Morn?
robertfrost,With the Evening who commune?
robertfrost,These counsel with themselves alone
robertfrost,To no man is their favour shown.
robertfrost,"Then cry aloud, be urgent in your wail ;"
robertfrost,"When all else fails, persistence may avail."""
robertfrost,All round him rose a coolness of stone walls ;
robertfrost,Translucent vine-leaves softly laced the glare
robertfrost,Which else had trespassed through the portal deep.
robertfrost,Along the walls stood vintage of old years
robertfrost,"In massive jars high as a woman's chin,"
robertfrost,A thick dust mantling each round-shouldered well.
robertfrost,"Bundles of herbs, baskets and pruning hooks,"
robertfrost,"Hung from the cedarn rafters, vague in gloom ;"
robertfrost,And on the smooth-planed table there was fruit
robertfrost,"Damsons and pears, while, from its trencher, sliced"
robertfrost,"A crusted melon, luscious womb of seeds,"
robertfrost,"Glowed and shed fragrance. Audible, since they"
robertfrost,"Have ceased to sing, the gurgling spring tunes time,"
robertfrost,"And keeps in mind the cavernous cool rocks,"
robertfrost,"Umbrageous trees, and many a hazy glimpse"
robertfrost,"Across the basking plains, whereto his vines"
robertfrost,Slope with their mellow ranks of rustling leaves.
robertfrost,But 'mid the little chapel's hollow walls
robertfrost,Now dwells an aching absence where his gods
robertfrost,"Had stood in glimmering splendour to protect,"
robertfrost,For ever smiling on a pile of gifts
robertfrost,"Crisp flowery loaves and golden maize and doves,"
robertfrost,"Grey doves with yellow plumage round their necks,"
robertfrost,"With ribbed feet tied, drooped wings and blue veiled"
robertfrost,eyes.
robertfrost,116
robertfrost,T. Sturge ^Moore
robertfrost,"No more will some two hundred kneel for awe,"
robertfrost,"No shout of praise start every rock to tell,"
robertfrost,"And loudly tell, Jehovah's glorious name ;"
robertfrost,"Nor will he joy in prestige erewhile his,"
robertfrost,A rich and envied god-possessing man.
robertfrost,"Beyond his fathers wise, he had had suck"
robertfrost,"Of all the abundance which in seas is found,"
robertfrost,And of the treasures hidden in the sand.
robertfrost,"Close speech with swarthy captains had he held,"
robertfrost,And placed much confidence in ships ; yet kept
robertfrost,"Well-watered vineyards, sounding fields of corn."
robertfrost,His beard was black ; still hale and firm his limbs ;
robertfrost,The fuller's finest white with scarlet fringe
robertfrost,"He wore, and it became him ; chains of gold"
robertfrost,At feast and wedding jangled on his breast;
robertfrost,Damsels still met him blushing younger men
robertfrost,Passed for less handsome. What harsh climax now
robertfrost,"Crowned his content ? the gratitude of Gods,"
robertfrost,"Whose images, made from his mother's gold,"
robertfrost,"He honoured, and was honoured in return,"
robertfrost,"Till now, he thought. Yet still the thunder failed"
robertfrost,To bring their state home ; wrathful agencies
robertfrost,"Muttered not, mustering round the massive forms"
robertfrost,Of Ebal and of Gerizim. His wife
robertfrost,And mother only dream of succour now.
robertfrost,"Yes, they are cooking : from the further room"
robertfrost,"Come and return ; they sigh, but taste the broth,"
robertfrost,And know how much salt lacks. Trivial concern
robertfrost,"Divides their hearts with woe : life's menials they,"
robertfrost,Incapable of concentrated aim.
robertfrost,They grudge to risk their wealth on Tyrian trade ;
robertfrost,"And when they see it doubled, ""Praise the Lord! """
robertfrost,"Appropriate seems to them. But men face risk,"
robertfrost,117
robertfrost,T. Sturge ZMoore
robertfrost,Can calculate and gain ; therefore to them
robertfrost,Loss is calamity; girls buoyed on chance
robertfrost,"Have not the strength to feel. And yet he went,"
robertfrost,When told the supper waited him above.
robertfrost,The roof of that tall house lightly was raised
robertfrost,On slender colonnettes set nigh as close
robertfrost,As palings : Micah through their intervals
robertfrost,Had oft at leisure from his couch surveyed
robertfrost,The plain stretched round him ; slingers in the corn ;
robertfrost,The wine-press whither they bring in his grapes :
robertfrost,"Unmuzzled and well-fed, slow oxen trod"
robertfrost,The terrace threshing-floor. His children near
robertfrost,Played on all fours ; his wife would bend her down
robertfrost,"To kiss him, having crooned some song he loved."
robertfrost,And still to-day his eyes are fond enough
robertfrost,"To rest upon the hills, to weigh the worth"
robertfrost,"Of this year's vintage, watch the labourers' heads"
robertfrost,Appear and disappear beyond the brink
robertfrost,Of his new vat : languidly stray his eyes ;
robertfrost,Anon he finds them choosing from the meats.
robertfrost,His palate next approves : his lips return
robertfrost,His mother's smile. Yet is his good soul hurt
robertfrost,At every acquiescence : yet less hurt
robertfrost,"Each time ; and so he slips into fond ease,"
robertfrost,"Half conscious of some failure, discontent"
robertfrost,"To be content. The long day closes in,"
robertfrost,And on the cooing dove-cot comes a lull ;
robertfrost,The night wind whispers o'er the corn ; the pipe
robertfrost,Of some boy goat-herd reedlike from the cliffs
robertfrost,Trembles and dies away. He seeks his bed.
robertfrost,And as a girl who quits her home to serve
robertfrost,"In some rich house, and wear far gayer clothes,"
robertfrost,"(Dance, song, and work with beads, henceforth her tasks)"
robertfrost,118
robertfrost,T. Sturge Moore
robertfrost,Heart-broken feels when first she hears that news ;
robertfrost,Yet presently the talk and bustle scare
robertfrost,Her sorrow till she smiling takes her leave:
robertfrost,"So Micah, quit of all deep feeling, smiled ;"
robertfrost,"And, to the sound of water gurgling o'er"
robertfrost,"Its vaulted rocky well, entered on realms"
robertfrost,Of slumber soother than the world. But as
robertfrost,Mid those less strenuous days a sense of loss
robertfrost,"Returns upon that girl, bewild'ring, fraught"
robertfrost,"With blunt remorse, indefinite rebuke,"
robertfrost,"And makes her sob in bed at night, so now"
robertfrost,"Into his first light sleep, disquiet crept :"
robertfrost,"As when the night wind comes across the sea,"
robertfrost,Sweeps through the halls and markets and dense streets
robertfrost,"That crowd a haven, steady and cold and salt :"
robertfrost,"Drives forth foul odours, penetrates dark dens,"
robertfrost,"To wearied slaves brings sleep, to fevered death :"
robertfrost,Shakes the low tavern door ends the carouse
robertfrost,"Of drunken sailors, blowing out their lamp,"
robertfrost,And moaning with the voice of comrades drowned :
robertfrost,So now through Micah's brain discomfort came.
robertfrost,"Salt as with tears and set one way like wind,"
robertfrost,"Drove through him, roused compunction for the pain"
robertfrost,"Deserted with such ease, jostled bland dreams"
robertfrost,As serried soldiers elbow through the throngs
robertfrost,Of chatty market folk ; and no man knows
robertfrost,"Aught of their orders, though all dread to learn"
robertfrost,Whether some heavier tax be levied now
robertfrost,Corvee exacted on some boast in stone
robertfrost,Or whether their king's mind has taken late
robertfrost,"A sanguinary ply, because in sleep"
robertfrost,He hears a long blade on a smooth wet stone
robertfrost,Pass and re-pass ; and then a silence falls
robertfrost,"As though who whets it, curious of the edge,"
robertfrost,119
robertfrost,T. Sturge ZMoore
robertfrost,Slipped it along his thumb and smiled but soon
robertfrost,Recurs the regular lisp 'twixt steel and stone.
robertfrost,Loud Micah's heart beat as men's then will beat
robertfrost,Guessed at a wrath no more to be forestalled
robertfrost,Than such a fear-besotted tyrant's rage
robertfrost,Stopped dead as their hearts stop when all at once
robertfrost,The trumpets snarl ear-splitting o'er the booths.
robertfrost,It was as though a thunder pealed him words :
robertfrost,""" Shall gods depart, yet be so briefly mourned? """
robertfrost,"Then, compassed round with cloud, the cherubim"
robertfrost,"Bowed with the heavens and came down, while he"
robertfrost,"Cowered and kept his face pressed on the dust,"
robertfrost,Expecting death : but ah ! they turned their wheels
robertfrost,"Which did not crunch across his abject corse,"
robertfrost,"Yet rumbled near, continuing less loud"
robertfrost,Until they passed from ear-shot. Long he ached
robertfrost,In pulseless silence and black void.
robertfrost,A child
robertfrost,"Abandoned in the dark begins to wail,"
robertfrost,"Then, panic-goaded, daring never stop,"
robertfrost,"In one continuous scream throws back its head,"
robertfrost,"And seeks to drive life's self forth with the sound,"
robertfrost,"Till suffocated, stunned, faint, it must lie"
robertfrost,"And cough. So Micah dreamed he did, and heard"
robertfrost,After interminable flagging throbs
robertfrost,His mother move from near him with a lamp
robertfrost,"And say: ""He sleeps again,"" pause and then add"
robertfrost,""" He breatheth quietly; come, leave him now! """
robertfrost,"Hot with strange shame, grown man with child confused,"
robertfrost,Some time elapsed ere he became aware
robertfrost,"That, round the chamber where his bed was set,"
robertfrost,Rain made such sound as when it long hath rained.

robertfrost,Tashoda. It was those wicked cowherd boys: they've

robertfrost,Tashoda. Vishnu ! To him how oft have I not prayed ?
robertfrost,"But who knows when the Gods have heard ? 'Tis said,"
robertfrost,"Ofttimes like men they sleep, or sit and watch"

robertfrost,The sighs of us poor mortals ? And they tell
robertfrost,How from their heavens the Gods descend and dwell
robertfrost,Within the bodies of wild beasts and men.
robertfrost,Can they have ears to listen to us then?
robertfrost,Those boys spoke true : rny son has magic arts ;
robertfrost,Or why should he have such power over all hearts ?
robertfrost,"I sometimes think, so different he seems"
robertfrost,"From all else, that a God's soul, in its dreams,"
robertfrost,"Oft enters him, and lodges there awhile."
robertfrost,Did not sage Rishis journey mile on mile
robertfrost,"To behold him in his cradle, and bow low"

robertfrost,"Ah but then most beautiful is my Radha,"
robertfrost,When her scornfully flashing eyes

robertfrost,"In secret working unconfessed,"
robertfrost,"Hope and wistful fear and yearning pain,"
robertfrost,"Innocent tenderness, reluctant"

robertfrost,[He now notices the RISHI.
robertfrost,What is this ? Who is here ?
robertfrost,Some saintly Rishi lapsed in trance. More still
robertfrost,"He seems than a deserted ant-hill, and"
robertfrost,As void perchance of any thought or joy.
robertfrost,Vishnu preserve me from such torpid saintliness !
robertfrost,Yet have I heard men say that when the mind
robertfrost,"And bodily senses sleep, the wakeful soul"
robertfrost,Delightedly goes forth and wandering sees
robertfrost,"Visions divine and glorious, unbeheld"

robertfrost,And bathe his parching spirit a brief while
robertfrost,In rivers of living joy?
robertfrost,\He flays a melody on his flute. T'he music

robertfrost,"KRISHNA stops playing; and the RISHI,"
robertfrost,"who, though now fully awake ^ does not see"

robertfrost,Rishi. Vishnu ! Almighty Vishnu !
robertfrost,To thee be praise !

robertfrost,Yet at first I saw there
robertfrost,Gloom only and despair;

robertfrost,""" Where is our Vishnu, where ? """
robertfrost,And at that word
robertfrost,"I saw Gods shudder and turn pale,"
robertfrost,130

robertfrost,And heard the Apsaras and Ghandavas wail:
robertfrost,"The Heavens grew dark, and all awhile sat mute :"
robertfrost,When from afar was heard
robertfrost,"The faint note of a flute,"
robertfrost,"More near, more near, till in the midst there stood"
robertfrost,"A youth, a shepherd boy, who played"
robertfrost,Such melodies on his flute as made
robertfrost,"The eyes of Gods grow dim,"
robertfrost,And their hearts marvellously set free
robertfrost,To wander forth delightedly
robertfrost,"From their grief-gloomed selves to him,"
robertfrost,Where his slender limbs to the music swayed.
robertfrost,Listening and beholding then
robertfrost,"All knew him, the beloved, the adored"
robertfrost,"Of Gods and mortal men,"
robertfrost,"Their Vishnu, to their sight restored."
robertfrost,"But the flute ceased, and a change came,'"
robertfrost,And the dream of bliss was ended :
robertfrost,"For the light of Heaven darkened,"
robertfrost,As away the vision faded.

robertfrost,That you should take me for a God to worship?

robertfrost,Tashoda. How faint he looks. He seems in pain.
robertfrost,"Quick, tell me what you want, poor child."
robertfrost,"Krishna. A small thing, mother darling."
robertfrost,Just one small pearl from your neck-chain.
robertfrost,"You soon shall have it back again,"
robertfrost,"And new ones too, I promise."
robertfrost,Tashoda. Is that all? There! Take which you will
robertfrost,Since pining for it has made you ill.
robertfrost,Though I don't quite see why that should be.
robertfrost,"Krishna. Now you shall see why, mother."
robertfrost,Boys. What will he do with it? Now shall we know
robertfrost,whether Krishna
robertfrost,"Merely was boasting at random, or meant it in earnest,"
robertfrost,When from a pearl he professed he could raise up a
robertfrost,pearl- tree.
robertfrost,"Thoughtfully, see, in the palm of his hand he inspects it."
robertfrost,"Doubting he stands in a quandary. O silly Krishna,"
robertfrost,Are you a God or a Rishi to work such a wonder ?
robertfrost,"Nay, but have patience awhile."
robertfrost,"See, with a confident smile"
robertfrost,"How he dibbles the soil with his wand, and with heed"
robertfrost,Plants in the hole his miraculous seed !
robertfrost,Yashoda. Krishna ! Krishna ! What have you done !
robertfrost,Have you buried my pearl ? So you meant to make fun
robertfrost,Of your poor old mother before this crew
robertfrost,Of rascally boys ? Oh shame on you !
robertfrost,"Boys. Mother Yashoda, now dont be a scold."
robertfrost,"See, he has covered it up with mould !"
robertfrost,With a smile he turns away.

robertfrost,Subala. What 's so wonderful in this tree?
robertfrost,Wait until he can show us a pearl
robertfrost,Hanging upon a pearl-tree bough.
robertfrost,Sudama. Already it 's grown seven inches tall.
robertfrost,"Valarama. No, ten."
robertfrost,"Another Boy. Why, surely it 's over a foot."
robertfrost,"Subala. What if it 's no real tree atall,"
robertfrost,"But a false delusion, a cheating charm"
robertfrost,Cast over our minds by Krishna's flute ?
robertfrost,"Sudama. No, for I've touched it. You too try."
robertfrost,It 's just as real as you or I.
robertfrost,"Another Boy. I've measured it : see, it 's as long as my"

robertfrost,Sudama. Wider and thicker and higher and quicker
robertfrost,"It 's spreading and curling, expanding, unfurling."
robertfrost,Subala. But I dont see it pearling.
robertfrost,"Another Boy. What is that? Do you see? Oh, what"

robertfrost,"Tashoda. O Krishna, my joy !"
robertfrost,Krishna. There are some for your ear ;
robertfrost,And there 's a good handful to make a new chain.
robertfrost,"Boys. Come, let us pick them and prick them and thread"
robertfrost,"them on twine,"
robertfrost,And make of them chains to engarland the necks of our

robertfrost,"AH, had you but been there to see !"
robertfrost,"Radha. Yes, then"
robertfrost,I might have known the truth.
robertfrost,Lalita. Why should you doubt me ?
robertfrost,"Radha. Give me some proof, instead of all these words."
robertfrost,You talk of pearls in myriads ; yet not one
robertfrost,Have you brought back to show me.
robertfrost,"Lalita. How could I, Radha ?"
robertfrost,Did you not bid me keep myself close hidden ?
robertfrost,"Radha. Well, then?"
robertfrost,"Lalita. Why, then I rose and stole away :"
robertfrost,But as I looked back through the leaves I saw
robertfrost,That now from a bush it had become a tree

robertfrost,Piercing and threading them . . .
robertfrost,Radha. Piercing indeed!
robertfrost,"These pearls of yours must have been strange ones, soft"
robertfrost,As grapes or rose-buds to be pierced so easily.
robertfrost,"Lalita. Which would you deem the greater miracle,"
robertfrost,"From a pearl to raise a pearl-tree, or to give power"
robertfrost,To pierce with needles his own magic fruit?
robertfrost,Radha. Needles ! Whence had these cowherds needles?
robertfrost,Did
robertfrost,The pearl-tree bear them too ?
robertfrost,"Lalita. No, 'twas Yashoda."
robertfrost,She found them needles. And all the while aloof
robertfrost,"Stood Krishna, unconcerned, heedless of all"
robertfrost,Save his flute's melody ; while the enchanted herd
robertfrost,"Thronged round him gazing, and forgot 'to feed."
robertfrost,"Radha. Oh, I am out of patience with your mockery."
robertfrost,"Lalita. Radha, believe me, I have told you truth,"
robertfrost,"As an hour hence you'll know, when they come leading"
robertfrost,"Their cattle home, crowned and festooned with pearls,"
robertfrost,Their own necks too like rajahs garlanded.
robertfrost,What then will pride avail you against their ribaldries
robertfrost,And Krishna's vengeful triumph and disdain ?
robertfrost,"What, save to augment grief's shame? Be wise, and"
robertfrost,seek
robertfrost,"That pardon, which he waits for but one word"

robertfrost,"Tell me, I pray, was Krishna here but now?"
robertfrost,Rishi. Who art thou ?
robertfrost,"Radha. I am Radha. I seek Krishna,"

robertfrost,"Rishi. Him whom men call Krishna I have seen,"
robertfrost,And I have heard his flute.
robertfrost,Radha. But why has vanished
robertfrost,His pearl-sown tree ? Was it not here it grew ?
robertfrost,Rishi. Canst thou not see it?
robertfrost,Radha. No ; I see nothing here.
robertfrost,Rishi. The proud in heart see nought. Pride blinds
robertfrost,their eyes.
robertfrost,"Radha. Oh, I am proud no more : yet am I blind."
robertfrost,"Rishi. Then thou shalt see perchance, when 'tis his will."
robertfrost,"Radha. Alas, weak is my faith : but I repent"

robertfrost,How may I find my Krishna ?
robertfrost,Rishi. When so he wills.
robertfrost,"Radha. Ay me! I have scorned, faithlessly scorned"
