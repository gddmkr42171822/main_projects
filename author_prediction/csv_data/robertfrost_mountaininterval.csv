robertfrost,_THE ROAD NOT TAKEN_
robertfrost,"_Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,"
robertfrost,And sorry I could not travel both
robertfrost,"And be one traveler, long I stood"
robertfrost,And looked down one as far as I could
robertfrost,To where it bent in the undergrowth;_
robertfrost,"_Then took the other, as just as fair,"
robertfrost,"And having perhaps the better claim,"
robertfrost,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
robertfrost,Though as for that the passing there
robertfrost,"Had worn them really about the same,_"
robertfrost,_And both that morning equally lay
robertfrost,In leaves no step had trodden black.
robertfrost,"Oh, I kept the first for another day!"
robertfrost,"Yet knowing how way leads on to way,"
robertfrost,I doubted if I should ever come back._
robertfrost,_I shall be telling this with a sigh
robertfrost,Somewhere ages and ages hence:
robertfrost,"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--"
robertfrost,"I took the one less traveled by,"
robertfrost,And that has made all the difference._
robertfrost,CHRISTMAS TREES
robertfrost,(_A Christmas Circular Letter_)
robertfrost,The city had withdrawn into itself
robertfrost,And left at last the country to the country;
robertfrost,When between whirls of snow not come to lie
robertfrost,"And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove"
robertfrost,"A stranger to our yard, who looked the city,"
robertfrost,Yet did in country fashion in that there
robertfrost,He sat and waited till he drew us out
robertfrost,A-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.
robertfrost,He proved to be the city come again
robertfrost,To look for something it had left behind
robertfrost,And could not do without and keep its Christmas.
robertfrost,He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;
robertfrost,My woods--the young fir balsams like a place
robertfrost,Where houses all are churches and have spires.
robertfrost,I hadn't thought of them as Christmas Trees.
robertfrost,I doubt if I was tempted for a moment
robertfrost,To sell them off their feet to go in cars
robertfrost,"And leave the slope behind the house all bare,"
robertfrost,Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.
robertfrost,I'd hate to have them know it if I was.
robertfrost,Yet more I'd hate to hold my trees except
robertfrost,"As others hold theirs or refuse for them,"
robertfrost,"Beyond the time of profitable growth,"
robertfrost,The trial by market everything must come to.
robertfrost,I dallied so much with the thought of selling.
robertfrost,Then whether from mistaken courtesy
robertfrost,"And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether"
robertfrost,"From hope of hearing good of what was mine,"
robertfrost,"I said, ""There aren't enough to be worth while."""
robertfrost,"""I could soon tell how many they would cut,"
robertfrost,"You let me look them over."""
robertfrost,"""You could look."
robertfrost,"But don't expect I'm going to let you have them."""
robertfrost,"Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close"
robertfrost,"That lop each other of boughs, but not a few"
robertfrost,Quite solitary and having equal boughs
robertfrost,"All round and round. The latter he nodded ""Yes"" to,"
robertfrost,"Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one,"
robertfrost,"With a buyer's moderation, ""That would do."""
robertfrost,"I thought so too, but wasn't there to say so."
robertfrost,"We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,"
robertfrost,And came down on the north.
robertfrost,"He said, ""A thousand."""
robertfrost,"""A thousand Christmas trees!--at what apiece?"""
robertfrost,He felt some need of softening that to me:
robertfrost,"""A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars."""
robertfrost,Then I was certain I had never meant
robertfrost,To let him have them. Never show surprise!
robertfrost,But thirty dollars seemed so small beside
robertfrost,"The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents"
robertfrost,"(For that was all they figured out apiece),"
robertfrost,Three cents so small beside the dollar friends
robertfrost,I should be writing to within the hour
robertfrost,"Would pay in cities for good trees like those,"
robertfrost,Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools
robertfrost,Could hang enough on to pick off enough.
robertfrost,A thousand Christmas trees I didn't know I had!
robertfrost,"Worth three cents more to give away than sell,"
robertfrost,As may be shown by a simple calculation.
robertfrost,Too bad I couldn't lay one in a letter.
robertfrost,"I can't help wishing I could send you one,"
robertfrost,In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.
robertfrost,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT
robertfrost,All out of doors looked darkly in at him
robertfrost,"Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,"
robertfrost,That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.
robertfrost,What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
robertfrost,Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.
robertfrost,What kept him from remembering what it was
robertfrost,That brought him to that creaking room was age.
robertfrost,He stood with barrels round him--at a loss.
robertfrost,And having scared the cellar under him
robertfrost,"In clomping there, he scared it once again"
robertfrost,"In clomping off;--and scared the outer night,"
robertfrost,"Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar"
robertfrost,"Of trees and crack of branches, common things,"
robertfrost,But nothing so like beating on a box.
robertfrost,A light he was to no one but himself
robertfrost,"Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,"
robertfrost,"A quiet light, and then not even that."
robertfrost,"He consigned to the moon, such as she was,"
robertfrost,"So late-arising, to the broken moon"
robertfrost,As better than the sun in any case
robertfrost,"For such a charge, his snow upon the roof,"
robertfrost,His icicles along the wall to keep;
robertfrost,And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt
robertfrost,"Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,"
robertfrost,"And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept."
robertfrost,"One aged man--one man--can't fill a house,"
robertfrost,"A farm, a countryside, or if he can,"
robertfrost,It's thus he does it of a winter night.
robertfrost,A PATCH OF OLD SNOW
robertfrost,There's a patch of old snow in a corner
robertfrost,That I should have guessed
robertfrost,Was a blow-away paper the rain
robertfrost,Had brought to rest.
robertfrost,It is speckled with grime as if
robertfrost,"Small print overspread it,"
robertfrost,The news of a day I've forgotten--
robertfrost,If I ever read it.
robertfrost,IN THE HOME STRETCH
robertfrost,"She stood against the kitchen sink, and looked"
robertfrost,Over the sink out through a dusty window
robertfrost,At weeds the water from the sink made tall.
robertfrost,She wore her cape; her hat was in her hand.
robertfrost,"Behind her was confusion in the room,"
robertfrost,Of chairs turned upside down to sit like people
robertfrost,"In other chairs, and something, come to look,"
robertfrost,"For every room a house has--parlor, bed-room,"
robertfrost,And dining-room--thrown pell-mell in the kitchen.
robertfrost,"And now and then a smudged, infernal face"
robertfrost,Looked in a door behind her and addressed
robertfrost,Her back. She always answered without turning.
robertfrost,"""Where will I put this walnut bureau, lady?"""
robertfrost,"""Put it on top of something that's on top"
robertfrost,"Of something else,"" she laughed. ""Oh, put it where"
robertfrost,"You can to-night, and go. It's almost dark;"
robertfrost,"You must be getting started back to town."""
robertfrost,Another blackened face thrust in and looked
robertfrost,"And smiled, and when she did not turn, spoke gently,"
robertfrost,"""What are you seeing out the window, _lady_?"""
robertfrost,"""Never was I beladied so before."
robertfrost,Would evidence of having been called lady
robertfrost,More than so many times make me a lady
robertfrost,"In common law, I wonder."""
robertfrost,"""But I ask,"
robertfrost,"What are you seeing out the window, lady?"""
robertfrost,"""What I'll be seeing more of in the years"
robertfrost,To come as here I stand and go the round
robertfrost,"Of many plates with towels many times."""
robertfrost,"""And what is that? You only put me off."""
robertfrost,"""Rank weeds that love the water from the dish-pan"
robertfrost,"More than some women like the dish-pan, Joe;"
robertfrost,A little stretch of mowing-field for you;
robertfrost,Not much of that until I come to woods
robertfrost,That end all. And it's scarce enough to call
robertfrost,"A view."""
robertfrost,"""And yet you think you like it, dear?"""
robertfrost,"""That's what you're so concerned to know! You hope"
robertfrost,I like it. Bang goes something big away
robertfrost,Off there upstairs. The very tread of men
robertfrost,As great as those is shattering to the frame
robertfrost,"Of such a little house. Once left alone,"
robertfrost,"You and I, dear, will go with softer steps"
robertfrost,"Up and down stairs and through the rooms, and none"
robertfrost,But sudden winds that snatch them from our hands
robertfrost,"Will ever slam the doors."""
robertfrost,"""I think you see"
robertfrost,"More than you like to own to out that window."""
robertfrost,"""No; for besides the things I tell you of,"
robertfrost,I only see the years. They come and go
robertfrost,"In alternation with the weeds, the field,"
robertfrost,"The wood."""
robertfrost,"""What kind of years?"""
robertfrost,"""Why, latter years--"
robertfrost,"Different from early years."""
robertfrost,"""I see them, too."
robertfrost,"You didn't count them?"""
robertfrost,"""No, the further off"
robertfrost,So ran together that I didn't try to.
robertfrost,It can scarce be that they would be in number
robertfrost,"We'd care to know, for we are not young now."
robertfrost,And bang goes something else away off there.
robertfrost,"It sounds as if it were the men went down,"
robertfrost,And every crash meant one less to return
robertfrost,"To lighted city streets we, too, have known,"
robertfrost,"But now are giving up for country darkness."""
robertfrost,"""Come from that window where you see too much for me,"
robertfrost,And take a livelier view of things from here.
robertfrost,They're going. Watch this husky swarming up
robertfrost,"Over the wheel into the sky-high seat,"
robertfrost,"Lighting his pipe now, squinting down his nose"
robertfrost,"At the flame burning downward as he sucks it."""
robertfrost,"""See how it makes his nose-side bright, a proof"
robertfrost,How dark it's getting. Can you tell what time
robertfrost,It is by that? Or by the moon? The new moon!
robertfrost,What shoulder did I see her over? Neither.
robertfrost,"A wire she is of silver, as new as we"
robertfrost,To everything. Her light won't last us long.
robertfrost,"It's something, though, to know we're going to have her"
robertfrost,Night after night and stronger every night
robertfrost,"To see us through our first two weeks. But, Joe,"
robertfrost,The stove! Before they go! Knock on the window;
robertfrost,Ask them to help you get it on its feet.
robertfrost,"We stand here dreaming. Hurry! Call them back!"""
robertfrost,"""They're not gone yet."""
robertfrost,"""We've got to have the stove,"
robertfrost,Whatever else we want for. And a light.
robertfrost,Have we a piece of candle if the lamp
robertfrost,"And oil are buried out of reach?"""
robertfrost,Again
robertfrost,"The house was full of tramping, and the dark,"
robertfrost,Door-filling men burst in and seized the stove.
robertfrost,"A cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall,"
robertfrost,To which they set it true by eye; and then
robertfrost,"Came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands,"
robertfrost,So much too light and airy for their strength
robertfrost,"It almost seemed to come ballooning up,"
robertfrost,Slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling.
robertfrost,"""A fit!"" said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder."
robertfrost,"""It's good luck when you move in to begin"
robertfrost,"With good luck with your stovepipe. Never mind,"
robertfrost,"It's not so bad in the country, settled down,"
robertfrost,"When people're getting on in life. You'll like it."""
robertfrost,"Joe said: ""You big boys ought to find a farm,"
robertfrost,"And make good farmers, and leave other fellows"
robertfrost,The city work to do. There's not enough
robertfrost,"For everybody as it is in there."""
robertfrost,"""God!"" one said wildly, and, when no one spoke:"
robertfrost,"""Say that to Jimmy here. He needs a farm."""
robertfrost,But Jimmy only made his jaw recede
robertfrost,"Fool-like, and rolled his eyes as if to say"
robertfrost,He saw himself a farmer. Then there was a French boy
robertfrost,"Who said with seriousness that made them laugh,"
robertfrost,"""Ma friend, you ain't know what it is you're ask."""
robertfrost,He doffed his cap and held it with both hands
robertfrost,Across his chest to make as 'twere a bow:
robertfrost,"""We're giving you our chances on de farm."""
robertfrost,And then they all turned to with deafening boots
robertfrost,And put each other bodily out of the house.
robertfrost,"""Goodby to them! We puzzle them. They think--"
robertfrost,I don't know what they think we see in what
robertfrost,They leave us to: that pasture slope that seems
robertfrost,The back some farm presents us; and your woods
robertfrost,"To northward from your window at the sink,"
robertfrost,Waiting to steal a step on us whenever
robertfrost,"We drop our eyes or turn to other things,"
robertfrost,"As in the game 'Ten-step' the children play."""
robertfrost,"""Good boys they seemed, and let them love the city."
robertfrost,All they could say was 'God!' when you proposed
robertfrost,"Their coming out and making useful farmers."""
robertfrost,"""Did they make something lonesome go through you?"
robertfrost,It would take more than them to sicken you--
robertfrost,Us of our bargain. But they left us so
robertfrost,"As to our fate, like fools past reasoning with."
robertfrost,"They almost shook _me_."""
robertfrost,"""It's all so much"
robertfrost,"What we have always wanted, I confess"
robertfrost,It's seeming bad for a moment makes it seem
robertfrost,"Even worse still, and so on down, down, down."
robertfrost,It's nothing; it's their leaving us at dusk.
robertfrost,I never bore it well when people went.
robertfrost,"The first night after guests have gone, the house"
robertfrost,Seems haunted or exposed. I always take
robertfrost,A personal interest in the locking up
robertfrost,"At bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off."""
robertfrost,He fetched a dingy lantern from behind
robertfrost,"A door. ""There's that we didn't lose! And these!""--"
robertfrost,"Some matches he unpocketed. ""For food--"
robertfrost,The meals we've had no one can take from us.
robertfrost,I wish that everything on earth were just
robertfrost,As certain as the meals we've had. I wish
robertfrost,"The meals we haven't had were, anyway."
robertfrost,"What have you you know where to lay your hands on?"""
robertfrost,"""The bread we bought in passing at the store."
robertfrost,"There's butter somewhere, too."""
robertfrost,"""Let's rend the bread."
robertfrost,I'll light the fire for company for you;
robertfrost,You'll not have any other company
robertfrost,Till Ed begins to get out on a Sunday
robertfrost,To look us over and give us his idea
robertfrost,"Of what wants pruning, shingling, breaking up."
robertfrost,"He'll know what he would do if he were we,"
robertfrost,And all at once. He'll plan for us and plan
robertfrost,"To help us, but he'll take it out in planning."
robertfrost,"Well, you can set the table with the loaf."
robertfrost,Let's see you find your loaf. I'll light the fire.
robertfrost,I like chairs occupying other chairs
robertfrost,"Not offering a lady--"""
robertfrost,"""There again, Joe!"
robertfrost,"_You're tired._"""
robertfrost,"""I'm drunk-nonsensical tired out;"
robertfrost,Don't mind a word I say. It's a day's work
robertfrost,To empty one house of all household goods
robertfrost,"And fill another with 'em fifteen miles away,"
robertfrost,"Although you do no more than dump them down."""
robertfrost,"""Dumped down in paradise we are and happy."""
robertfrost,"""It's all so much what I have always wanted,"
robertfrost,"I can't believe it's what you wanted, too."""
robertfrost,"""Shouldn't you like to know?"""
robertfrost,"""I'd like to know"
robertfrost,"If it is what you wanted, then how much"
robertfrost,"You wanted it for me."""
robertfrost,"""A troubled conscience!"
robertfrost,"You don't want me to tell if _I_ don't know."""
robertfrost,"""I don't want to find out what can't be known."
robertfrost,"But who first said the word to come?"""
robertfrost,"""My dear,"
robertfrost,"It's who first thought the thought. You're searching, Joe,"
robertfrost,For things that don't exist; I mean beginnings.
robertfrost,Ends and beginnings--there are no such things.
robertfrost,"There are only middles."""
robertfrost,"""What is this?"""
robertfrost,"""This life?"
robertfrost,Our sitting here by lantern-light together
robertfrost,Amid the wreckage of a former home?
robertfrost,You won't deny the lantern isn't new.
robertfrost,"The stove is not, and you are not to me,"
robertfrost,"Nor I to you."""
robertfrost,"""Perhaps you never were?"""
robertfrost,"""It would take me forever to recite"
robertfrost,All that's not new in where we find ourselves.
robertfrost,New is a word for fools in towns who think
robertfrost,Style upon style in dress and thought at last
robertfrost,Must get somewhere. I've heard you say as much.
robertfrost,"No, this is no beginning."""
robertfrost,"""Then an end?"""
robertfrost,"""End is a gloomy word."""
robertfrost,"""Is it too late"
robertfrost,To drag you out for just a good-night call
robertfrost,On the old peach trees on the knoll to grope
robertfrost,By starlight in the grass for a last peach
robertfrost,The neighbors may not have taken as their right
robertfrost,When the house wasn't lived in? I've been looking:
robertfrost,I doubt if they have left us many grapes.
robertfrost,"Before we set ourselves to right the house,"
robertfrost,"The first thing in the morning, out we go"
robertfrost,"To go the round of apple, cherry, peach,"
robertfrost,"Pine, alder, pasture, mowing, well, and brook."
robertfrost,"All of a farm it is."""
robertfrost,"""I know this much:"
robertfrost,"I'm going to put you in your bed, if first"
robertfrost,"I have to make you build it. Come, the light."""
robertfrost,"When there was no more lantern in the kitchen,"
robertfrost,The fire got out through crannies in the stove
robertfrost,"And danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling,"
robertfrost,As much at home as if they'd always danced there.
robertfrost,THE TELEPHONE
robertfrost,"""When I was just as far as I could walk"
robertfrost,"From here to-day,"
robertfrost,There was an hour
robertfrost,All still
robertfrost,When leaning with my head against a flower
robertfrost,I heard you talk.
robertfrost,"Don't say I didn't, for I heard you say--"
robertfrost,You spoke from that flower on the window sill--
robertfrost,"Do you remember what it was you said?"""
robertfrost,"""First tell me what it was you thought you heard."""
robertfrost,"""Having found the flower and driven a bee away,"
robertfrost,"I leaned my head,"
robertfrost,"And holding by the stalk,"
robertfrost,I listened and I thought I caught the word--
robertfrost,What was it? Did you call me by my name?
robertfrost,Or did you say--
robertfrost,"_Someone_ said 'Come'--I heard it as I bowed."""
robertfrost,"""I may have thought as much, but not aloud."""
robertfrost,"""Well, so I came."""
robertfrost,MEETING AND PASSING
robertfrost,As I went down the hill along the wall
robertfrost,There was a gate I had leaned at for the view
robertfrost,And had just turned from when I first saw you
robertfrost,As you came up the hill. We met. But all
robertfrost,We did that day was mingle great and small
robertfrost,Footprints in summer dust as if we drew
robertfrost,The figure of our being less than two
robertfrost,But more than one as yet. Your parasol
robertfrost,Pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust.
robertfrost,And all the time we talked you seemed to see
robertfrost,Something down there to smile at in the dust.
robertfrost,"(Oh, it was without prejudice to me!)"
robertfrost,Afterward I went past what you had passed
robertfrost,Before we met and you what I had passed.
robertfrost,HYLA BROOK
robertfrost,By June our brook's run out of song and speed.
robertfrost,"Sought for much after that, it will be found"
robertfrost,Either to have gone groping underground
robertfrost,(And taken with it all the Hyla breed
robertfrost,"That shouted in the mist a month ago,"
robertfrost,Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow)--
robertfrost,"Or flourished and come up in jewel-weed,"
robertfrost,Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent
robertfrost,Even against the way its waters went.
robertfrost,Its bed is left a faded paper sheet
robertfrost,Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat--
robertfrost,A brook to none but who remember long.
robertfrost,This as it will be seen is other far
robertfrost,Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song.
robertfrost,We love the things we love for what they are.
robertfrost,THE OVEN BIRD
robertfrost,"There is a singer everyone has heard,"
robertfrost,"Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,"
robertfrost,Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.
robertfrost,He says that leaves are old and that for flowers
robertfrost,Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.
robertfrost,He says the early petal-fall is past
robertfrost,When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers
robertfrost,On sunny days a moment overcast;
robertfrost,And comes that other fall we name the fall.
robertfrost,He says the highway dust is over all.
robertfrost,The bird would cease and be as other birds
robertfrost,But that he knows in singing not to sing.
robertfrost,The question that he frames in all but words
robertfrost,Is what to make of a diminished thing.
robertfrost,BOND AND FREE
robertfrost,Love has earth to which she clings
robertfrost,With hills and circling arms about--
robertfrost,Wall within wall to shut fear out.
robertfrost,"But Thought has need of no such things,"
robertfrost,For Thought has a pair of dauntless wings.
robertfrost,"On snow and sand and turf, I see"
robertfrost,Where Love has left a printed trace
robertfrost,With straining in the world's embrace.
robertfrost,And such is Love and glad to be.
robertfrost,But Thought has shaken his ankles free.
robertfrost,Thought cleaves the interstellar gloom
robertfrost,"And sits in Sirius' disc all night,"
robertfrost,"Till day makes him retrace his flight,"
robertfrost,"With smell of burning on every plume,"
robertfrost,Back past the sun to an earthly room.
robertfrost,His gains in heaven are what they are.
robertfrost,Yet some say Love by being thrall
robertfrost,And simply staying possesses all
robertfrost,In several beauty that Thought fares far
robertfrost,To find fused in another star.
robertfrost,BIRCHES
robertfrost,When I see birches bend to left and right
robertfrost,"Across the lines of straighter darker trees,"
robertfrost,I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
robertfrost,But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
robertfrost,Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
robertfrost,Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
robertfrost,After a rain. They click upon themselves
robertfrost,"As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored"
robertfrost,As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
robertfrost,Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
robertfrost,Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust--
robertfrost,Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
robertfrost,You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
robertfrost,"They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,"
robertfrost,And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed
robertfrost,"So low for long, they never right themselves:"
robertfrost,You may see their trunks arching in the woods
robertfrost,"Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground"
robertfrost,Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
robertfrost,Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
robertfrost,But I was going to say when Truth broke in
robertfrost,With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm
robertfrost,(Now am I free to be poetical?)
robertfrost,I should prefer to have some boy bend them
robertfrost,As he went out and in to fetch the cows--
robertfrost,"Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,"
robertfrost,"Whose only play was what he found himself,"
robertfrost,"Summer or winter, and could play alone."
robertfrost,One by one he subdued his father's trees
robertfrost,By riding them down over and over again
robertfrost,"Until he took the stiffness out of them,"
robertfrost,"And not one but hung limp, not one was left"
robertfrost,For him to conquer. He learned all there was
robertfrost,To learn about not launching out too soon
robertfrost,And so not carrying the tree away
robertfrost,Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise
robertfrost,"To the top branches, climbing carefully"
robertfrost,With the same pains you use to fill a cup
robertfrost,"Up to the brim, and even above the brim."
robertfrost,"Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,"
robertfrost,Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.
robertfrost,So was I once myself a swinger of birches.
robertfrost,And so I dream of going back to be.
robertfrost,"It's when I'm weary of considerations,"
robertfrost,And life is too much like a pathless wood
robertfrost,Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
robertfrost,"Broken across it, and one eye is weeping"
robertfrost,From a twig's having lashed across it open.
robertfrost,I'd like to get away from earth awhile
robertfrost,And then come back to it and begin over.
robertfrost,May no fate willfully misunderstand me
robertfrost,And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
robertfrost,Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:
robertfrost,I don't know where it's likely to go better.
robertfrost,"I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,"
robertfrost,And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
robertfrost,"_Toward_ heaven, till the tree could bear no more,"
robertfrost,But dipped its top and set me down again.
robertfrost,That would be good both going and coming back.
robertfrost,One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.
robertfrost,PEA BRUSH
robertfrost,I walked down alone Sunday after church
robertfrost,To the place where John has been cutting trees
robertfrost,To see for myself about the birch
robertfrost,He said I could have to bush my peas.
robertfrost,The sun in the new-cut narrow gap
robertfrost,"Was hot enough for the first of May,"
robertfrost,And stifling hot with the odor of sap
robertfrost,From stumps still bleeding their life away.
robertfrost,The frogs that were peeping a thousand shrill
robertfrost,"Wherever the ground was low and wet,"
robertfrost,The minute they heard my step went still
robertfrost,To watch me and see what I came to get.
robertfrost,Birch boughs enough piled everywhere!--
robertfrost,All fresh and sound from the recent axe.
robertfrost,Time someone came with cart and pair
robertfrost,And got them off the wild flower's backs.
robertfrost,They might be good for garden things
robertfrost,"To curl a little finger round,"
robertfrost,"The same as you seize cat's-cradle strings,"
robertfrost,And lift themselves up off the ground.
robertfrost,"Small good to anything growing wild,"
robertfrost,They were crooking many a trillium
robertfrost,That had budded before the boughs were piled
robertfrost,And since it was coming up had to come.
robertfrost,PUTTING IN THE SEED
robertfrost,You come to fetch me from my work to-night
robertfrost,"When supper's on the table, and we'll see"
robertfrost,If I can leave off burying the white
robertfrost,Soft petals fallen from the apple tree.
robertfrost,"(Soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite,"
robertfrost,"Mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea;)"
robertfrost,And go along with you ere you lose sight
robertfrost,"Of what you came for and become like me,"
robertfrost,Slave to a springtime passion for the earth.
robertfrost,How Love burns through the Putting in the Seed
robertfrost,On through the watching for that early birth
robertfrost,"When, just as the soil tarnishes with weed,"
robertfrost,The sturdy seedling with arched body comes
robertfrost,Shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs.
robertfrost,A TIME TO TALK
robertfrost,When a friend calls to me from the road
robertfrost,"And slows his horse to a meaning walk,"
robertfrost,I don't stand still and look around
robertfrost,"On all the hills I haven't hoed,"
robertfrost,"And shout from where I am, What is it?"
robertfrost,"No, not as there is a time to talk."
robertfrost,"I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,"
robertfrost,"Blade-end up and five feet tall,"
robertfrost,And plod: I go up to the stone wall
robertfrost,For a friendly visit.
robertfrost,THE COW IN APPLE TIME
robertfrost,Something inspires the only cow of late
robertfrost,"To make no more of a wall than an open gate,"
robertfrost,And think no more of wall-builders than fools.
robertfrost,Her face is flecked with pomace and she drools
robertfrost,"A cider syrup. Having tasted fruit,"
robertfrost,She scorns a pasture withering to the root.
robertfrost,She runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten
robertfrost,The windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten.
robertfrost,She leaves them bitten when she has to fly.
robertfrost,She bellows on a knoll against the sky.
robertfrost,Her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry.
robertfrost,AN ENCOUNTER
robertfrost,"Once on the kind of day called ""weather breeder,"""
robertfrost,When the heat slowly hazes and the sun
robertfrost,"By its own power seems to be undone,"
robertfrost,"I was half boring through, half climbing through"
robertfrost,A swamp of cedar. Choked with oil of cedar
robertfrost,"And scurf of plants, and weary and over-heated,"
robertfrost,"And sorry I ever left the road I knew,"
robertfrost,I paused and rested on a sort of hook
robertfrost,"That had me by the coat as good as seated,"
robertfrost,"And since there was no other way to look,"
robertfrost,"Looked up toward heaven, and there against the blue,"
robertfrost,"Stood over me a resurrected tree,"
robertfrost,A tree that had been down and raised again--
robertfrost,"A barkless spectre. He had halted too,"
robertfrost,As if for fear of treading upon me.
robertfrost,I saw the strange position of his hands--
robertfrost,"Up at his shoulders, dragging yellow strands"
robertfrost,Of wire with something in it from men to men.
robertfrost,"""You here?"" I said. ""Where aren't you nowadays"
robertfrost,And what's the news you carry--if you know?
robertfrost,And tell me where you're off for--Montreal?
robertfrost,Me? I'm not off for anywhere at all.
robertfrost,Sometimes I wander out of beaten ways
robertfrost,"Half looking for the orchid Calypso."""
robertfrost,RANGE-FINDING
robertfrost,The battle rent a cobweb diamond-strung
robertfrost,And cut a flower beside a ground bird's nest
robertfrost,Before it stained a single human breast.
robertfrost,The stricken flower bent double and so hung.
robertfrost,And still the bird revisited her young.
robertfrost,A butterfly its fall had dispossessed
robertfrost,"A moment sought in air his flower of rest,"
robertfrost,Then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung.
robertfrost,On the bare upland pasture there had spread
robertfrost,O'ernight 'twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread
robertfrost,And straining cables wet with silver dew.
robertfrost,A sudden passing bullet shook it dry.
robertfrost,"The indwelling spider ran to greet the fly,"
robertfrost,"But finding nothing, sullenly withdrew."
robertfrost,THE HILL WIFE
robertfrost,LONELINESS
robertfrost,(_Her Word_)
robertfrost,One ought not to have to care
robertfrost,So much as you and I
robertfrost,Care when the birds come round the house
robertfrost,To seem to say good-bye;
robertfrost,Or care so much when they come back
robertfrost,With whatever it is they sing;
robertfrost,The truth being we are as much
robertfrost,Too glad for the one thing
robertfrost,As we are too sad for the other here--
robertfrost,With birds that fill their breasts
robertfrost,But with each other and themselves
robertfrost,And their built or driven nests.
robertfrost,HOUSE FEAR
robertfrost,Always--I tell you this they learned--
robertfrost,Always at night when they returned
robertfrost,To the lonely house from far away
robertfrost,"To lamps unlighted and fire gone gray,"
robertfrost,They learned to rattle the lock and key
robertfrost,To give whatever might chance to be
robertfrost,Warning and time to be off in flight:
robertfrost,"And preferring the out- to the in-door night,"
robertfrost,They learned to leave the house-door wide
robertfrost,Until they had lit the lamp inside.
robertfrost,THE SMILE
robertfrost,(_Her Word_)
robertfrost,I didn't like the way he went away.
robertfrost,That smile! It never came of being gay.
robertfrost,Still he smiled--did you see him?--I was sure!
robertfrost,Perhaps because we gave him only bread
robertfrost,And the wretch knew from that that we were poor.
robertfrost,Perhaps because he let us give instead
robertfrost,Of seizing from us as he might have seized.
robertfrost,"Perhaps he mocked at us for being wed,"
robertfrost,Or being very young (and he was pleased
robertfrost,To have a vision of us old and dead).
robertfrost,I wonder how far down the road he's got.
robertfrost,He's watching from the woods as like as not.
robertfrost,THE OFT-REPEATED DREAM
robertfrost,She had no saying dark enough
robertfrost,For the dark pine that kept
robertfrost,Forever trying the window-latch
robertfrost,Of the room where they slept.
robertfrost,The tireless but ineffectual hands
robertfrost,That with every futile pass
robertfrost,Made the great tree seem as a little bird
robertfrost,Before the mystery of glass!
robertfrost,"It never had been inside the room,"
robertfrost,And only one of the two
robertfrost,Was afraid in an oft-repeated dream
robertfrost,Of what the tree might do.
robertfrost,THE IMPULSE
robertfrost,"It was too lonely for her there,"
robertfrost,"And too wild,"
robertfrost,"And since there were but two of them,"
robertfrost,"And no child,"
robertfrost,"And work was little in the house,"
robertfrost,"She was free,"
robertfrost,"And followed where he furrowed field,"
robertfrost,Or felled tree.
robertfrost,She rested on a log and tossed
robertfrost,"The fresh chips,"
robertfrost,With a song only to herself
robertfrost,On her lips.
robertfrost,And once she went to break a bough
robertfrost,Of black alder.
robertfrost,She strayed so far she scarcely heard
robertfrost,When he called her--
robertfrost,And didn't answer--didn't speak--
robertfrost,Or return.
robertfrost,"She stood, and then she ran and hid"
robertfrost,In the fern.
robertfrost,"He never found her, though he looked"
robertfrost,"Everywhere,"
robertfrost,And he asked at her mother's house
robertfrost,Was she there.
robertfrost,Sudden and swift and light as that
robertfrost,"The ties gave,"
robertfrost,And he learned of finalities
robertfrost,Besides the grave.
robertfrost,THE BONFIRE
robertfrost,"""Oh, let's go up the hill and scare ourselves,"
robertfrost,"As reckless as the best of them to-night,"
robertfrost,By setting fire to all the brush we piled
robertfrost,With pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow.
robertfrost,"Oh, let's not wait for rain to make it safe."
robertfrost,The pile is ours: we dragged it bough on bough
robertfrost,Down dark converging paths between the pines.
robertfrost,Let's not care what we do with it to-night.
robertfrost,Divide it? No! But burn it as one pile
robertfrost,The way we piled it. And let's be the talk
robertfrost,Of people brought to windows by a light
robertfrost,Thrown from somewhere against their wall-paper.
robertfrost,"Rouse them all, both the free and not so free"
robertfrost,With saying what they'd like to do to us
robertfrost,For what they'd better wait till we have done.
robertfrost,"Let's all but bring to life this old volcano,"
robertfrost,If that is what the mountain ever was--
robertfrost,"And scare ourselves. Let wild fire loose we will...."""
robertfrost,"""And scare you too?"" the children said together."
robertfrost,"""Why wouldn't it scare me to have a fire"
robertfrost,Begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know
robertfrost,"That still, if I repent, I may recall it,"
robertfrost,But in a moment not: a little spurt
robertfrost,"Of burning fatness, and then nothing but"
robertfrost,"The fire itself can put it out, and that"
robertfrost,"By burning out, and before it burns out"
robertfrost,"It will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars,"
robertfrost,"And sweeping round it with a flaming sword,"
robertfrost,Made the dim trees stand back in wider circle--
robertfrost,Done so much and I know not how much more
robertfrost,I mean it shall not do if I can bind it.
robertfrost,Well if it doesn't with its draft bring on
robertfrost,"A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter,"
robertfrost,As once it did with me upon an April.
robertfrost,The breezes were so spent with winter blowing
robertfrost,They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them
robertfrost,Short of the perch their languid flight was toward;
robertfrost,And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven
robertfrost,As I walked once round it in possession.
robertfrost,But the wind out of doors--you know the saying.
robertfrost,There came a gust. You used to think the trees
robertfrost,Made wind by fanning since you never knew
robertfrost,It blow but that you saw the trees in motion.
robertfrost,Something or someone watching made that gust.
robertfrost,It put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass
robertfrost,Of over-winter with the least tip-touch
robertfrost,Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand.
robertfrost,The place it reached to blackened instantly.
robertfrost,"The black was all there was by day-light,"
robertfrost,That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke--
robertfrost,"And a flame slender as the hepaticas,"
robertfrost,"Blood-root, and violets so soon to be now."
robertfrost,"But the black spread like black death on the ground,"
robertfrost,And I think the sky darkened with a cloud
robertfrost,Like winter and evening coming on together.
robertfrost,There were enough things to be thought of then.
robertfrost,Where the field stretches toward the north
robertfrost,"And setting sun to Hyla brook, I gave it"
robertfrost,"To flames without twice thinking, where it verges"
robertfrost,"Upon the road, to flames too, though in fear"
robertfrost,"They might find fuel there, in withered brake,"
robertfrost,"Grass its full length, old silver golden-rod,"
robertfrost,"And alder and grape vine entanglement,"
robertfrost,To leap the dusty deadline. For my own
robertfrost,I took what front there was beside. I knelt
robertfrost,And thrust hands in and held my face away.
robertfrost,Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating.
robertfrost,A board is the best weapon if you have it.
robertfrost,"I had my coat. And oh, I knew, I knew,"
robertfrost,"And said out loud, I couldn't bide the smother"
robertfrost,And heat so close in; but the thought of all
robertfrost,"The woods and town on fire by me, and all"
robertfrost,The town turned out to fight for me--that held me.
robertfrost,"I trusted the brook barrier, but feared"
robertfrost,The road would fail; and on that side the fire
robertfrost,Died not without a noise of crackling wood--
robertfrost,Of something more than tinder-grass and weed--
robertfrost,That brought me to my feet to hold it back
robertfrost,"By leaning back myself, as if the reins"
robertfrost,Were round my neck and I was at the plough.
robertfrost,I won! But I'm sure no one ever spread
robertfrost,Another color over a tenth the space
robertfrost,That I spread coal-black over in the time
robertfrost,It took me. Neighbors coming home from town
robertfrost,Couldn't believe that so much black had come there
robertfrost,"While they had backs turned, that it hadn't been there"
robertfrost,When they had passed an hour or so before
robertfrost,Going the other way and they not seen it.
robertfrost,They looked about for someone to have done it.
robertfrost,But there was no one. I was somewhere wondering
robertfrost,Where all my weariness had gone and why
robertfrost,I walked so light on air in heavy shoes
robertfrost,In spite of a scorched Fourth-of-July feeling.
robertfrost,"Why wouldn't I be scared remembering that?"""
robertfrost,"""If it scares you, what will it do to us?"""
robertfrost,"""Scare you. But if you shrink from being scared,"
robertfrost,What would you say to war if it should come?
robertfrost,That's what for reasons I should like to know--
robertfrost,"If you can comfort me by any answer."""
robertfrost,"""Oh, but war's not for children--it's for men."""
robertfrost,"""Now we are digging almost down to China."
robertfrost,"My dears, my dears, you thought that--we all thought it."
robertfrost,"So your mistake was ours. Haven't you heard, though,"
robertfrost,About the ships where war has found them out
robertfrost,"At sea, about the towns where war has come"
robertfrost,Through opening clouds at night with droning speed
robertfrost,"Further o'erhead than all but stars and angels,--"
robertfrost,And children in the ships and in the towns?
robertfrost,Haven't you heard what we have lived to learn?
robertfrost,Nothing so new--something we had forgotten:
robertfrost,"_War is for everyone, for children too_."
robertfrost,I wasn't going to tell you and I mustn't.
robertfrost,The best way is to come up hill with me
robertfrost,"And have our fire and laugh and be afraid."""
robertfrost,A GIRL'S GARDEN
robertfrost,A neighbor of mine in the village
robertfrost,Likes to tell how one spring
robertfrost,"When she was a girl on the farm, she did"
robertfrost,A childlike thing.
robertfrost,One day she asked her father
robertfrost,To give her a garden plot
robertfrost,"To plant and tend and reap herself,"
robertfrost,"And he said, ""Why not?"""
robertfrost,In casting about for a corner
robertfrost,He thought of an idle bit
robertfrost,"Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood,"
robertfrost,"And he said, ""Just it."""
robertfrost,"And he said, ""That ought to make you"
robertfrost,"An ideal one-girl farm,"
robertfrost,And give you a chance to put some strength
robertfrost,"On your slim-jim arm."""
robertfrost,"It was not enough of a garden,"
robertfrost,"Her father said, to plough;"
robertfrost,"So she had to work it all by hand,"
robertfrost,But she don't mind now.
robertfrost,She wheeled the dung in the wheelbarrow
robertfrost,Along a stretch of road;
robertfrost,But she always ran away and left
robertfrost,Her not-nice load.
robertfrost,And hid from anyone passing.
robertfrost,And then she begged the seed.
robertfrost,She says she thinks she planted one
robertfrost,Of all things but weed.
robertfrost,"A hill each of potatoes,"
robertfrost,"Radishes, lettuce, peas,"
robertfrost,"Tomatoes, beets, beans, pumpkins, corn,"
robertfrost,And even fruit trees.
robertfrost,"And yes, she has long mistrusted"
robertfrost,That a cider apple tree
robertfrost,"In bearing there to-day is hers,"
robertfrost,Or at least may be.
robertfrost,Her crop was a miscellany
robertfrost,"When all was said and done,"
robertfrost,"A little bit of everything,"
robertfrost,A great deal of none.
robertfrost,_Now_ when she sees in the village
robertfrost,"How village things go,"
robertfrost,"Just when it seems to come in right,"
robertfrost,"She says, ""_I_ know!"
robertfrost,"It's as when I was a farmer----"""
robertfrost,"Oh, never by way of advice!"
robertfrost,And she never sins by telling the tale
robertfrost,To the same person twice.
robertfrost,THE EXPOSED NEST
robertfrost,You were forever finding some new play.
robertfrost,So when I saw you down on hands and knees
robertfrost,"In the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay,"
robertfrost,"Trying, I thought, to set it up on end,"
robertfrost,"I went to show you how to make it stay,"
robertfrost,"If that was your idea, against the breeze,"
robertfrost,"And, if you asked me, even help pretend"
robertfrost,To make it root again and grow afresh.
robertfrost,"But 'twas no make-believe with you to-day,"
robertfrost,"Nor was the grass itself your real concern,"
robertfrost,"Though I found your hand full of wilted fern,"
robertfrost,"Steel-bright June-grass, and blackening heads of clover."
robertfrost,'Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground
robertfrost,The cutter-bar had just gone champing over
robertfrost,(Miraculously without tasting flesh)
robertfrost,And left defenseless to the heat and light.
robertfrost,You wanted to restore them to their right
robertfrost,Of something interposed between their sight
robertfrost,And too much world at once--could means be found.
robertfrost,The way the nest-full every time we stirred
robertfrost,Stood up to us as to a mother-bird
robertfrost,"Whose coming home has been too long deferred,"
robertfrost,Made me ask would the mother-bird return
robertfrost,And care for them in such a change of scene
robertfrost,And might our meddling make her more afraid.
robertfrost,That was a thing we could not wait to learn.
robertfrost,"We saw the risk we took in doing good,"
robertfrost,But dared not spare to do the best we could
robertfrost,Though harm should come of it; so built the screen
robertfrost,"You had begun, and gave them back their shade."
robertfrost,All this to prove we cared. Why is there then
robertfrost,No more to tell? We turned to other things.
robertfrost,I haven't any memory--have you?--
robertfrost,Of ever coming to the place again
robertfrost,"To see if the birds lived the first night through,"
robertfrost,And so at last to learn to use their wings.
robertfrost,"""OUT, OUT--"""
robertfrost,The buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard
robertfrost,"And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,"
robertfrost,Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.
robertfrost,And from there those that lifted eyes could count
robertfrost,Five mountain ranges one behind the other
robertfrost,Under the sunset far into Vermont.
robertfrost,"And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,"
robertfrost,"As it ran light, or had to bear a load."
robertfrost,And nothing happened: day was all but done.
robertfrost,"Call it a day, I wish they might have said"
robertfrost,To please the boy by giving him the half hour
robertfrost,That a boy counts so much when saved from work.
robertfrost,His sister stood beside them in her apron
robertfrost,"To tell them ""Supper."" At the word, the saw,"
robertfrost,"As if to prove saws knew what supper meant,"
robertfrost,"Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap--"
robertfrost,"He must have given the hand. However it was,"
robertfrost,Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!
robertfrost,"The boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh,"
robertfrost,As he swung toward them holding up the hand
robertfrost,"Half in appeal, but half as if to keep"
robertfrost,The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all--
robertfrost,"Since he was old enough to know, big boy"
robertfrost,"Doing a man's work, though a child at heart--"
robertfrost,"He saw all spoiled. ""Don't let him cut my hand off--"
robertfrost,"The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!"""
robertfrost,So. But the hand was gone already.
robertfrost,The doctor put him in the dark of ether.
robertfrost,He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.
robertfrost,And then--the watcher at his pulse took fright.
robertfrost,No one believed. They listened at his heart.
robertfrost,Little--less--nothing!--and that ended it.
robertfrost,"No more to build on there. And they, since they"
robertfrost,"Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs."
robertfrost,BROWN'S DESCENT
robertfrost,OR
robertfrost,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE
robertfrost,Brown lived at such a lofty farm
robertfrost,That everyone for miles could see
robertfrost,His lantern when he did his chores
robertfrost,In winter after half-past three.
robertfrost,And many must have seen him make
robertfrost,"His wild descent from there one night,"
robertfrost,"'Cross lots, 'cross walls, 'cross everything,"
robertfrost,Describing rings of lantern light.
robertfrost,Between the house and barn the gale
robertfrost,Got him by something he had on
robertfrost,And blew him out on the icy crust
robertfrost,"That cased the world, and he was gone!"
robertfrost,"Walls were all buried, trees were few:"
robertfrost,He saw no stay unless he stove
robertfrost,A hole in somewhere with his heel.
robertfrost,But though repeatedly he strove
robertfrost,"And stamped and said things to himself,"
robertfrost,"And sometimes something seemed to yield,"
robertfrost,"He gained no foothold, but pursued"
robertfrost,His journey down from field to field.
robertfrost,Sometimes he came with arms outspread
robertfrost,"Like wings, revolving in the scene"
robertfrost,"Upon his longer axis, and"
robertfrost,With no small dignity of mien.
robertfrost,"Faster or slower as he chanced,"
robertfrost,"Sitting or standing as he chose,"
robertfrost,According as he feared to risk
robertfrost,"His neck, or thought to spare his clothes,"
robertfrost,He never let the lantern drop.
robertfrost,And some exclaimed who saw afar
robertfrost,"The figures he described with it,"
robertfrost,"""I wonder what those signals are"
robertfrost,Brown makes at such an hour of night!
robertfrost,He's celebrating something strange.
robertfrost,"I wonder if he's sold his farm,"
robertfrost,"Or been made Master of the Grange."""
robertfrost,"He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked;"
robertfrost,He fell and made the lantern rattle
robertfrost,(But saved the light from going out.)
robertfrost,So half-way down he fought the battle
robertfrost,Incredulous of his own bad luck.
robertfrost,And then becoming reconciled
robertfrost,"To everything, he gave it up"
robertfrost,And came down like a coasting child.
robertfrost,"""Well--I--be--"" that was all he said,"
robertfrost,"As standing in the river road,"
robertfrost,He looked back up the slippery slope
robertfrost,(Two miles it was) to his abode.
robertfrost,Sometimes as an authority
robertfrost,"On motor-cars, I'm asked if I"
robertfrost,"Should say our stock was petered out,"
robertfrost,And this is my sincere reply:
robertfrost,Yankees are what they always were.
robertfrost,Don't think Brown ever gave up hope
robertfrost,Of getting home again because
robertfrost,He couldn't climb that slippery slope;
robertfrost,Or even thought of standing there
robertfrost,Until the January thaw
robertfrost,Should take the polish off the crust.
robertfrost,"He bowed with grace to natural law,"
robertfrost,"And then went round it on his feet,"
robertfrost,After the manner of our stock;
robertfrost,"Not much concerned for those to whom,"
robertfrost,"At that particular time o'clock,"
robertfrost,It must have looked as if the course
robertfrost,He steered was really straight away
robertfrost,From that which he was headed for--
robertfrost,"Not much concerned for them, I say;"
robertfrost,No more so than became a man--
robertfrost,_And_ politician at odd seasons.
robertfrost,I've kept Brown standing in the cold
robertfrost,While I invested him with reasons;
robertfrost,But now he snapped his eyes three times;
robertfrost,"Then shook his lantern, saying, ""Ile's"
robertfrost,"'Bout out!"" and took the long way home"
robertfrost,"By road, a matter of several miles."
robertfrost,THE GUM-GATHERER
robertfrost,There overtook me and drew me in
robertfrost,"To his down-hill, early-morning stride,"
robertfrost,And set me five miles on my road
robertfrost,"Better than if he had had me ride,"
robertfrost,A man with a swinging bag for load
robertfrost,And half the bag wound round his hand.
robertfrost,We talked like barking above the din
robertfrost,Of water we walked along beside.
robertfrost,And for my telling him where I'd been
robertfrost,And where I lived in mountain land
robertfrost,"To be coming home the way I was,"
robertfrost,He told me a little about himself.
robertfrost,He came from higher up in the pass
robertfrost,Where the grist of the new-beginning brooks
robertfrost,Is blocks split off the mountain mass--
robertfrost,And hopeless grist enough it looks
robertfrost,Ever to grind to soil for grass.
robertfrost,(The way it is will do for moss.)
robertfrost,There he had built his stolen shack.
robertfrost,It had to be a stolen shack
robertfrost,Because of the fears of fire and loss
robertfrost,That trouble the sleep of lumber folk:
robertfrost,Visions of half the world burned black
robertfrost,And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke.
robertfrost,We know who when they come to town
robertfrost,"Bring berries under the wagon seat,"
robertfrost,Or a basket of eggs between their feet;
robertfrost,What this man brought in a cotton sack
robertfrost,"Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce."
robertfrost,He showed me lumps of the scented stuff
robertfrost,"Like uncut jewels, dull and rough."
robertfrost,It comes to market golden brown;
robertfrost,But turns to pink between the teeth.
robertfrost,I told him this is a pleasant life
robertfrost,To set your breast to the bark of trees
robertfrost,"That all your days are dim beneath,"
robertfrost,"And reaching up with a little knife,"
robertfrost,To loose the resin and take it down
robertfrost,And bring it to market when you please.
robertfrost,THE LINE-GANG
robertfrost,Here come the line-gang pioneering by.
robertfrost,They throw a forest down less cut than broken.
robertfrost,"They plant dead trees for living, and the dead"
robertfrost,They string together with a living thread.
robertfrost,They string an instrument against the sky
robertfrost,Wherein words whether beaten out or spoken
robertfrost,Will run as hushed as when they were a thought.
robertfrost,But in no hush they string it: they go past
robertfrost,"With shouts afar to pull the cable taut,"
robertfrost,"To hold it hard until they make it fast,"
robertfrost,"To ease away--they have it. With a laugh,"
robertfrost,An oath of towns that set the wild at naught
robertfrost,They bring the telephone and telegraph.
robertfrost,THE VANISHING RED
robertfrost,He is said to have been the last Red Man
robertfrost,In Acton. And the Miller is said to have laughed--
robertfrost,If you like to call such a sound a laugh.
robertfrost,But he gave no one else a laugher's license.
robertfrost,"For he turned suddenly grave as if to say,"
robertfrost,"""Whose business,--if I take it on myself,"
robertfrost,Whose business--but why talk round the barn?--
robertfrost,"When it's just that I hold with getting a thing done with."""
robertfrost,You can't get back and see it as he saw it.
robertfrost,It's too long a story to go into now.
robertfrost,You'd have to have been there and lived it.
robertfrost,Then you wouldn't have looked on it as just a matter
robertfrost,Of who began it between the two races.
robertfrost,Some guttural exclamation of surprise
robertfrost,The Red Man gave in poking about the mill
robertfrost,Over the great big thumping shuffling mill-stone
robertfrost,Disgusted the Miller physically as coming
robertfrost,From one who had no right to be heard from.
robertfrost,"""Come, John,"" he said, ""you want to see the wheel pit?"""
robertfrost,"He took him down below a cramping rafter,"
robertfrost,"And showed him, through a manhole in the floor,"
robertfrost,"The water in desperate straits like frantic fish,"
robertfrost,"Salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails."
robertfrost,Then he shut down the trap door with a ring in it
robertfrost,"That jangled even above the general noise,"
robertfrost,"And came up stairs alone--and gave that laugh,"
robertfrost,And said something to a man with a meal-sack
robertfrost,That the man with the meal-sack didn't catch--then.
robertfrost,"Oh, yes, he showed John the wheel pit all right."
robertfrost,SNOW
robertfrost,The three stood listening to a fresh access
robertfrost,"Of wind that caught against the house a moment,"
robertfrost,"Gulped snow, and then blew free again--the Coles"
robertfrost,"Dressed, but dishevelled from some hours of sleep,"
robertfrost,Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore.
robertfrost,Meserve was first to speak. He pointed backward
robertfrost,"Over his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying,"
robertfrost,"""You can just see it glancing off the roof"
robertfrost,"Making a great scroll upward toward the sky,"
robertfrost,Long enough for recording all our names on.--
robertfrost,I think I'll just call up my wife and tell her
robertfrost,I'm here--so far--and starting on again.
robertfrost,I'll call her softly so that if she's wise
robertfrost,"And gone to sleep, she needn't wake to answer."""
robertfrost,"Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened."
robertfrost,"""Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I'm at Cole's. I'm late."
robertfrost,I called you up to say Good-night from here
robertfrost,Before I went to say Good-morning there.--
robertfrost,"I thought I would.--I know, but, Lett--I know--"
robertfrost,"I could, but what's the sense? The rest won't be"
robertfrost,"So bad.--Give me an hour for it.--Ho, ho,"
robertfrost,Three hours to here! But that was all up hill;
robertfrost,"The rest is down.--Why no, no, not a wallow:"
robertfrost,They kept their heads and took their time to it
robertfrost,"Like darlings, both of them. They're in the barn.--"
robertfrost,"My dear, I'm coming just the same. I didn't"
robertfrost,"Call you to ask you to invite me home.--"""
robertfrost,"He lingered for some word she wouldn't say,"
robertfrost,"Said it at last himself, ""Good-night,"" and then,"
robertfrost,"Getting no answer, closed the telephone."
robertfrost,The three stood in the lamplight round the table
robertfrost,"With lowered eyes a moment till he said,"
robertfrost,"""I'll just see how the horses are."""
robertfrost,"""Yes, do,"""
robertfrost,Both the Coles said together. Mrs. Cole
robertfrost,"Added: ""You can judge better after seeing.--"
robertfrost,"I want you here with me, Fred. Leave him here,"
robertfrost,Brother Meserve. You know to find your way
robertfrost,"Out through the shed."""
robertfrost,"""I guess I know my way,"
robertfrost,I guess I know where I can find my name
robertfrost,Carved in the shed to tell me who I am
robertfrost,If it don't tell me where I am. I used
robertfrost,"To play--"""
robertfrost,"""You tend your horses and come back."
robertfrost,"Fred Cole, you're going to let him!"""
robertfrost,"""Well, aren't you?"
robertfrost,"How can you help yourself?"""
robertfrost,"""I called him Brother."
robertfrost,"Why did I call him that?"""
robertfrost,"""It's right enough."
robertfrost,That's all you ever heard him called round here.
robertfrost,"He seems to have lost off his Christian name."""
robertfrost,"""Christian enough I should call that myself."
robertfrost,"He took no notice, did he? Well, at least"
robertfrost,"I didn't use it out of love of him,"
robertfrost,The dear knows. I detest the thought of him
robertfrost,With his ten children under ten years old.
robertfrost,"I hate his wretched little Racker Sect,"
robertfrost,"All's ever I heard of it, which isn't much."
robertfrost,"But that's not saying--Look, Fred Cole, it's twelve,"
robertfrost,"Isn't it, now? He's been here half an hour."
robertfrost,He says he left the village store at nine.
robertfrost,Three hours to do four miles--a mile an hour
robertfrost,"Or not much better. Why, it doesn't seem"
robertfrost,As if a man could move that slow and move.
robertfrost,Try to think what he did with all that time.
robertfrost,"And three miles more to go!"""
robertfrost,"""Don't let him go."
robertfrost,"Stick to him, Helen. Make him answer you."
robertfrost,That sort of man talks straight on all his life
robertfrost,"From the last thing he said himself, stone deaf"
robertfrost,To anything anyone else may say.
robertfrost,"I should have thought, though, you could make him hear you."""
robertfrost,"""What is he doing out a night like this?"
robertfrost,"Why can't he stay at home?"""
robertfrost,"""He had to preach."""
robertfrost,"""It's no night to be out."""
robertfrost,"""He may be small,"
robertfrost,"He may be good, but one thing's sure, he's tough."""
robertfrost,"""And strong of stale tobacco."""
robertfrost,"""He'll pull through."""
robertfrost,"""You only say so. Not another house"
robertfrost,Or shelter to put into from this place
robertfrost,"To theirs. I'm going to call his wife again."""
robertfrost,"""Wait and he may. Let's see what he will do."
robertfrost,Let's see if he will think of her again.
robertfrost,But then I doubt he's thinking of himself
robertfrost,"He doesn't look on it as anything."""
robertfrost,"""He shan't go--there!"""
robertfrost,"""It _is_ a night, my dear."""
robertfrost,"""One thing: he didn't drag God into it."""
robertfrost,"""He don't consider it a case for God."""
robertfrost,"""You think so, do you? You don't know the kind."
robertfrost,He's getting up a miracle this minute.
robertfrost,"Privately--to himself, right now, he's thinking"
robertfrost,"He'll make a case of it if he succeeds,"
robertfrost,"But keep still if he fails."""
robertfrost,"""Keep still all over."
robertfrost,"He'll be dead--dead and buried."""
robertfrost,"""Such a trouble!"
robertfrost,Not but I've every reason not to care
robertfrost,What happens to him if it only takes
robertfrost,Some of the sanctimonious conceit
robertfrost,"Out of one of those pious scalawags."""
robertfrost,"""Nonsense to that! You want to see him safe."""
robertfrost,"""You like the runt."""
robertfrost,"""Don't you a little?"""
robertfrost,"""Well,"
robertfrost,"I don't like what he's doing, which is what"
robertfrost,"You like, and like him for."""
robertfrost,"""Oh, yes you do."
robertfrost,You like your fun as well as anyone;
robertfrost,Only you women have to put these airs on
robertfrost,To impress men. You've got us so ashamed
robertfrost,Of being men we can't look at a good fight
robertfrost,Between two boys and not feel bound to stop it.
robertfrost,"Let the man freeze an ear or two, I say.--"
robertfrost,He's here. I leave him all to you. Go in
robertfrost,"And save his life.--All right, come in, Meserve."
robertfrost,"Sit down, sit down. How did you find the horses?"""
robertfrost,"""Fine, fine."""
robertfrost,"""And ready for some more? My wife here"
robertfrost,"Says it won't do. You've got to give it up."""
robertfrost,"""Won't you to please me? Please! If I say please?"
robertfrost,"Mr. Meserve, I'll leave it to _your_ wife."
robertfrost,"What _did_ your wife say on the telephone?"""
robertfrost,Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp
robertfrost,Or something not far from it on the table.
robertfrost,"By straightening out and lifting a forefinger,"
robertfrost,He pointed with his hand from where it lay
robertfrost,Like a white crumpled spider on his knee:
robertfrost,"""That leaf there in your open book! It moved"
robertfrost,"Just then, I thought. It's stood erect like that,"
robertfrost,"There on the table, ever since I came,"
robertfrost,"Trying to turn itself backward or forward,"
robertfrost,I've had my eye on it to make out which;
robertfrost,"If forward, then it's with a friend's impatience--"
robertfrost,You see I know--to get you on to things
robertfrost,"It wants to see how you will take, if backward"
robertfrost,It's from regret for something you have passed
robertfrost,"And failed to see the good of. Never mind,"
robertfrost,Things must expect to come in front of us
robertfrost,A many times--I don't say just how many--
robertfrost,That varies with the things--before we see them.
robertfrost,One of the lies would make it out that nothing
robertfrost,Ever presents itself before us twice.
robertfrost,Where would we be at last if that were so?
robertfrost,Our very life depends on everything's
robertfrost,Recurring till we answer from within.
robertfrost,The thousandth time may prove the charm.--That leaf!
robertfrost,It can't turn either way. It needs the wind's help.
robertfrost,But the wind didn't move it if it moved.
robertfrost,It moved itself. The wind's at naught in here.
robertfrost,It couldn't stir so sensitively poised
robertfrost,A thing as that. It couldn't reach the lamp
robertfrost,"To get a puff of black smoke from the flame,"
robertfrost,Or blow a rumple in the collie's coat.
robertfrost,"You make a little foursquare block of air,"
robertfrost,"Quiet and light and warm, in spite of all"
robertfrost,"The illimitable dark and cold and storm,"
robertfrost,"And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,"
robertfrost,"And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;"
robertfrost,"Though for all anyone can tell, repose"
robertfrost,"May be the thing you haven't, yet you give it."
robertfrost,So false it is that what we haven't we can't give;
robertfrost,"So false, that what we always say is true."
robertfrost,I'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.
robertfrost,"It won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?"""
robertfrost,"""I shouldn't want to hurry you, Meserve,"
robertfrost,"But if you're going--Say you'll stay, you know?"
robertfrost,"But let me raise this curtain on a scene,"
robertfrost,And show you how it's piling up against you.
robertfrost,You see the snow-white through the white of frost?
robertfrost,Ask Helen how far up the sash it's climbed
robertfrost,"Since last we read the gage."""
robertfrost,"""It looks as if"
robertfrost,Some pallid thing had squashed its features flat
robertfrost,And its eyes shut with overeagerness
robertfrost,To see what people found so interesting
robertfrost,"In one another, and had gone to sleep"
robertfrost,"Of its own stupid lack of understanding,"
robertfrost,Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff
robertfrost,"Short off, and died against the window-pane."""
robertfrost,"""Brother Meserve, take care, you'll scare yourself"
robertfrost,More than you will us with such nightmare talk.
robertfrost,"It's you it matters to, because it's you"
robertfrost,"Who have to go out into it alone."""
robertfrost,"""Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he'll stay."""
robertfrost,"""Before you drop the curtain--I'm reminded:"
robertfrost,You recollect the boy who came out here
robertfrost,To breathe the air one winter--had a room
robertfrost,"Down at the Averys'? Well, one sunny morning"
robertfrost,"After a downy storm, he passed our place"
robertfrost,And found me banking up the house with snow.
robertfrost,"And I was burrowing in deep for warmth,"
robertfrost,Piling it well above the window-sills.
robertfrost,The snow against the window caught his eye.
robertfrost,"'Hey, that's a pretty thought'--those were his words."
robertfrost,"'So you can think it's six feet deep outside,"
robertfrost,While you sit warm and read up balanced rations.
robertfrost,You can't get too much winter in the winter.'
robertfrost,Those were his words. And he went home and all
robertfrost,But banked the daylight out of Avery's windows.
robertfrost,Now you and I would go to no such length.
robertfrost,At the same time you can't deny it makes
robertfrost,"It not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,"
robertfrost,"Playing our fancy, to have the snowline run"
robertfrost,So high across the pane outside. There where
robertfrost,There is a sort of tunnel in the frost
robertfrost,More like a tunnel than a hole--way down
robertfrost,At the far end of it you see a stir
robertfrost,And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift
robertfrost,Blown in the wind. I _like_ that--I like _that_.
robertfrost,"Well, now I leave you, people."""
robertfrost,"""Come, Meserve,"
robertfrost,We thought you were deciding not to go--
robertfrost,The ways you found to say the praise of comfort
robertfrost,"And being where you are. You want to stay."""
robertfrost,"""I'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow."
robertfrost,"This house is frozen brittle, all except"
robertfrost,This room you sit in. If you think the wind
robertfrost,"Sounds further off, it's not because it's dying;"
robertfrost,You're further under in the snow--that's all--
robertfrost,And feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust
robertfrost,"It bursts against us at the chimney mouth,"
robertfrost,And at the eaves. I like it from inside
robertfrost,More than I shall out in it. But the horses
robertfrost,"Are rested and it's time to say good-night,"
robertfrost,"And let you get to bed again. Good-night,"
robertfrost,"Sorry I had to break in on your sleep."""
robertfrost,"""Lucky for you you did. Lucky for you"
robertfrost,You had us for a half-way station
robertfrost,To stop at. If you were the kind of man
robertfrost,"Paid heed to women, you'd take my advice"
robertfrost,And for your family's sake stay where you are.
robertfrost,But what good is my saying it over and over?
robertfrost,You've done more than you had a right to think
robertfrost,You could do--_now_. You know the risk you take
robertfrost,"In going on."""
robertfrost,"""Our snow-storms as a rule"
robertfrost,"Aren't looked on as man-killers, and although"
robertfrost,I'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep
robertfrost,"Under it all, his door sealed up and lost,"
robertfrost,"Than the man fighting it to keep above it,"
robertfrost,Yet think of the small birds at roost and not
robertfrost,In nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?
robertfrost,Their bulk in water would be frozen rock
robertfrost,In no time out to-night. And yet to-morrow
robertfrost,They will come budding boughs from tree to tree
robertfrost,"Flirting their wings and saying Chickadee,"
robertfrost,"As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm."""
robertfrost,"""But why when no one wants you to go on?"
robertfrost,"Your wife--she doesn't want you to. We don't,"
robertfrost,"And you yourself don't want to. Who else is there?"""
robertfrost,"""Save us from being cornered by a woman."
robertfrost,"Well, there's""--She told Fred afterward that in"
robertfrost,"The pause right there, she thought the dreaded word"
robertfrost,"Was coming, ""God."" But no, he only said"
robertfrost,"""Well, there's--the storm. That says I must go on."
robertfrost,That wants me as a war might if it came.
robertfrost,"Ask any man."""
robertfrost,He threw her that as something
robertfrost,To last her till he got outside the door.
robertfrost,He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.
robertfrost,When Cole returned he found his wife still standing
robertfrost,"Beside the table near the open book,"
robertfrost,Not reading it.
robertfrost,"""Well, what kind of a man"
robertfrost,"Do you call that?"" she said."
robertfrost,"""He had the gift"
robertfrost,"Of words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?"""
robertfrost,"""Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?"""
robertfrost,"""Or disregarding people's civil questions--"
robertfrost,What? We've found out in one hour more about him
robertfrost,Than we had seeing him pass by in the road
robertfrost,A thousand times. If that's the way he preaches!
robertfrost,You didn't think you'd keep him after all.
robertfrost,"Oh, I'm not blaming you. He didn't leave you"
robertfrost,"Much say in the matter, and I'm just as glad"
robertfrost,We're not in for a night of him. No sleep
robertfrost,If he had stayed. The least thing set him going.
robertfrost,"It's quiet as an empty church without him."""
robertfrost,"""But how much better off are we as it is?"
robertfrost,"We'll have to sit here till we know he's safe."""
robertfrost,"""Yes, I suppose you'll want to, but I shouldn't."
robertfrost,"He knows what he can do, or he wouldn't try."
robertfrost,"Get into bed I say, and get some rest."
robertfrost,"He won't come back, and if he telephones,"
robertfrost,"It won't be for an hour or two."""
robertfrost,"""Well then."
robertfrost,We can't be any help by sitting here
robertfrost,"And living his fight through with him, I suppose."""
robertfrost,*       *       *       *       *
robertfrost,Cole had been telephoning in the dark.
robertfrost,Mrs. Cole's voice came from an inner room:
robertfrost,"""Did she call you or you call her?"""
robertfrost,"""She me."
robertfrost,You'd better dress: you won't go back to bed.
robertfrost,"We must have been asleep: it's three and after."""
robertfrost,"""Had she been ringing long? I'll get my wrapper."
robertfrost,"I want to speak to her."""
robertfrost,"""All she said was,"
robertfrost,"He hadn't come and had he really started."""
robertfrost,"""She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago."""
robertfrost,"""He had the shovel. He'll have made a fight."""
robertfrost,"""Why did I ever let him leave this house!"""
robertfrost,"""Don't begin that. You did the best you could"
robertfrost,To keep him--though perhaps you didn't quite
robertfrost,Conceal a wish to see him show the spunk

robertfrost,"""Fred, after all I said! You shan't make out"
robertfrost,That it was any way but what it was.
robertfrost,Did she let on by any word she said
robertfrost,"She didn't thank me?"""
robertfrost,"""When I told her 'Gone,'"
robertfrost,"'Well then,' she said, and 'Well then'--like a threat."
robertfrost,"And then her voice came scraping slow: 'Oh, you,"
robertfrost,"Why did you let him go'?"""
robertfrost,"""Asked why we let him?"
robertfrost,You let me there. I'll ask her why she let him.
robertfrost,She didn't dare to speak when he was here.
robertfrost,Their number's--twenty-one? The thing won't work.
robertfrost,Someone's receiver's down. The handle stumbles.
robertfrost,"The stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm!"
robertfrost,"It's theirs. She's dropped it from her hand and gone."""
robertfrost,"""Try speaking. Say 'Hello'!"""
robertfrost,"""Hello. Hello."""
robertfrost,"""What do you hear?"""
robertfrost,"""I hear an empty room--"
robertfrost,"You know--it sounds that way. And yes, I hear--"
robertfrost,I think I hear a clock--and windows rattling.
robertfrost,"No step though. If she's there she's sitting down."""
robertfrost,"""Shout, she may hear you."""
robertfrost,"""Shouting is no good."""
robertfrost,"""Keep speaking then."""

robertfrost,"""A baby's crying!"
robertfrost,"Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off."""
robertfrost,"""Its mother wouldn't let it cry like that,"
robertfrost,"Not if she's there."""
robertfrost,"""What do you make of it?"""
robertfrost,"""There's only one thing possible to make,"
robertfrost,"That is, assuming--that she has gone out."
robertfrost,"Of course she hasn't though."" They both sat down"
robertfrost,"Helpless. ""There's nothing we can do till morning."""
robertfrost,"""Fred, I shan't let you think of going out."""
robertfrost,"""Hold on."" The double bell began to chirp."
robertfrost,They started up. Fred took the telephone.
robertfrost,"""Hello, Meserve. You're there, then!--And your wife?"
robertfrost,Good! Why I asked--she didn't seem to answer.
robertfrost,He says she went to let him in the barn.--
robertfrost,"We're glad. Oh, say no more about it, man."
robertfrost,"Drop in and see us when you're passing."""
robertfrost,"""Well,"
robertfrost,"She has him then, though what she wants him for"
robertfrost,"I _don't_ see."""
robertfrost,"""Possibly not for herself."
robertfrost,"Maybe she only wants him for the children."""
robertfrost,"""The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing."
robertfrost,What spoiled our night was to him just his fun.
robertfrost,What did he come in for?--To talk and visit?
robertfrost,Thought he'd just call to tell us it was snowing.
robertfrost,If he thinks he is going to make our house
robertfrost,"A halfway coffee house 'twixt town and nowhere----"""
robertfrost,"""I thought you'd feel you'd been too much concerned."""
robertfrost,"""You think you haven't been concerned yourself."""
robertfrost,"""If you mean he was inconsiderate"
robertfrost,To rout us out to think for him at midnight
robertfrost,"And then take our advice no more than nothing,"
robertfrost,"Why, I agree with you. But let's forgive him."
robertfrost,We've had a share in one night of his life.
robertfrost,"What'll you bet he ever calls again?"""
robertfrost,_THE SOUND OF THE TREES_
robertfrost,_I wonder about the trees.
robertfrost,Why do we wish to bear
robertfrost,Forever the noise of these
robertfrost,More than another noise
robertfrost,So close to our dwelling place?
robertfrost,We suffer them by the day
robertfrost,"Till we lose all measure of pace,"
robertfrost,"And fixity in our joys,"
robertfrost,And acquire a listening air.
robertfrost,They are that that talks of going
robertfrost,But never gets away;
robertfrost,"And that talks no less for knowing,"
robertfrost,"As it grows wiser and older,"
robertfrost,That now it means to stay.
robertfrost,My feet tug at the floor
robertfrost,And my head sways to my shoulder
robertfrost,"Sometimes when I watch trees sway,"
robertfrost,From the window or the door.
robertfrost,"I shall set forth for somewhere,"
robertfrost,I shall make the reckless choice
robertfrost,Some day when they are in voice
robertfrost,And tossing so as to scare
robertfrost,The white clouds over them on.
robertfrost,"I shall have less to say,"
robertfrost,But I shall be gone._
