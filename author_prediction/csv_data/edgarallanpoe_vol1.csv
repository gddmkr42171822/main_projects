edgarallanpoe,AN APPRECIATION
edgarallanpoe,Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
edgarallanpoe,Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--
edgarallanpoe,Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
edgarallanpoe,Of “never--never more!”
edgarallanpoe,THIS stanza from “The Raven” was recommended by James Russell Lowell as
edgarallanpoe,an inscription upon the Baltimore monument which marks the resting place
edgarallanpoe,"of Edgar Allan Poe, the most interesting and original figure in American"
edgarallanpoe,"letters. And, to signify that peculiar musical quality of Poe’s genius"
edgarallanpoe,"which inthralls every reader, Mr. Lowell suggested this additional"
edgarallanpoe,"verse, from the “Haunted Palace”:"
edgarallanpoe,And all with pearl and ruby glowing
edgarallanpoe,"Was the fair palace door,"
edgarallanpoe,"Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,"
edgarallanpoe,"And sparkling ever more,"
edgarallanpoe,"A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty"
edgarallanpoe,"Was but to sing,"
edgarallanpoe,"In voices of surpassing beauty,"
edgarallanpoe,The wit and wisdom of their king.
edgarallanpoe,"Born in poverty at Boston, January 19, 1809, dying under painful"
edgarallanpoe,"circumstances at Baltimore, October 7, 1849, his whole literary career"
edgarallanpoe,"of scarcely fifteen years a pitiful struggle for mere subsistence, his"
edgarallanpoe,"memory malignantly misrepresented by his earliest biographer, Griswold,"
edgarallanpoe,how completely has truth at last routed falsehood and how magnificently
edgarallanpoe,"has Poe come into his own. For “The Raven,” first published in 1845,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, within a few months, read, recited and parodied wherever the"
edgarallanpoe,"English language was spoken, the half-starved poet received $10! Less"
edgarallanpoe,"than a year later his brother poet, N. P. Willis, issued this touching"
edgarallanpoe,"appeal to the admirers of genius on behalf of the neglected author, his"
edgarallanpoe,"dying wife and her devoted mother, then living under very straitened"
edgarallanpoe,"circumstances in a little cottage at Fordham, N. Y.:"
edgarallanpoe,"“Here is one of the finest scholars, one of the most original men of"
edgarallanpoe,"genius, and one of the most industrious of the literary profession of"
edgarallanpoe,"our country, whose temporary suspension of labor, from bodily illness,"
edgarallanpoe,drops him immediately to a level with the common objects of public
edgarallanpoe,"charity. There is no intermediate stopping-place, no respectful shelter,"
edgarallanpoe,"where, with the delicacy due to genius and culture, he might secure"
edgarallanpoe,"aid, till, with returning health, he would resume his labors, and his"
edgarallanpoe,unmortified sense of independence.”
edgarallanpoe,And this was the tribute paid by the American public to the master who
edgarallanpoe,"had given to it such tales of conjuring charm, of witchery and mystery"
edgarallanpoe,as “The Fall of the House of Usher” and “Ligeia”; such fascinating
edgarallanpoe,"hoaxes as “The Unparalleled Adventure of Hans Pfaall,” “MSS. Found in a"
edgarallanpoe,"Bottle,” “A Descent Into a Maelstrom” and “The Balloon-Hoax”; such tales"
edgarallanpoe,"of conscience as “William Wilson,” “The Black Cat” and “The Tell-tale"
edgarallanpoe,"Heart,” wherein the retributions of remorse are portrayed with an awful"
edgarallanpoe,fidelity; such tales of natural beauty as “The Island of the Fay” and
edgarallanpoe,“The Domain of Arnheim”; such marvellous studies in ratiocination as the
edgarallanpoe,"“Gold-bug,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” “The Purloined Letter”"
edgarallanpoe,"and “The Mystery of Marie Roget,” the latter, a recital of fact,"
edgarallanpoe,demonstrating the author’s wonderful capability of correctly analyzing
edgarallanpoe,the mysteries of the human mind; such tales of illusion and banter
edgarallanpoe,as “The Premature Burial” and “The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor
edgarallanpoe,Fether”; such bits of extravaganza as “The Devil in the Belfry” and “The
edgarallanpoe,Angel of the Odd”; such tales of adventure as “The Narrative of Arthur
edgarallanpoe,Gordon Pym”; such papers of keen criticism and review as won for Poe the
edgarallanpoe,"enthusiastic admiration of Charles Dickens, although they made him many"
edgarallanpoe,enemies among the over-puffed minor American writers so mercilessly
edgarallanpoe,"exposed by him; such poems of beauty and melody as “The Bells,” “The"
edgarallanpoe,"Haunted Palace,” “Tamerlane,” “The City in the Sea” and “The Raven.”"
edgarallanpoe,What delight for the jaded senses of the reader is this enchanted domain
edgarallanpoe,"of wonder-pieces! What an atmosphere of beauty, music, color! What"
edgarallanpoe,"resources of imagination, construction, analysis and absolute art! One"
edgarallanpoe,"might almost sympathize with Sarah Helen Whitman, who, confessing to"
edgarallanpoe,"a half faith in the old superstition of the significance of anagrams,"
edgarallanpoe,"found, in the transposed letters of Edgar Poe’s name, the words “a"
edgarallanpoe,"God-peer.” His mind, she says, was indeed a “Haunted Palace,” echoing to"
edgarallanpoe,the footfalls of angels and demons.
edgarallanpoe,"“No man,” Poe himself wrote, “has recorded, no man has dared to record,"
edgarallanpoe,the wonders of his inner life.”
edgarallanpoe,"In these twentieth century days--of lavish recognition--artistic,"
edgarallanpoe,"popular and material--of genius, what rewards might not a Poe claim!"
edgarallanpoe,"Edgar’s father, a son of General David Poe, the American revolutionary"
edgarallanpoe,"patriot and friend of Lafayette, had married Mrs. Hopkins, an English"
edgarallanpoe,"actress, and, the match meeting with parental disapproval, had himself"
edgarallanpoe,taken to the stage as a profession. Notwithstanding Mrs. Poe’s beauty
edgarallanpoe,and talent the young couple had a sorry struggle for existence. When
edgarallanpoe,"Edgar, at the age of two years, was orphaned, the family was in the"
edgarallanpoe,utmost destitution. Apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the
edgarallanpoe,world homeless and friendless. But fate decreed that a few glimmers of
edgarallanpoe,"sunshine were to illumine his life, for the little fellow was adopted"
edgarallanpoe,"by John Allan, a wealthy merchant of Richmond, Va. A brother and sister,"
edgarallanpoe,"the remaining children, were cared for by others."
edgarallanpoe,In his new home Edgar found all the luxury and advantages money could
edgarallanpoe,"provide. He was petted, spoiled and shown off to strangers. In Mrs."
edgarallanpoe,Allan he found all the affection a childless wife could bestow. Mr.
edgarallanpoe,"Allan took much pride in the captivating, precocious lad. At the age of"
edgarallanpoe,"five the boy recited, with fine effect, passages of English poetry to"
edgarallanpoe,the visitors at the Allan house.
edgarallanpoe,From his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the Manor House
edgarallanpoe,"school, at Stoke-Newington, a suburb of London. It was the Rev. Dr."
edgarallanpoe,"Bransby, head of the school, whom Poe so quaintly portrayed in “William"
edgarallanpoe,Wilson.” Returning to Richmond in 1820 Edgar was sent to the school
edgarallanpoe,of Professor Joseph H. Clarke. He proved an apt pupil. Years afterward
edgarallanpoe,Professor Clarke thus wrote:
edgarallanpoe,"“While the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses, Poe wrote genuine"
edgarallanpoe,poetry; the boy was a born poet. As a scholar he was ambitious to
edgarallanpoe,"excel. He was remarkable for self-respect, without haughtiness. He had"
edgarallanpoe,a sensitive and tender heart and would do anything for a friend. His
edgarallanpoe,nature was entirely free from selfishness.”
edgarallanpoe,At the age of seventeen Poe entered the University of Virginia at
edgarallanpoe,Charlottesville. He left that institution after one session. Official
edgarallanpoe,"records prove that he was not expelled. On the contrary, he gained"
edgarallanpoe,"a creditable record as a student, although it is admitted that he"
edgarallanpoe,contracted debts and had “an ungovernable passion for card-playing.”
edgarallanpoe,These debts may have led to his quarrel with Mr. Allan which eventually
edgarallanpoe,compelled him to make his own way in the world.
edgarallanpoe,Early in 1827 Poe made his first literary venture. He induced Calvin
edgarallanpoe,"Thomas, a poor and youthful printer, to publish a small volume of his"
edgarallanpoe,verses under the title “Tamerlane and Other Poems.” In 1829 we find Poe
edgarallanpoe,"in Baltimore with another manuscript volume of verses, which was soon"
edgarallanpoe,"published. Its title was “Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Other Poems.” Neither"
edgarallanpoe,of these ventures seems to have attracted much attention.
edgarallanpoe,"Soon after Mrs. Allan’s death, which occurred in 1829, Poe, through"
edgarallanpoe,"the aid of Mr. Allan, secured admission to the United States Military"
edgarallanpoe,Academy at West Point. Any glamour which may have attached to cadet life
edgarallanpoe,"in Poe’s eyes was speedily lost, for discipline at West Point was never"
edgarallanpoe,so severe nor were the accommodations ever so poor. Poe’s bent was
edgarallanpoe,more and more toward literature. Life at the academy daily became
edgarallanpoe,increasingly distasteful. Soon he began to purposely neglect his studies
edgarallanpoe,"and to disregard his duties, his aim being to secure his dismissal from"
edgarallanpoe,"the United States service. In this he succeeded. On March 7, 1831, Poe"
edgarallanpoe,found himself free. Mr. Allan’s second marriage had thrown the lad on
edgarallanpoe,his own resources. His literary career was to begin.
edgarallanpoe,"Poe’s first genuine victory was won in 1833, when he was the successful"
edgarallanpoe,competitor for a prize of $100 offered by a Baltimore periodical for the
edgarallanpoe,best prose story. “A MSS. Found in a Bottle” was the winning tale. Poe
edgarallanpoe,"had submitted six stories in a volume. “Our only difficulty,” says Mr."
edgarallanpoe,"Latrobe, one of the judges, “was in selecting from the rich contents of"
edgarallanpoe,the volume.”
edgarallanpoe,During the fifteen years of his literary life Poe was connected with
edgarallanpoe,"various newspapers and magazines in Richmond, Philadelphia and New York."
edgarallanpoe,"He was faithful, punctual, industrious, thorough. N. P. Willis, who for"
edgarallanpoe,"some time employed Poe as critic and sub-editor on the “Evening Mirror,”"
edgarallanpoe,wrote thus:
edgarallanpoe,"“With the highest admiration for Poe’s genius, and a willingness to"
edgarallanpoe,"let it alone for more than ordinary irregularity, we were led by"
edgarallanpoe,"common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties, and"
edgarallanpoe,"occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time went on,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious. We saw but"
edgarallanpoe,"one presentiment of the man-a quiet, patient, industrious and most"
edgarallanpoe,gentlemanly person.
edgarallanpoe,"“We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be stated in all"
edgarallanpoe,"mention of his lamentable irregularities), that with a single glass of"
edgarallanpoe,"wine his whole nature was reversed, the demon became uppermost, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"though none of the usual signs of intoxication were visible, his will"
edgarallanpoe,"was palpably insane. In this reversed character, we repeat, it was never"
edgarallanpoe,our chance to meet him.”
edgarallanpoe,"On September 22, 1835, Poe married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in"
edgarallanpoe,"Baltimore. She had barely turned thirteen years, Poe himself was but"
edgarallanpoe,twenty-six. He then was a resident of Richmond and a regular contributor
edgarallanpoe,to the “Southern Literary Messenger.” It was not until a year later that
edgarallanpoe,the bride and her widowed mother followed him thither.
edgarallanpoe,Poe’s devotion to his child-wife was one of the most beautiful features
edgarallanpoe,of his life. Many of his famous poetic productions were inspired by her
edgarallanpoe,"beauty and charm. Consumption had marked her for its victim, and the"
edgarallanpoe,constant efforts of husband and mother were to secure for her all the
edgarallanpoe,comfort and happiness their slender means permitted. Virginia died
edgarallanpoe,"January 30, 1847, when but twenty-five years of age. A friend of the"
edgarallanpoe,family pictures the death-bed scene--mother and husband trying to impart
edgarallanpoe,"warmth to her by chafing her hands and her feet, while her pet cat was"
edgarallanpoe,suffered to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth.
edgarallanpoe,"These verses from “Annabel Lee,” written by Poe in 1849, the last year"
edgarallanpoe,"of his life, tell of his sorrow at the loss of his child-wife:"
edgarallanpoe,"I was a child and _she_ was a child,"
edgarallanpoe,In a kingdom by the sea;
edgarallanpoe,But we loved with _a _love that was more than love--
edgarallanpoe,I and my Annabel Lee;
edgarallanpoe,With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
edgarallanpoe,Coveted her and me.
edgarallanpoe,"And this was the reason that, long ago;"
edgarallanpoe,In this kingdom by the sea.
edgarallanpoe,"A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling"
edgarallanpoe,My beautiful Annabel Lee;
edgarallanpoe,So that her high-born kinsmen came
edgarallanpoe,"And bore her away from me,"
edgarallanpoe,To shut her up in a sepulchre
edgarallanpoe,"In this kingdom by the sea,"
edgarallanpoe,Poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with the
edgarallanpoe,"“Southern Literary Messenger” in Richmond, Va.; “Graham’s Magazine” and"
edgarallanpoe,"the “Gentleman’s Magazine” in Philadelphia; the “Evening Mirror,” the"
edgarallanpoe,"“Broadway Journal,” and “Godey’s Lady’s Book” in New York. Everywhere"
edgarallanpoe,Poe’s life was one of unremitting toil. No tales and poems were ever
edgarallanpoe,produced at a greater cost of brain and spirit.
edgarallanpoe,"Poe’s initial salary with the “Southern Literary Messenger,” to which"
edgarallanpoe,"he contributed the first drafts of a number of his best-known tales,"
edgarallanpoe,was $10 a week! Two years later his salary was but $600 a year. Even in
edgarallanpoe,"1844, when his literary reputation was established securely, he wrote to"
edgarallanpoe,a friend expressing his pleasure because a magazine to which he was to
edgarallanpoe,contribute had agreed to pay him $20 monthly for two pages of criticism.
edgarallanpoe,"Those were discouraging times in American literature, but Poe never"
edgarallanpoe,lost faith. He was finally to triumph wherever pre-eminent talents win
edgarallanpoe,admirers. His genius has had no better description than in this stanza
edgarallanpoe,"from William Winter’s poem, read at the dedication exercises of the"
edgarallanpoe,"Actors’ Monument to Poe, May 4, 1885, in New York:"
edgarallanpoe,"He was the voice of beauty and of woe,"
edgarallanpoe,Passion and mystery and the dread unknown;
edgarallanpoe,"Pure as the mountains of perpetual snow,"
edgarallanpoe,"Cold as the icy winds that round them moan,"
edgarallanpoe,"Dark as the caves wherein earth’s thunders groan,"
edgarallanpoe,"Wild as the tempests of the upper sky,"
edgarallanpoe,"Sweet as the faint, far-off celestial tone of angel"
edgarallanpoe,"whispers, fluttering from on high,"
edgarallanpoe,And tender as love’s tear when youth and beauty die.
edgarallanpoe,In the two and a half score years that have elapsed since Poe’s death
edgarallanpoe,he has come fully into his own. For a while Griswold’s malignant
edgarallanpoe,misrepresentations colored the public estimate of Poe as man and as
edgarallanpoe,"writer. But, thanks to J. H. Ingram, W. F. Gill, Eugene Didier, Sarah"
edgarallanpoe,Helen Whitman and others these scandals have been dispelled and Poe is
edgarallanpoe,"seen as he actually was-not as a man without failings, it is true, but"
edgarallanpoe,as the finest and most original genius in American letters. As the
edgarallanpoe,years go on his fame increases. His works have been translated into
edgarallanpoe,many foreign languages. His is a household name in France and England-in
edgarallanpoe,"fact, the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that Poe’s own"
edgarallanpoe,"country has been slow to appreciate him. But that reproach, if it ever"
edgarallanpoe,"was warranted, certainly is untrue."
edgarallanpoe,W. H. R.
edgarallanpoe,EDGAR ALLAN POE
edgarallanpoe,By James Russell Lowell
edgarallanpoe,"THE situation of American literature is anomalous. It has no centre, or,"
edgarallanpoe,"if it have, it is like that of the sphere of Hermes. It is divided"
edgarallanpoe,"into many systems, each revolving round its several suns, and often"
edgarallanpoe,presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of a milk-and-water way.
edgarallanpoe,"Our capital city, unlike London or Paris, is not a great central heart"
edgarallanpoe,"from which life and vigor radiate to the extremities, but resembles more"
edgarallanpoe,an isolated umbilicus stuck down as near as may be to the centre of the
edgarallanpoe,"land, and seeming rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to"
edgarallanpoe,"serve any present need. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, each has its"
edgarallanpoe,literature almost more distinct than those of the different dialects
edgarallanpoe,"of Germany; and the Young Queen of the West has also one of her own,"
edgarallanpoe,of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us dwellers by the
edgarallanpoe,Atlantic.
edgarallanpoe,Perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism of
edgarallanpoe,contemporary literature. It is even more grateful to give praise where
edgarallanpoe,"it is needed than where it is deserved, and friendship so often seduces"
edgarallanpoe,"the iron stylus of justice into a vague flourish, that she writes what"
edgarallanpoe,seems rather like an epitaph than a criticism. Yet if praise be given
edgarallanpoe,"as an alms, we could not drop so poisonous a one into any man’s hat. The"
edgarallanpoe,critic’s ink may suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls
edgarallanpoe,"or of sugar. But it is easier to be generous than to be just, and we"
edgarallanpoe,might readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hiding place
edgarallanpoe,"of truth, did we judge from the amount of water which we usually find"
edgarallanpoe,mixed with it.
edgarallanpoe,Remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of
edgarallanpoe,"imaginative men, but Mr. Poe’s biography displays a vicissitude and"
edgarallanpoe,peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with. The offspring of a
edgarallanpoe,"romantic marriage, and left an orphan at an early age, he was adopted"
edgarallanpoe,"by Mr. Allan, a wealthy Virginian, whose barren marriage-bed seemed the"
edgarallanpoe,warranty of a large estate to the young poet.
edgarallanpoe,"Having received a classical education in England, he returned home and"
edgarallanpoe,"entered the University of Virginia, where, after an extravagant course,"
edgarallanpoe,"followed by reformation at the last extremity, he was graduated with"
edgarallanpoe,the highest honors of his class. Then came a boyish attempt to join the
edgarallanpoe,"fortunes of the insurgent Greeks, which ended at St. Petersburg, where"
edgarallanpoe,"he got into difficulties through want of a passport, from which he"
edgarallanpoe,was rescued by the American consul and sent home. He now entered the
edgarallanpoe,"military academy at West Point, from which he obtained a dismissal"
edgarallanpoe,"on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father, by a second"
edgarallanpoe,"marriage, an event which cut off his expectations as an heir. The death"
edgarallanpoe,"of Mr. Allan, in whose will his name was not mentioned, soon after"
edgarallanpoe,"relieved him of all doubt in this regard, and he committed himself at"
edgarallanpoe,"once to authorship for a support. Previously to this, however, he had"
edgarallanpoe,"published (in 1827) a small volume of poems, which soon ran through"
edgarallanpoe,"three editions, and excited high expectations of its author’s future"
edgarallanpoe,distinction in the minds of many competent judges.
edgarallanpoe,That no certain augury can be drawn from a poet’s earliest lispings
edgarallanpoe,"there are instances enough to prove. Shakespeare’s first poems, though"
edgarallanpoe,"brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness, give but a very faint"
edgarallanpoe,"promise of the directness, condensation and overflowing moral of his"
edgarallanpoe,"maturer works. Perhaps, however, Shakespeare is hardly a case in"
edgarallanpoe,"point, his “Venus and Adonis” having been published, we believe, in his"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty-sixth year. Milton’s Latin verses show tenderness, a fine eye for"
edgarallanpoe,"nature, and a delicate appreciation of classic models, but give no hint"
edgarallanpoe,of the author of a new style in poetry. Pope’s youthful pieces have
edgarallanpoe,"all the sing-song, wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity"
edgarallanpoe,and eloquent irreligion of his later productions. Collins’ callow
edgarallanpoe,namby-pamby died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original genius
edgarallanpoe,which he afterward displayed. We have never thought that the world lost
edgarallanpoe,"more in the “marvellous boy,” Chatterton, than a very ingenious imitator"
edgarallanpoe,of obscure and antiquated dulness. Where he becomes original (as it is
edgarallanpoe,"called), the interest of ingenuity ceases and he becomes stupid. Kirke"
edgarallanpoe,"White’s promises were indorsed by the respectable name of Mr. Southey,"
edgarallanpoe,but surely with no authority from Apollo. They have the merit of a
edgarallanpoe,"traditional piety, which to our mind, if uttered at all, had been less"
edgarallanpoe,"objectionable in the retired closet of a diary, and in the sober raiment"
edgarallanpoe,of prose. They do not clutch hold of the memory with the drowning
edgarallanpoe,pertinacity of Watts; neither have they the interest of his occasional
edgarallanpoe,"simple, lucky beauty. Burns having fortunately been rescued by his"
edgarallanpoe,"humble station from the contaminating society of the “Best models,”"
edgarallanpoe,wrote well and naturally from the first. Had he been unfortunate enough
edgarallanpoe,"to have had an educated taste, we should have had a series of poems from"
edgarallanpoe,"which, as from his letters, we could sift here and there a kernel from"
edgarallanpoe,the mass of chaff. Coleridge’s youthful efforts give no promise whatever
edgarallanpoe,"of that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest, tenderest,"
edgarallanpoe,most original and most purely imaginative poems of modern times. Byron’s
edgarallanpoe,“Hours of Idleness” would never find a reader except from an intrepid
edgarallanpoe,and indefatigable curiosity. In Wordsworth’s first preludings there
edgarallanpoe,is but a dim foreboding of the creator of an era. From Southey’s early
edgarallanpoe,"poems, a safer augury might have been drawn. They show the patient"
edgarallanpoe,"investigator, the close student of history, and the unwearied explorer"
edgarallanpoe,"of the beauties of predecessors, but they give no assurances of a man"
edgarallanpoe,"who should add aught to stock of household words, or to the rarer"
edgarallanpoe,and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor. The earliest
edgarallanpoe,"specimens of Shelley’s poetic mind already, also, give tokens of that"
edgarallanpoe,ethereal sublimation in which the spirit seems to soar above the regions
edgarallanpoe,"of words, but leaves its body, the verse, to be entombed, without hope"
edgarallanpoe,"of resurrection, in a mass of them. Cowley is generally instanced as a"
edgarallanpoe,wonder of precocity. But his early insipidities show only a capacity
edgarallanpoe,for rhyming and for the metrical arrangement of certain conventional
edgarallanpoe,"combinations of words, a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate"
edgarallanpoe,"physical organization, and an unhappy memory. An early poem is only"
edgarallanpoe,"remarkable when it displays an effort of _reason, _and the rudest verses"
edgarallanpoe,"in which we can trace some conception of the ends of poetry, are worth"
edgarallanpoe,"all the miracles of smooth juvenile versification. A school-boy, one"
edgarallanpoe,"would say, might acquire the regular see-saw of Pope merely by an"
edgarallanpoe,association with the motion of the play-ground tilt.
edgarallanpoe,Mr. Poe’s early productions show that he could see through the verse to
edgarallanpoe,"the spirit beneath, and that he already had a feeling that all the life"
edgarallanpoe,and grace of the one must depend on and be modulated by the will of the
edgarallanpoe,other. We call them the most remarkable boyish poems that we have
edgarallanpoe,ever read. We know of none that can compare with them for maturity of
edgarallanpoe,"purpose, and a nice understanding of the effects of language and metre."
edgarallanpoe,Such pieces are only valuable when they display what we can only express
edgarallanpoe,by the contradictory phrase of _innate experience. _We copy one of the
edgarallanpoe,"shorter poems, written when the author was only fourteen. There is a"
edgarallanpoe,"little dimness in the filling up, but the grace and symmetry of the"
edgarallanpoe,outline are such as few poets ever attain. There is a smack of ambrosia
edgarallanpoe,about it.
edgarallanpoe,TO HELEN
edgarallanpoe,"Helen, thy beauty is to me"
edgarallanpoe,"Like those Nicean barks of yore,"
edgarallanpoe,"That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,"
edgarallanpoe,"The weary, way-worn wanderer bore"
edgarallanpoe,To his own native shore.
edgarallanpoe,"On desperate seas long wont to roam,"
edgarallanpoe,"Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,"
edgarallanpoe,Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
edgarallanpoe,To the glory that was Greece
edgarallanpoe,And the grandeur that was Rome.
edgarallanpoe,Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
edgarallanpoe,How statue-like I see thee stand!
edgarallanpoe,"The agate lamp within thy hand,"
edgarallanpoe,"Ah! Psyche, from the regions which"
edgarallanpoe,Are Holy Land!
edgarallanpoe,It is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us. Here is no
edgarallanpoe,"“withering scorn,” no heart “blighted” ere it has safely got into its"
edgarallanpoe,"teens, none of the drawing-room sansculottism which Byron had brought"
edgarallanpoe,"into vogue. All is limpid and serene, with a pleasant dash of the Greek"
edgarallanpoe,"Helicon in it. The melody of the whole, too, is remarkable. It is not of"
edgarallanpoe,that kind which can be demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of
edgarallanpoe,the fingers. It is of that finer sort which the inner ear alone
edgarallanpoe,"_can _estimate. It seems simple, like a Greek column, because of its"
edgarallanpoe,"perfection. In a poem named “Ligeia,” under which title he intended"
edgarallanpoe,"to personify the music of nature, our boy-poet gives us the following"
edgarallanpoe,exquisite picture:
edgarallanpoe,Ligeia! Ligeia!
edgarallanpoe,"My beautiful one,"
edgarallanpoe,Whose harshest idea
edgarallanpoe,"Will to melody run,"
edgarallanpoe,"Say, is it thy will,"
edgarallanpoe,"On the breezes to toss,"
edgarallanpoe,"Or, capriciously still,"
edgarallanpoe,"Like the lone albatross,"
edgarallanpoe,"Incumbent on night,"
edgarallanpoe,"As she on the air,"
edgarallanpoe,To keep watch with delight
edgarallanpoe,On the harmony there?
edgarallanpoe,"John Neal, himself a man of genius, and whose lyre has been too long"
edgarallanpoe,"capriciously silent, appreciated the high merit of these and similar"
edgarallanpoe,"passages, and drew a proud horoscope for their author."
edgarallanpoe,Mr. Poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to call
edgarallanpoe,"_genius_. No man could ever tell us precisely what it is, and yet there"
edgarallanpoe,is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence and its power. Let
edgarallanpoe,"talent writhe and contort itself as it may, it has no such magnetism."
edgarallanpoe,"Larger of bone and sinew it may be, but the wings are wanting. Talent"
edgarallanpoe,"sticks fast to earth, and its most perfect works have still one foot of"
edgarallanpoe,"clay. Genius claims kindred with the very workings of Nature herself, so"
edgarallanpoe,"that a sunset shall seem like a quotation from Dante, and if Shakespeare"
edgarallanpoe,"be read in the very presence of the sea itself, his verses shall but"
edgarallanpoe,seem nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean. Talent may make friends
edgarallanpoe,"for itself, but only genius can give to its creations the divine power"
edgarallanpoe,of winning love and veneration. Enthusiasm cannot cling to what itself
edgarallanpoe,"is unenthusiastic, nor will he ever have disciples who has not himself"
edgarallanpoe,impulsive zeal enough to be a disciple. Great wits are allied to madness
edgarallanpoe,"only inasmuch as they are possessed and carried away by their demon,"
edgarallanpoe,"while talent keeps him, as Paracelsus did, securely prisoned in the"
edgarallanpoe,"pommel of his sword. To the eye of genius, the veil of the spiritual"
edgarallanpoe,world is ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good
edgarallanpoe,and evil who throng continually around it. No man of mere talent ever
edgarallanpoe,flung his inkstand at the devil.
edgarallanpoe,"When we say that Mr. Poe had genius, we do not mean to say that he has"
edgarallanpoe,produced evidence of the highest. But to say that he possesses it at
edgarallanpoe,"all is to say that he needs only zeal, industry, and a reverence for the"
edgarallanpoe,"trust reposed in him, to achieve the proudest triumphs and the greenest"
edgarallanpoe,laurels. If we may believe the Longinuses and Aristotles of our
edgarallanpoe,"newspapers, we have quite too many geniuses of the loftiest order to"
edgarallanpoe,"render a place among them at all desirable, whether for its hardness"
edgarallanpoe,"of attainment or its seclusion. The highest peak of our Parnassus is,"
edgarallanpoe,"according to these gentlemen, by far the most thickly settled portion"
edgarallanpoe,"of the country, a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable"
edgarallanpoe,"residence for individuals of a poetical temperament, if love of"
edgarallanpoe,"solitude be, as immemorial tradition asserts, a necessary part of their"
edgarallanpoe,idiosyncrasy.
edgarallanpoe,"Mr. Poe has two of the prime qualities of genius, a faculty of vigorous"
edgarallanpoe,"yet minute analysis, and a wonderful fecundity of imagination. The first"
edgarallanpoe,"of these faculties is as needful to the artist in words, as a knowledge"
edgarallanpoe,of anatomy is to the artist in colors or in stone. This enables him to
edgarallanpoe,"conceive truly, to maintain a proper relation of parts, and to draw a"
edgarallanpoe,"correct outline, while the second groups, fills up and colors. Both"
edgarallanpoe,of these Mr. Poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his prose
edgarallanpoe,"works, the last predominating in his earlier tales, and the first in his"
edgarallanpoe,"later ones. In judging of the merit of an author, and assigning him his"
edgarallanpoe,"niche among our household gods, we have a right to regard him from"
edgarallanpoe,"our own point of view, and to measure him by our own standard. But,"
edgarallanpoe,"in estimating the amount of power displayed in his works, we must be"
edgarallanpoe,"governed by his own design, and placing them by the side of his own"
edgarallanpoe,"ideal, find how much is wanting. We differ from Mr. Poe in his opinions"
edgarallanpoe,of the objects of art. He esteems that object to be the creation of
edgarallanpoe,"Beauty, and perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we"
edgarallanpoe,"disagree with him. But in what we shall say of his writings, we shall"
edgarallanpoe,take his own standard as our guide. The temple of the god of song is
edgarallanpoe,"equally accessible from every side, and there is room enough in it for"
edgarallanpoe,"all who bring offerings, or seek in oracle."
edgarallanpoe,"In his tales, Mr. Poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in that"
edgarallanpoe,dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of the probable
edgarallanpoe,into the weird confines of superstition and unreality. He combines in
edgarallanpoe,a very remarkable manner two faculties which are seldom found united; a
edgarallanpoe,power of influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows
edgarallanpoe,"of mystery, and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or"
edgarallanpoe,"a button unnoticed. Both are, in truth, the natural results of the"
edgarallanpoe,"predominating quality of his mind, to which we have before alluded,"
edgarallanpoe,analysis. It is this which distinguishes the artist. His mind at once
edgarallanpoe,reaches forward to the effect to be produced. Having resolved to bring
edgarallanpoe,"about certain emotions in the reader, he makes all subordinate parts"
edgarallanpoe,tend strictly to the common centre. Even his mystery is mathematical
edgarallanpoe,to his own mind. To him X is a known quantity all along. In any picture
edgarallanpoe,that he paints he understands the chemical properties of all his
edgarallanpoe,"colors. However vague some of his figures may seem, however formless"
edgarallanpoe,"the shadows, to him the outline is as clear and distinct as that of"
edgarallanpoe,a geometrical diagram. For this reason Mr. Poe has no sympathy with
edgarallanpoe,"Mysticism. The Mystic dwells in the mystery, is enveloped with it; it"
edgarallanpoe,"colors all his thoughts; it affects his optic nerve especially, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"commonest things get a rainbow edging from it. Mr. Poe, on the other"
edgarallanpoe,"hand, is a spectator _ab extra_. He analyzes, he dissects, he watches"
edgarallanpoe,"“with an eye serene,"
edgarallanpoe,"The very pulse of the machine,”"
edgarallanpoe,"for such it practically is to him, with wheels and cogs and piston-rods,"
edgarallanpoe,all working to produce a certain end.
edgarallanpoe,"This analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical, and by giving"
edgarallanpoe,"him the patience to be minute, enables him to throw a wonderful reality"
edgarallanpoe,into his most unreal fancies. A monomania he paints with great power. He
edgarallanpoe,"loves to dissect one of these cancers of the mind, and to trace all the"
edgarallanpoe,"subtle ramifications of its roots. In raising images of horror, also,"
edgarallanpoe,"he has strange success, conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint"
edgarallanpoe,some terrible _doubt _which is the secret of all horror. He leaves to
edgarallanpoe,"imagination the task of finishing the picture, a task to which only she"
edgarallanpoe,is competent.
edgarallanpoe,“For much imaginary work was there;
edgarallanpoe,"Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,"
edgarallanpoe,That for Achilles’ image stood his spear
edgarallanpoe,Grasped in an armed hand; himself behind
edgarallanpoe,"Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind.”"
edgarallanpoe,"Besides the merit of conception, Mr. Poe’s writings have also that of"
edgarallanpoe,form.
edgarallanpoe,"His style is highly finished, graceful and truly classical. It would be"
edgarallanpoe,hard to find a living author who had displayed such varied powers. As an
edgarallanpoe,"example of his style we would refer to one of his tales, “The House"
edgarallanpoe,"of Usher,” in the first volume of his “Tales of the Grotesque and"
edgarallanpoe,"Arabesque.” It has a singular charm for us, and we think that no one"
edgarallanpoe,could read it without being strongly moved by its serene and sombre
edgarallanpoe,"beauty. Had its author written nothing else, it would alone have been"
edgarallanpoe,"enough to stamp him as a man of genius, and the master of a classic"
edgarallanpoe,"style. In this tale occurs, perhaps, the most beautiful of his poems."
edgarallanpoe,The great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the vague and
edgarallanpoe,the unreal as sources of effect. They have not used dread and horror
edgarallanpoe,"alone, but only in combination with other qualities, as means of"
edgarallanpoe,subjugating the fancies of their readers. The loftiest muse has ever a
edgarallanpoe,household and fireside charm about her. Mr. Poe’s secret lies mainly in
edgarallanpoe,the skill with which he has employed the strange fascination of mystery
edgarallanpoe,and terror. In this his success is so great and striking as to deserve
edgarallanpoe,"the name of art, not artifice. We cannot call his materials the noblest"
edgarallanpoe,"or purest, but we must concede to him the highest merit of construction."
edgarallanpoe,"As a critic, Mr. Poe was aesthetically deficient. Unerring in his"
edgarallanpoe,"analysis of dictions, metres and plots, he seemed wanting in the faculty"
edgarallanpoe,"of perceiving the profounder ethics of art. His criticisms are, however,"
edgarallanpoe,distinguished for scientific precision and coherence of logic. They
edgarallanpoe,"have the exactness, and at the same time, the coldness of mathematical"
edgarallanpoe,demonstrations. Yet they stand in strikingly refreshing contrast with
edgarallanpoe,the vague generalisms and sharp personalities of the day. If deficient
edgarallanpoe,"in warmth, they are also without the heat of partisanship. They are"
edgarallanpoe,"especially valuable as illustrating the great truth, too generally"
edgarallanpoe,"overlooked, that analytic power is a subordinate quality of the critic."
edgarallanpoe,"On the whole, it may be considered certain that Mr. Poe has attained an"
edgarallanpoe,individual eminence in our literature which he will keep. He has given
edgarallanpoe,proof of power and originality. He has done that which could only be
edgarallanpoe,"done once with success or safety, and the imitation or repetition of"
edgarallanpoe,which would produce weariness.
edgarallanpoe,DEATH OF EDGAR A. POE
edgarallanpoe,By N. P. Willis
edgarallanpoe,"THE ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one body,"
edgarallanpoe,"equally powerful and having the complete mastery by turns-of one man,"
edgarallanpoe,"that is to say, inhabited by both a devil and an angel seems to"
edgarallanpoe,"have been realized, if all we hear is true, in the character of the"
edgarallanpoe,extraordinary man whose name we have written above. Our own impression
edgarallanpoe,"of the nature of Edgar A. Poe, differs in some important degree,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, from that which has been generally conveyed in the notices of"
edgarallanpoe,"his death. Let us, before telling what we personally know of him, copy"
edgarallanpoe,"a graphic and highly finished portraiture, from the pen of Dr. Rufus W."
edgarallanpoe,"Griswold, which appeared in a recent number of the “Tribune”:"
edgarallanpoe,"“Edgar Allen Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore on Sunday, October 7th."
edgarallanpoe,"This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it. The"
edgarallanpoe,"poet was known, personally or by reputation, in all this country; he had"
edgarallanpoe,readers in England and in several of the states of Continental Europe;
edgarallanpoe,but he had few or no friends; and the regrets for his death will be
edgarallanpoe,suggested principally by the consideration that in him literary art has
edgarallanpoe,lost one of its most brilliant but erratic stars.
edgarallanpoe,“His conversation was at times almost supramortal in its eloquence. His
edgarallanpoe,"voice was modulated with astonishing skill, and his large and variably"
edgarallanpoe,expressive eyes looked repose or shot fiery tumult into theirs who
edgarallanpoe,"listened, while his own face glowed, or was changeless in pallor, as his"
edgarallanpoe,imagination quickened his blood or drew it back frozen to his heart. His
edgarallanpoe,imagery was from the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision
edgarallanpoe,"of genius. Suddenly starting from a proposition, exactly and sharply"
edgarallanpoe,"defined, in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness, he rejected the"
edgarallanpoe,"forms of customary logic, and by a crystalline process of accretion,"
edgarallanpoe,built up his ocular demonstrations in forms of gloomiest and ghastliest
edgarallanpoe,"grandeur, or in those of the most airy and delicious beauty, so minutely"
edgarallanpoe,"and distinctly, yet so rapidly, that the attention which was yielded"
edgarallanpoe,"to him was chained till it stood among his wonderful creations, till he"
edgarallanpoe,"himself dissolved the spell, and brought his hearers back to common"
edgarallanpoe,"and base existence, by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the ignoblest"
edgarallanpoe,passion.
edgarallanpoe,"“He was at all times a dreamer dwelling in ideal realms, in heaven or"
edgarallanpoe,"hell, peopled with the creatures and the accidents of his brain. He"
edgarallanpoe,"walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips moving in"
edgarallanpoe,"indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate prayer (never for"
edgarallanpoe,"himself, for he felt, or professed to feel, that he was already damned,"
edgarallanpoe,but) for their happiness who at the moment were objects of his idolatry;
edgarallanpoe,"or with his glances introverted to a heart gnawed with anguish, and with"
edgarallanpoe,"a face shrouded in gloom, he would brave the wildest storms, and all"
edgarallanpoe,"night, with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and rains,"
edgarallanpoe,would speak as if the spirits that at such times only could be evoked by
edgarallanpoe,"him from the Aidenn, close by whose portals his disturbed soul sought to"
edgarallanpoe,forget the ills to which his constitution subjected him--close by the
edgarallanpoe,"Aidenn where were those he loved--the Aidenn which he might never see,"
edgarallanpoe,"but in fitful glimpses, as its gates opened to receive the less fiery"
edgarallanpoe,and more happy natures whose destiny to sin did not involve the doom of
edgarallanpoe,death.
edgarallanpoe,"“He seemed, except when some fitful pursuit subjugated his will and"
edgarallanpoe,"engrossed his faculties, always to bear the memory of some controlling"
edgarallanpoe,sorrow. The remarkable poem of ‘The Raven’ was probably much more nearly
edgarallanpoe,"than has been supposed, even by those who were very intimate with him, a"
edgarallanpoe,reflection and an echo of his own history. _He_ was that bird’s
edgarallanpoe,“‘Unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
edgarallanpoe,Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--
edgarallanpoe,Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
edgarallanpoe,Of ‘Never-never more.’
edgarallanpoe,"“Every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his works,"
edgarallanpoe,"whatever their design, traces of his personal character: elements of his"
edgarallanpoe,"immortal being, in which the individual survives the person. While we"
edgarallanpoe,"read the pages of the ‘Fall of the House of Usher,’ or of ‘Mesmeric"
edgarallanpoe,"Revelations,’ we see in the solemn and stately gloom which invests one,"
edgarallanpoe,"and in the subtle metaphysical analysis of both, indications of the"
edgarallanpoe,idiosyncrasies of what was most remarkable and peculiar in the author’s
edgarallanpoe,intellectual nature. But we see here only the better phases of his
edgarallanpoe,"nature, only the symbols of his juster action, for his harsh experience"
edgarallanpoe,had deprived him of all faith in man or woman. He had made up his mind
edgarallanpoe,"upon the numberless complexities of the social world, and the whole"
edgarallanpoe,system with him was an imposture. This conviction gave a direction to
edgarallanpoe,"his shrewd and naturally unamiable character. Still, though he regarded"
edgarallanpoe,"society as composed altogether of villains, the sharpness of his"
edgarallanpoe,"intellect was not of that kind which enabled him to cope with villany,"
edgarallanpoe,while it continually caused him by overshots to fail of the success of
edgarallanpoe,honesty. He was in many respects like Francis Vivian in Bulwer’s novel
edgarallanpoe,"of ‘The Caxtons.’ Passion, in him, comprehended--many of the worst"
edgarallanpoe,emotions which militate against human happiness. You could not
edgarallanpoe,"contradict him, but you raised quick choler; you could not speak of"
edgarallanpoe,"wealth, but his cheek paled with gnawing envy. The astonishing natural"
edgarallanpoe,"advantages of this poor boy--his beauty, his readiness, the daring"
edgarallanpoe,spirit that breathed around him like a fiery atmosphere--had raised his
edgarallanpoe,constitutional self-confidence into an arrogance that turned his
edgarallanpoe,"very claims to admiration into prejudices against him. Irascible,"
edgarallanpoe,"envious--bad enough, but not the worst, for these salient angles were"
edgarallanpoe,"all varnished over with a cold, repellant cynicism, his passions vented"
edgarallanpoe,"themselves in sneers. There seemed to him no moral susceptibility; and,"
edgarallanpoe,"what was more remarkable in a proud nature, little or nothing of the"
edgarallanpoe,"true point of honor. He had, to a morbid excess, that, desire to rise"
edgarallanpoe,"which is vulgarly called ambition, but no wish for the esteem or the"
edgarallanpoe,"love of his species; only the hard wish to succeed-not shine, not"
edgarallanpoe,"serve--succeed, that he might have the right to despise a world which"
edgarallanpoe,galled his self-conceit.
edgarallanpoe,“We have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes upon his
edgarallanpoe,literature. It was more conspicuous in his later than in his
edgarallanpoe,earlier writings. Nearly all that he wrote in the last two or three
edgarallanpoe,years-including much of his best poetry-was in some sense biographical;
edgarallanpoe,"in draperies of his imagination, those who had taken the trouble to"
edgarallanpoe,"trace his steps, could perceive, but slightly concealed, the figure of"
edgarallanpoe,himself.”
edgarallanpoe,"Apropos of the disparaging portion of the above well-written sketch, let"
edgarallanpoe,us truthfully say:
edgarallanpoe,"Some four or five years since, when editing a daily paper in this"
edgarallanpoe,"city, Mr. Poe was employed by us, for several months, as critic and"
edgarallanpoe,sub-editor. This was our first personal acquaintance with him. He
edgarallanpoe,"resided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles out of town,"
edgarallanpoe,"but was at his desk in the office, from nine in the morning till the"
edgarallanpoe,"evening paper went to press. With the highest admiration for his genius,"
edgarallanpoe,"and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary irregularity,"
edgarallanpoe,we were led by common report to expect a very capricious attention to
edgarallanpoe,"his duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time"
edgarallanpoe,"went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious. With"
edgarallanpoe,"his pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a reminder of what genius"
edgarallanpoe,"was in him, it was impossible, of course, not to treat him always with"
edgarallanpoe,"deferential courtesy, and, to our occasional request that he would not"
edgarallanpoe,"probe too deep in a criticism, or that he would erase a passage colored"
edgarallanpoe,"too highly with his resentments against society and mankind, he readily"
edgarallanpoe,"and courteously assented-far more yielding than most men, we thought,"
edgarallanpoe,on points so excusably sensitive. With a prospect of taking the lead in
edgarallanpoe,"another periodical, he, at last, voluntarily gave up his employment"
edgarallanpoe,"with us, and, through all this considerable period, we had seen but"
edgarallanpoe,"one presentment of the man-a quiet, patient, industrious, and most"
edgarallanpoe,"gentlemanly person, commanding the utmost respect and good feeling by"
edgarallanpoe,his unvarying deportment and ability.
edgarallanpoe,"Residing as he did in the country, we never met Mr. Poe in hours of"
edgarallanpoe,leisure; but he frequently called on us afterward at our place of
edgarallanpoe,"business, and we met him often in the street-invariably the same sad"
edgarallanpoe,"mannered, winning and refined gentleman, such as we had always known"
edgarallanpoe,"him. It was by rumor only, up to the day of his death, that we knew of"
edgarallanpoe,"any other development of manner or character. We heard, from one who"
edgarallanpoe,knew him well (what should be stated in all mention of his lamentable
edgarallanpoe,"irregularities), that, with a single glass of wine, his whole nature"
edgarallanpoe,"was reversed, the demon became uppermost, and, though none of the"
edgarallanpoe,"usual signs of intoxication were visible, his will was palpably insane."
edgarallanpoe,"Possessing his reasoning faculties in excited activity, at such times,"
edgarallanpoe,"and seeking his acquaintances with his wonted look and memory, he easily"
edgarallanpoe,"seemed personating only another phase of his natural character, and was"
edgarallanpoe,"accused, accordingly, of insulting arrogance and bad-heartedness. In"
edgarallanpoe,"this reversed character, we repeat, it was never our chance to see him."
edgarallanpoe,"We know it from hearsay, and we mention it in connection with this sad"
edgarallanpoe,infirmity of physical constitution; which puts it upon very nearly the
edgarallanpoe,ground of a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity.
edgarallanpoe,"The arrogance, vanity, and depravity of heart, of which Mr. Poe was"
edgarallanpoe,"generally accused, seem to us referable altogether to this reversed"
edgarallanpoe,phase of his character. Under that degree of intoxication which only
edgarallanpoe,"acted upon him by demonizing his sense of truth and right, he doubtless"
edgarallanpoe,said and did much that was wholly irreconcilable with his better nature;
edgarallanpoe,"but, when himself, and as we knew him only, his modesty and unaffected"
edgarallanpoe,"humility, as to his own deservings, were a constant charm to his"
edgarallanpoe,"character. His letters, of which the constant application for autographs"
edgarallanpoe,"has taken from us, we are sorry to confess, the greater portion,"
edgarallanpoe,exhibited this quality very strongly. In one of the carelessly written
edgarallanpoe,"notes of which we chance still to retain possession, for instance, he"
edgarallanpoe,speaks of “The Raven”--that extraordinary poem which electrified the
edgarallanpoe,"world of imaginative readers, and has become the type of a school of"
edgarallanpoe,"poetry of its own-and, in evident earnest, attributes its success to"
edgarallanpoe,the few words of commendation with which we had prefaced it in this
edgarallanpoe,paper.--It will throw light on his sane character to give a literal copy
edgarallanpoe,of the note:
edgarallanpoe,"“FORDHAM, April 20, 1849"
edgarallanpoe,"“My DEAR WILLIS--The poem which I inclose, and which I am so vain as to"
edgarallanpoe,"hope you will like, in some respects, has been just published in a paper"
edgarallanpoe,"for which sheer necessity compels me to write, now and then. It pays"
edgarallanpoe,well as times go-but unquestionably it ought to pay ten prices; for
edgarallanpoe,whatever I send it I feel I am consigning to the tomb of the Capulets.
edgarallanpoe,"The verses accompanying this, may I beg you to take out of the tomb, and"
edgarallanpoe,bring them to light in the ‘Home journal?’ If you can oblige me so far
edgarallanpoe,"as to copy them, I do not think it will be necessary to say ‘From the"
edgarallanpoe,"----, that would be too bad; and, perhaps, ‘From a late ---- paper,’"
edgarallanpoe,would do.
edgarallanpoe,“I have not forgotten how a ‘good word in season’ from you made ‘The
edgarallanpoe,"Raven,’ and made ‘Ulalume’ (which by-the-way, people have done me the"
edgarallanpoe,"honor of attributing to you), therefore, I would ask you (if I dared) to"
edgarallanpoe,say something of these lines if they please you.
edgarallanpoe,"“Truly yours ever,"
edgarallanpoe,“EDGAR A. POE.”
edgarallanpoe,"In double proof of his earnest disposition to do the best for himself,"
edgarallanpoe,"and of the trustful and grateful nature which has been denied him, we"
edgarallanpoe,give another of the only three of his notes which we chance to retain:
edgarallanpoe,"“FORDHAM, January 22, 1848."
edgarallanpoe,“My DEAR MR. WILLIS--I am about to make an effort at re-establishing
edgarallanpoe,"myself in the literary world, and _feel _that I may depend upon your"
edgarallanpoe,aid.
edgarallanpoe,"“My general aim is to start a Magazine, to be called ‘The Stylus,’ but"
edgarallanpoe,"it would be useless to me, even when established, if not entirely out of"
edgarallanpoe,"the control of a publisher. I mean, therefore, to get up a journal which"
edgarallanpoe,"shall be _my own_ at all points. With this end in view, I must get a"
edgarallanpoe,list of at least five hundred subscribers to begin with; nearly two
edgarallanpoe,"hundred I have already. I propose, however, to go South and West,"
edgarallanpoe,among my personal and literary friends--old college and West Point
edgarallanpoe,acquaintances--and see what I can do. In order to get the means of
edgarallanpoe,"taking the first step, I propose to lecture at the Society Library,"
edgarallanpoe,"on Thursday, the 3d of February, and, that there may be no cause of"
edgarallanpoe,"_squabbling_, my subject shall _not be literary _at all. I have chosen a"
edgarallanpoe,broad text: ‘The Universe.’
edgarallanpoe,"“Having thus given you _the facts_ of the case, I leave all the rest"
edgarallanpoe,"to the suggestions of your own tact and generosity. Gratefully, _most"
edgarallanpoe,"gratefully,_"
edgarallanpoe,"_“Your friend always,_"
edgarallanpoe,_“EDGAR A. POE._”
edgarallanpoe,"Brief and chance-taken as these letters are, we think they sufficiently"
edgarallanpoe,"prove the existence of the very qualities denied to Mr. Poe-humility,"
edgarallanpoe,"willingness to persevere, belief in another’s friendship, and capability"
edgarallanpoe,of cordial and grateful friendship! Such he assuredly was when sane.
edgarallanpoe,"Such only he has invariably seemed to us, in all we have happened"
edgarallanpoe,"personally to know of him, through a friendship of five or six years."
edgarallanpoe,"And so much easier is it to believe what we have seen and known, than"
edgarallanpoe,"what we hear of only, that we remember him but with admiration and"
edgarallanpoe,"respect; these descriptions of him, when morally insane, seeming to"
edgarallanpoe,"us like portraits, painted in sickness, of a man we have only known in"
edgarallanpoe,health.
edgarallanpoe,"But there is another, more touching, and far more forcible evidence that"
edgarallanpoe,there was _goodness _in Edgar A. Poe. To reveal it we are obliged to
edgarallanpoe,venture upon the lifting of the veil which sacredly covers grief and
edgarallanpoe,"refinement in poverty; but we think it may be excused, if so we can"
edgarallanpoe,"brighten the memory of the poet, even were there not a more needed and"
edgarallanpoe,immediate service which it may render to the nearest link broken by his
edgarallanpoe,death.
edgarallanpoe,Our first knowledge of Mr. Poe’s removal to this city was by a call
edgarallanpoe,which we received from a lady who introduced herself to us as the mother
edgarallanpoe,"of his wife. She was in search of employment for him, and she excused"
edgarallanpoe,"her errand by mentioning that he was ill, that her daughter was a"
edgarallanpoe,"confirmed invalid, and that their circumstances were such as compelled"
edgarallanpoe,"her taking it upon herself. The countenance of this lady, made beautiful"
edgarallanpoe,and saintly with an evidently complete giving up of her life to
edgarallanpoe,"privation and sorrowful tenderness, her gentle and mournful voice urging"
edgarallanpoe,"its plea, her long-forgotten but habitually and unconsciously refined"
edgarallanpoe,"manners, and her appealing and yet appreciative mention of the claims"
edgarallanpoe,"and abilities of her son, disclosed at once the presence of one of those"
edgarallanpoe,angels upon earth that women in adversity can be. It was a hard fate
edgarallanpoe,"that she was watching over. Mr. Poe wrote with fastidious difficulty,"
edgarallanpoe,and in a style too much above the popular level to be well paid. He was
edgarallanpoe,"always in pecuniary difficulty, and, with his sick wife, frequently in"
edgarallanpoe,"want of the merest necessaries of life. Winter after winter, for"
edgarallanpoe,"years, the most touching sight to us, in this whole city, has been that"
edgarallanpoe,"tireless minister to genius, thinly and insufficiently clad, going from"
edgarallanpoe,"office to office with a poem, or an article on some literary subject, to"
edgarallanpoe,"sell, sometimes simply pleading in a broken voice that he was ill, and"
edgarallanpoe,"begging for him, mentioning nothing but that “he was ill,” whatever"
edgarallanpoe,"might be the reason for his writing nothing, and never, amid all her"
edgarallanpoe,"tears and recitals of distress, suffering one syllable to escape her"
edgarallanpoe,"lips that could convey a doubt of him, or a complaint, or a lessening of"
edgarallanpoe,pride in his genius and good intentions. Her daughter died a year and
edgarallanpoe,"a half since, but she did not desert him. She continued his ministering"
edgarallanpoe,"angel--living with him, caring for him, guarding him against exposure,"
edgarallanpoe,"and when he was carried away by temptation, amid grief and the"
edgarallanpoe,"loneliness of feelings unreplied to, and awoke from his self abandonment"
edgarallanpoe,"prostrated in destitution and suffering, _begging _for him still. If"
edgarallanpoe,"woman’s devotion, born with a first love, and fed with human passion,"
edgarallanpoe,"hallow its object, as it is allowed to do, what does not a devotion"
edgarallanpoe,"like this-pure, disinterested and holy as the watch of an invisible"
edgarallanpoe,spirit-say for him who inspired it?
edgarallanpoe,"We have a letter before us, written by this lady, Mrs. Clemm, on the"
edgarallanpoe,morning in which she heard of the death of this object of her untiring
edgarallanpoe,"care. It is merely a request that we would call upon her, but we will"
edgarallanpoe,copy a few of its words--sacred as its privacy is--to warrant the truth
edgarallanpoe,"of the picture we have drawn above, and add force to the appeal we wish"
edgarallanpoe,to make for her:
edgarallanpoe,“I have this morning heard of the death of my darling Eddie.... Can you
edgarallanpoe,give me any circumstances or particulars?... Oh! do not desert your
edgarallanpoe,"poor friend in his bitter affliction!... Ask Mr. ---- to come, as I must"
edgarallanpoe,deliver a message to him from my poor Eddie.... I need not ask you to
edgarallanpoe,notice his death and to speak well of him. I know you will. But say what
edgarallanpoe,"an affectionate son he was to me, his poor desolate mother...”"
edgarallanpoe,"To hedge round a grave with respect, what choice is there, between the"
edgarallanpoe,"relinquished wealth and honors of the world, and the story of such a"
edgarallanpoe,"woman’s unrewarded devotion! Risking what we do, in delicacy, by making"
edgarallanpoe,"it public, we feel--other reasons aside--that it betters the world to"
edgarallanpoe,make known that there are such ministrations to its erring and gifted.
edgarallanpoe,What we have said will speak to some hearts. There are those who will
edgarallanpoe,"be glad to know how the lamp, whose light of poetry has beamed on their"
edgarallanpoe,"far-away recognition, was watched over with care and pain, that they"
edgarallanpoe,"may send to her, who is more darkened than they by its extinction, some"
edgarallanpoe,"token of their sympathy. She is destitute and alone. If any, far or"
edgarallanpoe,"near, will send to us what may aid and cheer her through the remainder"
edgarallanpoe,"of her life, we will joyfully place it in her hands."
edgarallanpoe,THE UNPARALLELED ADVENTURES OF ONE HANS PFAALL (*1)
edgarallanpoe,"BY late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high state"
edgarallanpoe,"of philosophical excitement. Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of"
edgarallanpoe,a nature so completely unexpected--so entirely novel--so utterly at
edgarallanpoe,variance with preconceived opinions--as to leave no doubt on my mind
edgarallanpoe,"that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment,"
edgarallanpoe,all reason and astronomy together by the ears.
edgarallanpoe,It appears that on the---- day of---- (I am not positive about the
edgarallanpoe,"date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically"
edgarallanpoe,"mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in the"
edgarallanpoe,well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was warm--unusually so for
edgarallanpoe,the season--there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and the multitude
edgarallanpoe,were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly
edgarallanpoe,"showers of momentary duration, that fell from large white masses"
edgarallanpoe,of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the
edgarallanpoe,"firmament. Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation"
edgarallanpoe,became apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues
edgarallanpoe,"succeeded; and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were"
edgarallanpoe,"upturned toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously"
edgarallanpoe,"from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be"
edgarallanpoe,"compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long, loudly,"
edgarallanpoe,"and furiously, through all the environs of Rotterdam."
edgarallanpoe,The origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From behind
edgarallanpoe,the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of cloud already
edgarallanpoe,"mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space, a"
edgarallanpoe,"queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid substance, so oddly shaped,"
edgarallanpoe,"so whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner comprehended,"
edgarallanpoe,"and never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who"
edgarallanpoe,stood open-mouthed below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows
edgarallanpoe,"and devils in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no"
edgarallanpoe,one could imagine; no one--not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von
edgarallanpoe,"Underduk--had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so, as"
edgarallanpoe,"nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man replaced his"
edgarallanpoe,"pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking up his right"
edgarallanpoe,"eye towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted"
edgarallanpoe,"significantly--then waddled back, grunted, paused, and finally--puffed"
edgarallanpoe,again.
edgarallanpoe,"In the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly city,"
edgarallanpoe,"came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke. In"
edgarallanpoe,a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned. It
edgarallanpoe,appeared to be--yes! it was undoubtedly a species of balloon; but surely
edgarallanpoe,"no such balloon had ever been seen in Rotterdam before. For who, let me"
edgarallanpoe,"ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers?"
edgarallanpoe,"No man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the"
edgarallanpoe,"people, or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical"
edgarallanpoe,"thing in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of"
edgarallanpoe,the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for
edgarallanpoe,a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the
edgarallanpoe,"burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even"
edgarallanpoe,still more reprehensible. Being little or nothing better than a huge
edgarallanpoe,foolscap turned upside down. And this similitude was regarded as by no
edgarallanpoe,"means lessened when, upon nearer inspection, there was perceived a large"
edgarallanpoe,"tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the"
edgarallanpoe,"cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept"
edgarallanpoe,up a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse.
edgarallanpoe,"Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine,"
edgarallanpoe,"there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver hat, with a brim"
edgarallanpoe,"superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a"
edgarallanpoe,"silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens"
edgarallanpoe,of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and
edgarallanpoe,indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity;
edgarallanpoe,"while the vrow Grettel Pfaall, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation"
edgarallanpoe,"of joyful surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good"
edgarallanpoe,"man himself. Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as"
edgarallanpoe,"Pfaall, with three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam"
edgarallanpoe,"about five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and"
edgarallanpoe,up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining
edgarallanpoe,"any intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be sure, some bones"
edgarallanpoe,"which were thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking"
edgarallanpoe,"rubbish, had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east"
edgarallanpoe,"of Rotterdam, and some people went so far as to imagine that in this"
edgarallanpoe,"spot a foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in"
edgarallanpoe,all probability Hans Pfaall and his associates. But to return.
edgarallanpoe,The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within
edgarallanpoe,"a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently"
edgarallanpoe,distinct view of the person of its occupant. This was in truth a very
edgarallanpoe,droll little somebody. He could not have been more than two feet in
edgarallanpoe,"height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient"
edgarallanpoe,"to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny"
edgarallanpoe,"car, but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as"
edgarallanpoe,"the breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon. The body of the"
edgarallanpoe,"little man was more than proportionately broad, giving to his entire"
edgarallanpoe,"figure a rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen"
edgarallanpoe,"at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally"
edgarallanpoe,"protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more"
edgarallanpoe,"properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were enormously large. His"
edgarallanpoe,"hair was extremely gray, and collected in a cue behind. His nose was"
edgarallanpoe,"prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant,"
edgarallanpoe,"and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad,"
edgarallanpoe,"puffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a"
edgarallanpoe,semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd little
edgarallanpoe,"gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight"
edgarallanpoe,"breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees. His vest"
edgarallanpoe,was of some bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily
edgarallanpoe,"on one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red"
edgarallanpoe,"silk handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty"
edgarallanpoe,"manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent"
edgarallanpoe,dimensions.
edgarallanpoe,"Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the"
edgarallanpoe,"surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized"
edgarallanpoe,"with a fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined to make any nearer"
edgarallanpoe,"approach to terra firma. Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand"
edgarallanpoe,"from a canvas bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became"
edgarallanpoe,"stationary in an instant. He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated"
edgarallanpoe,"manner, to extract from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco"
edgarallanpoe,"pocket-book. This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with"
edgarallanpoe,"an air of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight."
edgarallanpoe,"He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with"
edgarallanpoe,"red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely"
edgarallanpoe,"at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von Underduk. His Excellency"
edgarallanpoe,"stooped to take it up. But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and"
edgarallanpoe,"having apparently no farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began"
edgarallanpoe,at this moment to make busy preparations for departure; and it being
edgarallanpoe,"necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend,"
edgarallanpoe,"the half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without"
edgarallanpoe,"taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of them,"
edgarallanpoe,"most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled him over"
edgarallanpoe,"and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every man in"
edgarallanpoe,"Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed, however, that the great Underduk"
edgarallanpoe,suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off
edgarallanpoe,"with impunity. It is said, on the contrary, that during each and every"
edgarallanpoe,one of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than
edgarallanpoe,"one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which he"
edgarallanpoe,"held fast the whole time with all his might, and to which he intends"
edgarallanpoe,holding fast until the day of his death.
edgarallanpoe,"In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away"
edgarallanpoe,"above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that"
edgarallanpoe,"from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever to the"
edgarallanpoe,wondering eyes of the good citizens of Rotterdam. All attention was
edgarallanpoe,"now directed to the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences"
edgarallanpoe,"attending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and"
edgarallanpoe,"personal dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer"
edgarallanpoe,"Superbus Von Underduk. That functionary, however, had not failed, during"
edgarallanpoe,"his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important"
edgarallanpoe,"subject of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon"
edgarallanpoe,"inspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands, being actually"
edgarallanpoe,"addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in their official"
edgarallanpoe,capacities of President and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of
edgarallanpoe,Astronomy. It was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the
edgarallanpoe,"spot, and found to contain the following extraordinary, and indeed very"
edgarallanpoe,"serious, communications."
edgarallanpoe,"To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and"
edgarallanpoe,"Vice-President of the States’ College of Astronomers, in the city of"
edgarallanpoe,Rotterdam.
edgarallanpoe,"“Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by"
edgarallanpoe,"name Hans Pfaall, and by occupation a mender of bellows, who, with three"
edgarallanpoe,"others, disappeared from Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner"
edgarallanpoe,"which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden, and"
edgarallanpoe,"extremely unaccountable. If, however, it so please your Excellencies, I,"
edgarallanpoe,"the writer of this communication, am the identical Hans Pfaall himself."
edgarallanpoe,"It is well known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of"
edgarallanpoe,"forty years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at"
edgarallanpoe,"the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time"
edgarallanpoe,of my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided therein time out of
edgarallanpoe,"mind--they, as well as myself, steadily following the respectable and"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows. For, to speak the"
edgarallanpoe,"truth, until of late years, that the heads of all the people have been"
edgarallanpoe,"set agog with politics, no better business than my own could an"
edgarallanpoe,"honest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good,"
edgarallanpoe,"employment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack of"
edgarallanpoe,"either money or good-will. But, as I was saying, we soon began to feel"
edgarallanpoe,"the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that"
edgarallanpoe,"sort of thing. People who were formerly, the very best customers in the"
edgarallanpoe,"world, had now not a moment of time to think of us at all. They had, so"
edgarallanpoe,"they said, as much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and"
edgarallanpoe,keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire
edgarallanpoe,"wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the"
edgarallanpoe,"government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired"
edgarallanpoe,"durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was not a"
edgarallanpoe,pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or
edgarallanpoe,required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state of things not
edgarallanpoe,"to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and"
edgarallanpoe,"children to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and I"
edgarallanpoe,spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of
edgarallanpoe,"putting an end to my life. Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure"
edgarallanpoe,for contemplation. My house was literally besieged from morning till
edgarallanpoe,"night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged"
edgarallanpoe,tiger against the bars of his enclosure. There were three fellows in
edgarallanpoe,"particular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually"
edgarallanpoe,"about my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I"
edgarallanpoe,"internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as"
edgarallanpoe,to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but
edgarallanpoe,the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan
edgarallanpoe,"of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing my brains out with a"
edgarallanpoe,"blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to"
edgarallanpoe,"treat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of"
edgarallanpoe,"fate, an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me."
edgarallanpoe,"“One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more than"
edgarallanpoe,"usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about the most"
edgarallanpoe,"obscure streets without object whatever, until at length I chanced to"
edgarallanpoe,stumble against the corner of a bookseller’s stall. Seeing a chair close
edgarallanpoe,"at hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, hardly knowing why, opened the pages of the first volume which"
edgarallanpoe,came within my reach. It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on
edgarallanpoe,"Speculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or"
edgarallanpoe,by a Frenchman of somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of
edgarallanpoe,"information on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more"
edgarallanpoe,"absorbed in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice"
edgarallanpoe,before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me. By this
edgarallanpoe,"time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home. But"
edgarallanpoe,"the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I"
edgarallanpoe,"sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved carefully over in my"
edgarallanpoe,memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer.
edgarallanpoe,There are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a
edgarallanpoe,powerful and extraordinary manner. The longer I meditated upon these
edgarallanpoe,the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me.
edgarallanpoe,"The limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my"
edgarallanpoe,"ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from"
edgarallanpoe,"rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read,"
edgarallanpoe,or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in
edgarallanpoe,"consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I"
edgarallanpoe,"was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether"
edgarallanpoe,"those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the"
edgarallanpoe,"appearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality,"
edgarallanpoe,"and other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to"
edgarallanpoe,"proceed a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a"
edgarallanpoe,"purely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity"
edgarallanpoe,"and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth,"
edgarallanpoe,"is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases,"
edgarallanpoe,"the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual"
edgarallanpoe,situations wherein she may be found. Nature herself seemed to afford
edgarallanpoe,me corroboration of these ideas. In the contemplation of the heavenly
edgarallanpoe,bodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish a star with
edgarallanpoe,"nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and"
edgarallanpoe,"undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance in"
edgarallanpoe,"its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware that this"
edgarallanpoe,apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being
edgarallanpoe,less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior
edgarallanpoe,"portions of the retina. This knowledge, and some of another kind, came"
edgarallanpoe,"afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I"
edgarallanpoe,"have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and"
edgarallanpoe,forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the
edgarallanpoe,"epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star"
edgarallanpoe,"offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force"
edgarallanpoe,"of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the"
edgarallanpoe,course which I afterwards pursued.
edgarallanpoe,"“It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed. My"
edgarallanpoe,"mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night"
edgarallanpoe,"buried in meditation. Arising early in the morning, and contriving"
edgarallanpoe,"again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired eagerly to the"
edgarallanpoe,"bookseller’s stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed,"
edgarallanpoe,in the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy.
edgarallanpoe,"Having arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment"
edgarallanpoe,"to their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this"
edgarallanpoe,nature as I thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the
edgarallanpoe,"intervals of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the"
edgarallanpoe,three creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally
edgarallanpoe,succeeded--partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy
edgarallanpoe,"a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance"
edgarallanpoe,"upon completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and"
edgarallanpoe,for assistance in which I solicited their services. By these means--for
edgarallanpoe,they were ignorant men--I found little difficulty in gaining them over
edgarallanpoe,to my purpose.
edgarallanpoe,"“Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife and"
edgarallanpoe,"with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had"
edgarallanpoe,"remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences,"
edgarallanpoe,"and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no"
edgarallanpoe,inconsiderable quantity of ready money. With the means thus accruing I
edgarallanpoe,"proceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces"
edgarallanpoe,of twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a
edgarallanpoe,"large and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other"
edgarallanpoe,articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of
edgarallanpoe,extraordinary dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as
edgarallanpoe,"possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular"
edgarallanpoe,method of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the twine into
edgarallanpoe,a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the
edgarallanpoe,"necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common"
edgarallanpoe,"barometer with some important modifications, and two astronomical"
edgarallanpoe,instruments not so generally known. I then took opportunities of
edgarallanpoe,"conveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five"
edgarallanpoe,"iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a"
edgarallanpoe,"larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly"
edgarallanpoe,"shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic"
edgarallanpoe,"substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns"
edgarallanpoe,of a very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter materials
edgarallanpoe,is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself--or at
edgarallanpoe,least never applied to any similar purpose. The secret I would make no
edgarallanpoe,"difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of"
edgarallanpoe,"Nantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself."
edgarallanpoe,"The same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my"
edgarallanpoe,"intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a"
edgarallanpoe,"certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an"
edgarallanpoe,"impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was"
edgarallanpoe,"not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of"
edgarallanpoe,"gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention this circumstance,"
edgarallanpoe,because I think it probable that hereafter the individual in question
edgarallanpoe,may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have
edgarallanpoe,"spoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very"
edgarallanpoe,singular invention.
edgarallanpoe,“On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy
edgarallanpoe,"respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a hole"
edgarallanpoe,two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five
edgarallanpoe,"feet in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being the station"
edgarallanpoe,"designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth. In"
edgarallanpoe,"each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing"
edgarallanpoe,"fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty"
edgarallanpoe,"pounds, of cannon powder. These--the keg and canisters--I connected in"
edgarallanpoe,a proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the
edgarallanpoe,"canisters the end of about four feet of slow match, I covered up the"
edgarallanpoe,"hole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match"
edgarallanpoe,"protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then"
edgarallanpoe,"filled up the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their"
edgarallanpoe,destined situation.
edgarallanpoe,"“Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot, and"
edgarallanpoe,"there secreted, one of M. Grimm’s improvements upon the apparatus for"
edgarallanpoe,"condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this machine, however,"
edgarallanpoe,to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the
edgarallanpoe,"purposes to which I intended making it applicable. But, with severe"
edgarallanpoe,"labor and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success"
edgarallanpoe,in all my preparations. My balloon was soon completed. It would contain
edgarallanpoe,"more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I"
edgarallanpoe,"calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with"
edgarallanpoe,one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain. It
edgarallanpoe,"had received three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to"
edgarallanpoe,"answer all the purposes of silk itself, quite as strong and a good deal"
edgarallanpoe,less expensive.
edgarallanpoe,"“Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy"
edgarallanpoe,in relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the
edgarallanpoe,"bookseller’s stall; and promising, on my part, to return as soon as"
edgarallanpoe,"circumstances would permit, I gave her what little money I had left,"
edgarallanpoe,and bade her farewell. Indeed I had no fear on her account. She was
edgarallanpoe,"what people call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world"
edgarallanpoe,"without my assistance. I believe, to tell the truth, she always looked"
edgarallanpoe,"upon me as an idle boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but"
edgarallanpoe,"building castles in the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me."
edgarallanpoe,"It was a dark night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as"
edgarallanpoe,"aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much trouble,"
edgarallanpoe,"we carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout"
edgarallanpoe,"way, to the station where the other articles were deposited. We there"
edgarallanpoe,"found them all unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to business."
edgarallanpoe,"“It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was dark; there"
edgarallanpoe,"was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals,"
edgarallanpoe,rendered us very uncomfortable. But my chief anxiety was concerning
edgarallanpoe,"the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended,"
edgarallanpoe,began to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable
edgarallanpoe,"to damage. I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence,"
edgarallanpoe,"pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the"
edgarallanpoe,"others. They did not cease, however, importuning me with questions as"
edgarallanpoe,"to what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and expressed much"
edgarallanpoe,dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo. They could
edgarallanpoe,"not perceive, so they said, what good was likely to result from"
edgarallanpoe,"their getting wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible"
edgarallanpoe,"incantations. I began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might,"
edgarallanpoe,for I verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a
edgarallanpoe,"compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was"
edgarallanpoe,"nothing better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of"
edgarallanpoe,"their leaving me altogether. I contrived, however, to pacify them by"
edgarallanpoe,"promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could bring"
edgarallanpoe,"the present business to a termination. To these speeches they gave, of"
edgarallanpoe,"course, their own interpretation; fancying, no doubt, that at all events"
edgarallanpoe,I should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money; and
edgarallanpoe,"provided I paid them all I owed, and a trifle more, in consideration of"
edgarallanpoe,"their services, I dare say they cared very little what became of either"
edgarallanpoe,my soul or my carcass.
edgarallanpoe,“In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently
edgarallanpoe,"inflated. I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements in"
edgarallanpoe,"it--not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water,"
edgarallanpoe,"and a large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much"
edgarallanpoe,nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk. I also secured in
edgarallanpoe,"the car a pair of pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I"
edgarallanpoe,thought it high time to take my departure. Dropping a lighted cigar on
edgarallanpoe,"the ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to"
edgarallanpoe,"pick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose end,"
edgarallanpoe,"as I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of"
edgarallanpoe,the smaller casks. This manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of
edgarallanpoe,"the three duns; and, jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single"
edgarallanpoe,"cord which held me to the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot"
edgarallanpoe,"upward, carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of"
edgarallanpoe,"leaden ballast, and able to have carried up as many more."
edgarallanpoe,"“Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards, when,"
edgarallanpoe,roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous
edgarallanpoe,"manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke, and sulphur, and"
edgarallanpoe,"legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, that"
edgarallanpoe,"my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car,"
edgarallanpoe,"trembling with unmitigated terror. Indeed, I now perceived that I had"
edgarallanpoe,"entirely overdone the business, and that the main consequences of the"
edgarallanpoe,"shock were yet to be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second,"
edgarallanpoe,"I felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately"
edgarallanpoe,"thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly"
edgarallanpoe,through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. When
edgarallanpoe,"I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the"
edgarallanpoe,"extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its proper"
edgarallanpoe,"cause--my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest"
edgarallanpoe,"power. But at the time, I thought only of preserving my life. The"
edgarallanpoe,"balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round"
edgarallanpoe,"and round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering"
edgarallanpoe,"like a drunken man, hurled me with great force over the rim of the car,"
edgarallanpoe,"and left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and"
edgarallanpoe,"my face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in"
edgarallanpoe,"length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of"
edgarallanpoe,"the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most"
edgarallanpoe,providentially entangled. It is impossible--utterly impossible--to form
edgarallanpoe,any adequate idea of the horror of my situation. I gasped convulsively
edgarallanpoe,for breath--a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve
edgarallanpoe,and muscle of my frame--I felt my eyes starting from their sockets--a
edgarallanpoe,horrible nausea overwhelmed me--and at length I fainted away.
edgarallanpoe,"“How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It must,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially"
edgarallanpoe,"recovered the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon"
edgarallanpoe,"at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace"
edgarallanpoe,of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast
edgarallanpoe,"horizon. My sensations, however, upon thus recovering, were by no means"
edgarallanpoe,"so rife with agony as might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was"
edgarallanpoe,much of incipient madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my
edgarallanpoe,"situation. I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other,"
edgarallanpoe,and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of
edgarallanpoe,"the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingernails. I afterward"
edgarallanpoe,"carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with"
edgarallanpoe,"minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was"
edgarallanpoe,"not, as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon. Then,"
edgarallanpoe,"in a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing"
edgarallanpoe,"therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to account"
edgarallanpoe,"for their disappearance, and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly"
edgarallanpoe,chagrined. It now occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the
edgarallanpoe,"joint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to"
edgarallanpoe,"glimmer through my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither astonished"
edgarallanpoe,"nor horror-stricken. If I felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of"
edgarallanpoe,chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in
edgarallanpoe,"extricating myself from this dilemma; and I never, for a moment, looked"
edgarallanpoe,upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt. For a few
edgarallanpoe,minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation. I have a
edgarallanpoe,"distinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips, putting"
edgarallanpoe,"my forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of other"
edgarallanpoe,"gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their"
edgarallanpoe,"arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance. Having,"
edgarallanpoe,"as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution"
edgarallanpoe,"and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the large"
edgarallanpoe,iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles. This
edgarallanpoe,"buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with great"
edgarallanpoe,"difficulty on their axis. I brought them, however, after some trouble,"
edgarallanpoe,"at right angles to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find them"
edgarallanpoe,remain firm in that position. Holding the instrument thus obtained
edgarallanpoe,"within my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had"
edgarallanpoe,"to rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it"
edgarallanpoe,was at length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made fast
edgarallanpoe,"the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly"
edgarallanpoe,"around my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious exertion"
edgarallanpoe,"of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing"
edgarallanpoe,"the buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the"
edgarallanpoe,circular rim of the wicker-work.
edgarallanpoe,"“My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle"
edgarallanpoe,of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was
edgarallanpoe,therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular. So far from
edgarallanpoe,"it, I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the"
edgarallanpoe,"change of situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the"
edgarallanpoe,"car considerably outwards from my position, which was accordingly one"
edgarallanpoe,"of the most imminent and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"that when I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen"
edgarallanpoe,"with my face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from"
edgarallanpoe,"it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by which"
edgarallanpoe,"I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge, instead of"
edgarallanpoe,"through a crevice near the bottom of the car,--I say it may be readily"
edgarallanpoe,"conceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I should have been"
edgarallanpoe,"unable to accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the"
edgarallanpoe,wonderful adventures of Hans Pfaall would have been utterly lost to
edgarallanpoe,"posterity, I had therefore every reason to be grateful; although, in"
edgarallanpoe,"point of fact, I was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung"
edgarallanpoe,"for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner, without"
edgarallanpoe,"making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly"
edgarallanpoe,tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not fail to
edgarallanpoe,"die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a"
edgarallanpoe,"chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. In fact, the blood so"
edgarallanpoe,"long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had"
edgarallanpoe,"hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium, had now begun"
edgarallanpoe,"to retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness which was"
edgarallanpoe,"thus added to my perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me"
edgarallanpoe,of the self-possession and courage to encounter it. But this weakness
edgarallanpoe,"was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came to my"
edgarallanpoe,"rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I"
edgarallanpoe,"jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length, clutching with a vise-like"
edgarallanpoe,"grip the long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell"
edgarallanpoe,headlong and shuddering within the car.
edgarallanpoe,“It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself
edgarallanpoe,"sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I then,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my great relief,"
edgarallanpoe,"uninjured. My implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost"
edgarallanpoe,"neither ballast nor provisions. Indeed, I had so well secured them in"
edgarallanpoe,"their places, that such an accident was entirely out of the question."
edgarallanpoe,"Looking at my watch, I found it six o’clock. I was still rapidly"
edgarallanpoe,"ascending, and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and"
edgarallanpoe,"three-quarter miles. Immediately beneath me in the ocean, lay a small"
edgarallanpoe,"black object, slightly oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and"
edgarallanpoe,in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish
edgarallanpoe,"toys called a domino. Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly"
edgarallanpoe,"discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and"
edgarallanpoe,pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W. Besides this
edgarallanpoe,"ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun, which had"
edgarallanpoe,long arisen.
edgarallanpoe,“It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies the
edgarallanpoe,object of my perilous voyage. Your Excellencies will bear in mind that
edgarallanpoe,distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length driven me to the
edgarallanpoe,"resolution of committing suicide. It was not, however, that to life"
edgarallanpoe,"itself I had any, positive disgust, but that I was harassed beyond"
edgarallanpoe,endurance by the adventitious miseries attending my situation. In this
edgarallanpoe,"state of mind, wishing to live, yet wearied with life, the treatise at"
edgarallanpoe,the stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination. I then
edgarallanpoe,"finally made up my mind. I determined to depart, yet live--to leave the"
edgarallanpoe,"world, yet continue to exist--in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let"
edgarallanpoe,"what would ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon. Now, lest"
edgarallanpoe,"I should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will detail,"
edgarallanpoe,"as well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that"
edgarallanpoe,"an achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and"
edgarallanpoe,"incontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit,"
edgarallanpoe,beyond the confines of the possible.
edgarallanpoe,“The moon’s actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be
edgarallanpoe,"attended to. Now, the mean or average interval between the centres of"
edgarallanpoe,"the two planets is 59.9643 of the earth’s equatorial radii, or only"
edgarallanpoe,"about 237,000 miles. I say the mean or average interval. But it must"
edgarallanpoe,be borne in mind that the form of the moon’s orbit being an ellipse of
edgarallanpoe,eccentricity amounting to no less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of
edgarallanpoe,"the ellipse itself, and the earth’s centre being situated in its focus,"
edgarallanpoe,"if I could, in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its"
edgarallanpoe,"perigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished."
edgarallanpoe,"But, to say nothing at present of this possibility, it was very certain"
edgarallanpoe,"that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the"
edgarallanpoe,"radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say 1080,"
edgarallanpoe,"in all 5,080, leaving an actual interval to be traversed, under average"
edgarallanpoe,"circumstances, of 231,920 miles. Now this, I reflected, was no"
edgarallanpoe,very extraordinary distance. Travelling on land has been repeatedly
edgarallanpoe,"accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much"
edgarallanpoe,"greater speed may be anticipated. But even at this velocity, it would"
edgarallanpoe,take me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon. There
edgarallanpoe,"were, however, many particulars inducing me to believe that my average"
edgarallanpoe,rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles
edgarallanpoe,"per hour, and, as these considerations did not fail to make a deep"
edgarallanpoe,"impression upon my mind, I will mention them more fully hereafter."
edgarallanpoe,“The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance.
edgarallanpoe,"From indications afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions"
edgarallanpoe,"from the surface of the earth we have, at the height of 1,000 feet, left"
edgarallanpoe,"below us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that"
edgarallanpoe,"at 10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000,"
edgarallanpoe,"which is not far from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted"
edgarallanpoe,"one-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable,"
edgarallanpoe,body of air incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an
edgarallanpoe,altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth’s diameter--that
edgarallanpoe,"is, not exceeding eighty miles--the rarefaction would be so excessive"
edgarallanpoe,"that animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that"
edgarallanpoe,the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the
edgarallanpoe,atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence. But I
edgarallanpoe,did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded
edgarallanpoe,"altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and"
edgarallanpoe,"the mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may"
edgarallanpoe,"be called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth"
edgarallanpoe,"itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted that animal"
edgarallanpoe,life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given
edgarallanpoe,"unattainable distance from the surface. Now, all such reasoning and from"
edgarallanpoe,"such data must, of course, be simply analogical. The greatest height"
edgarallanpoe,"ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic"
edgarallanpoe,expedition of Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot. This is a moderate
edgarallanpoe,"altitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I"
edgarallanpoe,could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and
edgarallanpoe,great latitude for speculation.
edgarallanpoe,"“But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given altitude,"
edgarallanpoe,the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is
edgarallanpoe,by no means in proportion to the additional height ascended (as may
edgarallanpoe,"be plainly seen from what has been stated before), but in a ratio"
edgarallanpoe,"constantly decreasing. It is therefore evident that, ascend as high as"
edgarallanpoe,"we may, we cannot, literally speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which"
edgarallanpoe,"no atmosphere is to be found. It must exist, I argued; although it may"
edgarallanpoe,exist in a state of infinite rarefaction.
edgarallanpoe,"“On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been wanting"
edgarallanpoe,"to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere,"
edgarallanpoe,beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever. But a circumstance
edgarallanpoe,which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit
edgarallanpoe,"seemed to me, although no positive refutation of their creed, still"
edgarallanpoe,a point worthy very serious investigation. On comparing the intervals
edgarallanpoe,"between the successive arrivals of Encke’s comet at its perihelion,"
edgarallanpoe,"after giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances"
edgarallanpoe,"due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the periods are"
edgarallanpoe,"gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the comet’s"
edgarallanpoe,"ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease."
edgarallanpoe,"Now, this is precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose a"
edgarallanpoe,resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal
edgarallanpoe,medium pervading the regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such
edgarallanpoe,"a medium must, in retarding the comet’s velocity, increase its"
edgarallanpoe,"centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force. In other words, the"
edgarallanpoe,"sun’s attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. Indeed, there is no"
edgarallanpoe,other way of accounting for the variation in question. But again. The
edgarallanpoe,real diameter of the same comet’s nebulosity is observed to contract
edgarallanpoe,"rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate with equal rapidity in its"
edgarallanpoe,departure towards its aphelion. Was I not justifiable in supposing with
edgarallanpoe,"M. Valz, that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in"
edgarallanpoe,"the compression of the same ethereal medium I have spoken of before,"
edgarallanpoe,and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? The
edgarallanpoe,"lenticular-shaped phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a"
edgarallanpoe,"matter worthy of attention. This radiance, so apparent in the tropics,"
edgarallanpoe,"and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the"
edgarallanpoe,"horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction of the"
edgarallanpoe,sun’s equator. It appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare
edgarallanpoe,"atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of Venus at"
edgarallanpoe,"least, and I believed indefinitely farther.(*2) Indeed, this medium I"
edgarallanpoe,"could not suppose confined to the path of the comet’s ellipse, or to"
edgarallanpoe,"the immediate neighborhood of the sun. It was easy, on the contrary,"
edgarallanpoe,"to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our planetary system,"
edgarallanpoe,"condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves, and"
edgarallanpoe,"perhaps at some of them modified by considerations, so to speak, purely"
edgarallanpoe,geological.
edgarallanpoe,"“Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further"
edgarallanpoe,hesitation. Granting that on my passage I should meet with atmosphere
edgarallanpoe,"essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I conceived that,"
edgarallanpoe,"by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M. Grimm, I should readily"
edgarallanpoe,be enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of
edgarallanpoe,respiration. This would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the
edgarallanpoe,moon. I had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the
edgarallanpoe,"apparatus to the object intended, and confidently looked forward to its"
edgarallanpoe,"successful application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within"
edgarallanpoe,any reasonable period. This brings me back to the rate at which it might
edgarallanpoe,be possible to travel.
edgarallanpoe,"“It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions from"
edgarallanpoe,"the earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate."
edgarallanpoe,"Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of"
edgarallanpoe,"the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at"
edgarallanpoe,"first sight, it does not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires"
edgarallanpoe,"altitude, and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata"
edgarallanpoe,"of densities rapidly diminishing--I say, it does not appear at all"
edgarallanpoe,"reasonable that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity"
edgarallanpoe,"should be accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any"
edgarallanpoe,"recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate"
edgarallanpoe,"of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account"
edgarallanpoe,"of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons"
edgarallanpoe,"ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary"
edgarallanpoe,"varnish. It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such escape was only"
edgarallanpoe,sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power. I
edgarallanpoe,"now considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I"
edgarallanpoe,"had imagined, and provided that it should prove to be actually"
edgarallanpoe,"and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make"
edgarallanpoe,comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction
edgarallanpoe,"I should discover it--that is to say, in regard to my power of"
edgarallanpoe,ascending--for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject
edgarallanpoe,to rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to the occurrence of
edgarallanpoe,"which, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to"
edgarallanpoe,"prevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events,"
edgarallanpoe,continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere
edgarallanpoe,"nitrogen and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be"
edgarallanpoe,"constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances,"
edgarallanpoe,"and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I should at"
edgarallanpoe,length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth’s
edgarallanpoe,attraction would be superseded by that of the moon. In accordance with
edgarallanpoe,"these ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more"
edgarallanpoe,provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.
edgarallanpoe,"“There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned me some"
edgarallanpoe,"little disquietude. It has been observed, that, in balloon ascensions to"
edgarallanpoe,"any considerable height, besides the pain attending respiration, great"
edgarallanpoe,"uneasiness is experienced about the head and body, often accompanied"
edgarallanpoe,"with bleeding at the nose, and other symptoms of an alarming kind,"
edgarallanpoe,and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude
edgarallanpoe,attained.(*3) This was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling. Was
edgarallanpoe,"it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at"
edgarallanpoe,least until terminated by death itself? I finally thought not. Their
edgarallanpoe,origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary
edgarallanpoe,"atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and consequent"
edgarallanpoe,distention of the superficial blood-vessels--not in any positive
edgarallanpoe,"disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of difficulty in"
edgarallanpoe,"breathing, where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient"
edgarallanpoe,for the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the heart. Unless for
edgarallanpoe,"default of this renovation, I could see no reason, therefore, why"
edgarallanpoe,life could not be sustained even in a vacuum; for the expansion and
edgarallanpoe,"compression of chest, commonly called breathing, is action purely"
edgarallanpoe,"muscular, and the cause, not the effect, of respiration. In a word,"
edgarallanpoe,"I conceived that, as the body should become habituated to the want"
edgarallanpoe,"of atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually"
edgarallanpoe,"diminish--and to endure them while they continued, I relied with"
edgarallanpoe,confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution.
edgarallanpoe,"“Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some, though by"
edgarallanpoe,"no means all, the considerations which led me to form the project of"
edgarallanpoe,a lunar voyage. I shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an
edgarallanpoe,"attempt so apparently audacious in conception, and, at all events, so"
edgarallanpoe,utterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind.
edgarallanpoe,"“Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say three"
edgarallanpoe,"miles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity of"
edgarallanpoe,"feathers, and found that I still ascended with sufficient rapidity;"
edgarallanpoe,"there was, therefore, no necessity for discharging any ballast. I was"
edgarallanpoe,"glad of this, for I wished to retain with me as much weight as I could"
edgarallanpoe,"carry, for reasons which will be explained in the sequel. I as yet"
edgarallanpoe,"suffered no bodily inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and"
edgarallanpoe,feeling no pain whatever in the head. The cat was lying very demurely
edgarallanpoe,"upon my coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air"
edgarallanpoe,"of nonchalance. These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent their"
edgarallanpoe,"escape, were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered"
edgarallanpoe,for them in the bottom of the car.
edgarallanpoe,"“At twenty minutes past six o’clock, the barometer showed an elevation"
edgarallanpoe,"of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction. The prospect seemed"
edgarallanpoe,"unbounded. Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of spherical"
edgarallanpoe,"geometry, what a great extent of the earth’s area I beheld. The convex"
edgarallanpoe,"surface of any segment of a sphere is, to the entire surface of the"
edgarallanpoe,"sphere itself, as the versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the"
edgarallanpoe,"sphere. Now, in my case, the versed sine--that is to say, the thickness"
edgarallanpoe,"of the segment beneath me--was about equal to my elevation, or the"
edgarallanpoe,"elevation of the point of sight above the surface. ‘As five miles, then,"
edgarallanpoe,"to eight thousand,’ would express the proportion of the earth’s area"
edgarallanpoe,"seen by me. In other words, I beheld as much as a sixteen-hundredth"
edgarallanpoe,part of the whole surface of the globe. The sea appeared unruffled as a
edgarallanpoe,"mirror, although, by means of the spy-glass, I could perceive it to be"
edgarallanpoe,"in a state of violent agitation. The ship was no longer visible, having"
edgarallanpoe,"drifted away, apparently to the eastward. I now began to experience, at"
edgarallanpoe,"intervals, severe pain in the head, especially about the ears--still,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, breathing with tolerable freedom. The cat and pigeons seemed to"
edgarallanpoe,suffer no inconvenience whatsoever.
edgarallanpoe,"“At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long series of"
edgarallanpoe,"dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging my condensing"
edgarallanpoe,"apparatus and wetting me to the skin. This was, to be sure, a singular"
edgarallanpoe,"recontre, for I had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature"
edgarallanpoe,"could be sustained at so great an elevation. I thought it best, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"to throw out two five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight"
edgarallanpoe,"of one hundred and sixty-five pounds. Upon so doing, I soon rose above"
edgarallanpoe,"the difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a great"
edgarallanpoe,increase in my rate of ascent. In a few seconds after my leaving the
edgarallanpoe,"cloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other,"
edgarallanpoe,"and caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast extent, like a mass of"
edgarallanpoe,"ignited and glowing charcoal. This, it must be remembered, was in the"
edgarallanpoe,broad light of day. No fancy may picture the sublimity which might have
edgarallanpoe,been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of
edgarallanpoe,the night. Hell itself might have been found a fitting image. Even as
edgarallanpoe,"it was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the yawning"
edgarallanpoe,"abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and stalk about in the"
edgarallanpoe,"strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the"
edgarallanpoe,hideous and unfathomable fire. I had indeed made a narrow escape. Had
edgarallanpoe,the balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud--that
edgarallanpoe,"is to say--had not the inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to"
edgarallanpoe,"discharge the ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence."
edgarallanpoe,"Such perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest which"
edgarallanpoe,"must be encountered in balloons. I had by this time, however, attained"
edgarallanpoe,too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head.
edgarallanpoe,"“I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o’clock the barometer indicated"
edgarallanpoe,an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. I began to find great
edgarallanpoe,"difficulty in drawing my breath. My head, too, was excessively painful;"
edgarallanpoe,"and, having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks, I at length"
edgarallanpoe,"discovered it to be blood, which was oozing quite fast from the drums of"
edgarallanpoe,"my ears. My eyes, also, gave me great uneasiness. Upon passing the"
edgarallanpoe,hand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no
edgarallanpoe,"inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the balloon"
edgarallanpoe,"itself, appeared distorted to my vision. These symptoms were more than"
edgarallanpoe,"I had expected, and occasioned me some alarm. At this juncture, very"
edgarallanpoe,"imprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car three"
edgarallanpoe,five-pound pieces of ballast. The accelerated rate of ascent thus
edgarallanpoe,"obtained, carried me too rapidly, and without sufficient gradation, into"
edgarallanpoe,"a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly"
edgarallanpoe,proved fatal to my expedition and to myself. I was suddenly seized with
edgarallanpoe,"a spasm which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in"
edgarallanpoe,"a measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals, and"
edgarallanpoe,in a gasping manner--bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and
edgarallanpoe,"ears, and even slightly at the eyes. The pigeons appeared distressed"
edgarallanpoe,"in the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in"
edgarallanpoe,the car as if under the influence of poison. I now too late discovered
edgarallanpoe,the great rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the
edgarallanpoe,"ballast, and my agitation was excessive. I anticipated nothing less than"
edgarallanpoe,"death, and death in a few minutes. The physical suffering I underwent"
edgarallanpoe,contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion
edgarallanpoe,"for the preservation of my life. I had, indeed, little power of"
edgarallanpoe,"reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be"
edgarallanpoe,greatly on the increase. Thus I found that my senses would shortly give
edgarallanpoe,"way altogether, and I had already clutched one of the valve ropes with"
edgarallanpoe,"the view of attempting a descent, when the recollection of the trick I"
edgarallanpoe,"had played the three creditors, and the possible consequences to myself,"
edgarallanpoe,"should I return, operated to deter me for the moment. I lay down in the"
edgarallanpoe,"bottom of the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties. In this I"
edgarallanpoe,so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood.
edgarallanpoe,"Having no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the operation in"
edgarallanpoe,"the best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in opening a vein"
edgarallanpoe,"in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife. The blood had hardly"
edgarallanpoe,"commenced flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the time"
edgarallanpoe,"I had lost about half a moderate basin full, most of the worst symptoms"
edgarallanpoe,had abandoned me entirely. I nevertheless did not think it expedient to
edgarallanpoe,"attempt getting on my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as"
edgarallanpoe,"well as I could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour. At the end"
edgarallanpoe,"of this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of any"
edgarallanpoe,kind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension.
edgarallanpoe,"The difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished in a very slight"
edgarallanpoe,"degree, and I found that it would soon be positively necessary to make"
edgarallanpoe,"use of my condenser. In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was"
edgarallanpoe,"again snugly stowed away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite"
edgarallanpoe,"surprise, that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to"
edgarallanpoe,bring into light a litter of three little kittens. This was an addition
edgarallanpoe,to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was
edgarallanpoe,pleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a chance of bringing to a
edgarallanpoe,"kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than anything else,"
edgarallanpoe,had influenced me in attempting this ascension. I had imagined that the
edgarallanpoe,habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of
edgarallanpoe,"the earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending animal"
edgarallanpoe,existence at a distance above the surface. Should the kittens be found
edgarallanpoe,"to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must"
edgarallanpoe,"consider my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon"
edgarallanpoe,as a strong confirmation of my idea.
edgarallanpoe,“By eight o’clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen
edgarallanpoe,miles above the surface of the earth. Thus it seemed to me evident that
edgarallanpoe,"my rate of ascent was not only on the increase, but that the progression"
edgarallanpoe,would have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged
edgarallanpoe,"the ballast which I did. The pains in my head and ears returned, at"
edgarallanpoe,"intervals, with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at"
edgarallanpoe,"the nose; but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have"
edgarallanpoe,"been expected. I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and"
edgarallanpoe,"more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome"
edgarallanpoe,"spasmodic action of the chest. I now unpacked the condensing apparatus,"
edgarallanpoe,and got it ready for immediate use.
edgarallanpoe,"“The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was beautiful"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed. To the westward, the northward, and the southward, as far as I"
edgarallanpoe,"could see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which"
edgarallanpoe,every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already
edgarallanpoe,to assume a slight appearance of convexity. At a vast distance to the
edgarallanpoe,"eastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great"
edgarallanpoe,"Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small"
edgarallanpoe,portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. Of individual
edgarallanpoe,"edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of"
edgarallanpoe,mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth. From the rock
edgarallanpoe,"of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim speck, the dark Mediterranean sea,"
edgarallanpoe,"dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars, spread"
edgarallanpoe,"itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its"
edgarallanpoe,entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss
edgarallanpoe,"of the horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes"
edgarallanpoe,"of the mighty cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the"
edgarallanpoe,stars were brilliantly visible.
edgarallanpoe,"“The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I"
edgarallanpoe,"determined upon giving them their liberty. I first untied one of them,"
edgarallanpoe,"a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim of the"
edgarallanpoe,"wicker-work. He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously around him,"
edgarallanpoe,"fluttering his wings, and making a loud cooing noise, but could not be"
edgarallanpoe,"persuaded to trust himself from off the car. I took him up at last,"
edgarallanpoe,"and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon. He made,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, no attempt to descend as I had expected, but struggled with"
edgarallanpoe,"great vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and"
edgarallanpoe,piercing cries. He at length succeeded in regaining his former station
edgarallanpoe,"on the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his"
edgarallanpoe,"breast, and he fell dead within the car. The other one did not prove so"
edgarallanpoe,"unfortunate. To prevent his following the example of his companion, and"
edgarallanpoe,"accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with all my force, and was"
edgarallanpoe,"pleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity, making"
edgarallanpoe,"use of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner. In a very"
edgarallanpoe,"short time he was out of sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in"
edgarallanpoe,"safety. Puss, who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness,"
edgarallanpoe,now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much
edgarallanpoe,"apparent satisfaction. Her kittens were quite lively, and so far evinced"
edgarallanpoe,not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.
edgarallanpoe,"“At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath without"
edgarallanpoe,"the most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust around"
edgarallanpoe,the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser. This apparatus will
edgarallanpoe,"require some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to"
edgarallanpoe,"bear in mind that my object, in the first place, was to surround myself"
edgarallanpoe,and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere
edgarallanpoe,"in which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this"
edgarallanpoe,"barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere"
edgarallanpoe,sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration. With this object
edgarallanpoe,"in view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible"
edgarallanpoe,"gum-elastic bag. In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the"
edgarallanpoe,"entire car was in a manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was"
edgarallanpoe,"drawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along"
edgarallanpoe,"the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work"
edgarallanpoe,"is attached. Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete"
edgarallanpoe,"enclosure on all sides, and at bottom, it was now necessary to fasten"
edgarallanpoe,"up its top or mouth, by passing its material over the hoop of the"
edgarallanpoe,"net-work--in other words, between the net-work and the hoop. But if the"
edgarallanpoe,"net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was"
edgarallanpoe,to sustain the car in the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently
edgarallanpoe,"fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or"
edgarallanpoe,"nooses. I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving"
edgarallanpoe,the car suspended by the remainder. Having thus inserted a portion of
edgarallanpoe,"the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops--not"
edgarallanpoe,"to the hoop, for that would have been impossible, since the cloth"
edgarallanpoe,"now intervened--but to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth"
edgarallanpoe,"itself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals"
edgarallanpoe,between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals
edgarallanpoe,"between the loops. This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened"
edgarallanpoe,"from the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the"
edgarallanpoe,disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons. In this way
edgarallanpoe,it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the
edgarallanpoe,net-work and the hoop. It is evident that the hoop would now drop down
edgarallanpoe,"within the car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its"
edgarallanpoe,"contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons. This,"
edgarallanpoe,"at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no"
edgarallanpoe,"means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but"
edgarallanpoe,so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was
edgarallanpoe,"supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents been"
edgarallanpoe,"three times heavier than they were, I should not have been at"
edgarallanpoe,all uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of
edgarallanpoe,"gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by means of"
edgarallanpoe,"three light poles prepared for the occasion. This was done, of course,"
edgarallanpoe,"to keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part"
edgarallanpoe,of the net-work in its proper situation. All that now remained was to
edgarallanpoe,fasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished
edgarallanpoe,"by gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up"
edgarallanpoe,very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.
edgarallanpoe,"“In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had been"
edgarallanpoe,"inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass, through which I"
edgarallanpoe,could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction.
edgarallanpoe,"In that portion of the cloth forming the bottom, was likewise, a fourth"
edgarallanpoe,"window, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the"
edgarallanpoe,floor of the car itself. This enabled me to see perpendicularly
edgarallanpoe,"down, but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance"
edgarallanpoe,"overhead, on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening"
edgarallanpoe,"there, and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see"
edgarallanpoe,"no objects situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was a matter"
edgarallanpoe,of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at
edgarallanpoe,"top, the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it."
edgarallanpoe,"“About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening,"
edgarallanpoe,"eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its"
edgarallanpoe,inner edge to the windings of a screw. In this rim was screwed the large
edgarallanpoe,"tube of the condenser, the body of the machine being, of course, within"
edgarallanpoe,the chamber of gum-elastic. Through this tube a quantity of the rare
edgarallanpoe,atmosphere circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the
edgarallanpoe,"body of the machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation,"
edgarallanpoe,to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber. This operation being
edgarallanpoe,"repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere"
edgarallanpoe,proper for all the purposes of respiration. But in so confined a space
edgarallanpoe,"it would, in a short time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use"
edgarallanpoe,from frequent contact with the lungs. It was then ejected by a small
edgarallanpoe,valve at the bottom of the car--the dense air readily sinking into the
edgarallanpoe,thinner atmosphere below. To avoid the inconvenience of making a total
edgarallanpoe,"vacuum at any moment within the chamber, this purification was never"
edgarallanpoe,"accomplished all at once, but in a gradual manner--the valve being"
edgarallanpoe,"opened only for a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two"
edgarallanpoe,strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the
edgarallanpoe,atmosphere ejected. For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and
edgarallanpoe,"kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button"
edgarallanpoe,"at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I could feed them at"
edgarallanpoe,"any moment when necessary. I did this at some little risk, and before"
edgarallanpoe,"closing the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the car with one of"
edgarallanpoe,the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached.
edgarallanpoe,“By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled the
edgarallanpoe,"chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine o’clock. During"
edgarallanpoe,"the whole period of my being thus employed, I endured the most terrible"
edgarallanpoe,"distress from difficulty of respiration, and bitterly did I repent the"
edgarallanpoe,"negligence or rather fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of"
edgarallanpoe,putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance. But
edgarallanpoe,"having at length accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of"
edgarallanpoe,my invention. Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and ease--and
edgarallanpoe,"indeed why should I not? I was also agreeably surprised to find myself,"
edgarallanpoe,"in a great measure, relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto"
edgarallanpoe,"tormented me. A slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness"
edgarallanpoe,"or distention about the wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly"
edgarallanpoe,all of which I had now to complain. Thus it seemed evident that a
edgarallanpoe,greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric
edgarallanpoe,"pressure had actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of"
edgarallanpoe,the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed
edgarallanpoe,altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration.
edgarallanpoe,"“At twenty minutes before nine o’clock--that is to say, a short time"
edgarallanpoe,"prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury attained"
edgarallanpoe,"its limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I mentioned before,"
edgarallanpoe,was one of an extended construction. It then indicated an altitude on
edgarallanpoe,"my part of 132,000 feet, or five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently"
edgarallanpoe,surveyed at that time an extent of the earth’s area amounting to no less
edgarallanpoe,than the three hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies.
edgarallanpoe,"At nine o’clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not"
edgarallanpoe,before I became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the N.
edgarallanpoe,"N. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed,"
edgarallanpoe,although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which
edgarallanpoe,floated to and fro. I observed now that even the lightest vapors never
edgarallanpoe,rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea.
edgarallanpoe,“At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of
edgarallanpoe,feathers through the valve. They did not float as I had expected; but
edgarallanpoe,"dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the"
edgarallanpoe,greatest velocity--being out of sight in a very few seconds. I did not
edgarallanpoe,at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon; not being
edgarallanpoe,"able to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with"
edgarallanpoe,so prodigious an acceleration. But it soon occurred to me that the
edgarallanpoe,atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they
edgarallanpoe,"actually fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I"
edgarallanpoe,had been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own
edgarallanpoe,elevation.
edgarallanpoe,“By ten o’clock I found that I had very little to occupy my immediate
edgarallanpoe,"attention. Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the balloon to be"
edgarallanpoe,going upward with a speed increasing momently although I had no longer
edgarallanpoe,any means of ascertaining the progression of the increase. I suffered no
edgarallanpoe,"pain or uneasiness of any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I had"
edgarallanpoe,"at any period since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in"
edgarallanpoe,"examining the state of my various apparatus, and now in regenerating the"
edgarallanpoe,atmosphere within the chamber. This latter point I determined to
edgarallanpoe,"attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes, more on account of"
edgarallanpoe,"the preservation of my health, than from so frequent a renovation"
edgarallanpoe,being absolutely necessary. In the meanwhile I could not help making
edgarallanpoe,anticipations. Fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the
edgarallanpoe,"moon. Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled, roamed at will"
edgarallanpoe,among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land. Now
edgarallanpoe,"there were hoary and time-honored forests, and craggy precipices, and"
edgarallanpoe,waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom.
edgarallanpoe,"Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where no wind of"
edgarallanpoe,"heaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of poppies, and slender,"
edgarallanpoe,"lily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance, all silent"
edgarallanpoe,and motionless forever. Then again I journeyed far down away into
edgarallanpoe,"another country where it was all one dim and vague lake, with a boundary"
edgarallanpoe,line of clouds. And out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall
edgarallanpoe,"eastern trees, like a wilderness of dreams. And I have in mind that"
edgarallanpoe,the shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on
edgarallanpoe,"the surface where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and"
edgarallanpoe,"commingled with the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other"
edgarallanpoe,"shadows were continually coming out, and taking the place of their"
edgarallanpoe,"brothers thus entombed. “This then,” I said thoughtfully, “is the very"
edgarallanpoe,"reason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age, and more"
edgarallanpoe,melancholy as the hours run on.” But fancies such as these were not the
edgarallanpoe,sole possessors of my brain. Horrors of a nature most stern and most
edgarallanpoe,"appalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and"
edgarallanpoe,shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their
edgarallanpoe,possibility. Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time
edgarallanpoe,"to dwell upon these latter speculations, rightly judging the real and"
edgarallanpoe,palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention.
edgarallanpoe,"“At five o’clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere"
edgarallanpoe,"within the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and"
edgarallanpoe,kittens through the valve. The cat herself appeared to suffer again very
edgarallanpoe,"much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a"
edgarallanpoe,difficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted
edgarallanpoe,"very strangely. I had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of"
edgarallanpoe,"pain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have"
edgarallanpoe,been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance
edgarallanpoe,"of atmospheric pressure. But I was not prepared to find them, upon close"
edgarallanpoe,"examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing with"
edgarallanpoe,"the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest"
edgarallanpoe,sign of any uneasiness whatever. I could only account for all this by
edgarallanpoe,"extending my theory, and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere"
edgarallanpoe,"around might perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically"
edgarallanpoe,"insufficient for the purposes of life, and that a person born in such"
edgarallanpoe,"a medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience attending its"
edgarallanpoe,"inhalation, while, upon removal to the denser strata near the earth,"
edgarallanpoe,he might endure tortures of a similar nature to those I had so lately
edgarallanpoe,experienced. It has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an
edgarallanpoe,"awkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little"
edgarallanpoe,"family of cats, and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a"
edgarallanpoe,continued experiment might have afforded. In passing my hand through
edgarallanpoe,"the valve, with a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt"
edgarallanpoe,"became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in"
edgarallanpoe,"a moment, loosened it from the bottom. Had the whole actually vanished"
edgarallanpoe,"into air, it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and"
edgarallanpoe,"instantaneous manner. Positively, there could not have intervened the"
edgarallanpoe,tenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket and its
edgarallanpoe,absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained. My good
edgarallanpoe,"wishes followed it to the earth, but of course, I had no hope that"
edgarallanpoe,either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their
edgarallanpoe,misfortune.
edgarallanpoe,"“At six o’clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth’s visible area"
edgarallanpoe,"to the eastward involved in thick shadow, which continued to advance"
edgarallanpoe,"with great rapidity, until, at five minutes before seven, the whole"
edgarallanpoe,"surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night. It was not,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun"
edgarallanpoe,"ceased to illumine the balloon; and this circumstance, although of"
edgarallanpoe,"course fully anticipated, did not fail to give me an infinite deal"
edgarallanpoe,"of pleasure. It was evident that, in the morning, I should behold the"
edgarallanpoe,"rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of Rotterdam, in"
edgarallanpoe,"spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward, and thus, day"
edgarallanpoe,"after day, in proportion to the height ascended, would I enjoy the light"
edgarallanpoe,of the sun for a longer and a longer period. I now determined to keep a
edgarallanpoe,"journal of my passage, reckoning the days from one to twenty-four"
edgarallanpoe,"hours continuously, without taking into consideration the intervals of"
edgarallanpoe,darkness.
edgarallanpoe,"“At ten o’clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the rest"
edgarallanpoe,"of the night; but here a difficulty presented itself, which, obvious as"
edgarallanpoe,"it may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which"
edgarallanpoe,"I am now speaking. If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the"
edgarallanpoe,atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim? To breathe
edgarallanpoe,"it for more than an hour, at the farthest, would be a matter of"
edgarallanpoe,"impossibility, or, if even this term could be extended to an hour and a"
edgarallanpoe,"quarter, the most ruinous consequences might ensue. The consideration"
edgarallanpoe,of this dilemma gave me no little disquietude; and it will hardly be
edgarallanpoe,"believed, that, after the dangers I had undergone, I should look"
edgarallanpoe,"upon this business in so serious a light, as to give up all hope of"
edgarallanpoe,"accomplishing my ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to the"
edgarallanpoe,necessity of a descent. But this hesitation was only momentary. I
edgarallanpoe,"reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom, and that many points"
edgarallanpoe,"in the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important, which"
edgarallanpoe,are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual. It was very
edgarallanpoe,certain that I could not do without sleep; but I might easily bring
edgarallanpoe,myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an
edgarallanpoe,hour during the whole period of my repose. It would require but five
edgarallanpoe,"minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and"
edgarallanpoe,the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself
edgarallanpoe,"at the proper moment for so doing. But this was a question which, I am"
edgarallanpoe,"willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its solution. To"
edgarallanpoe,"be sure, I had heard of the student who, to prevent his falling asleep"
edgarallanpoe,"over his books, held in one hand a ball of copper, the din of whose"
edgarallanpoe,"descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair,"
edgarallanpoe,"served effectually to startle him up, if, at any moment, he should"
edgarallanpoe,"be overcome with drowsiness. My own case, however, was very different"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to"
edgarallanpoe,"keep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time."
edgarallanpoe,"I at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it may"
edgarallanpoe,"seem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an invention"
edgarallanpoe,"fully equal to that of the telescope, the steam-engine, or the art of"
edgarallanpoe,printing itself.
edgarallanpoe,"“It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation now"
edgarallanpoe,"attained, continued its course upward with an even and undeviating"
edgarallanpoe,"ascent, and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect"
edgarallanpoe,that it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest
edgarallanpoe,vacillation whatever. This circumstance favored me greatly in the
edgarallanpoe,project I now determined to adopt. My supply of water had been put on
edgarallanpoe,"board in kegs containing five gallons each, and ranged very securely"
edgarallanpoe,"around the interior of the car. I unfastened one of these, and taking"
edgarallanpoe,two ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from one
edgarallanpoe,side to the other; placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to
edgarallanpoe,"form a kind of shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a"
edgarallanpoe,"horizontal position. About eight inches immediately below these ropes,"
edgarallanpoe,and four feet from the bottom of the car I fastened another shelf--but
edgarallanpoe,"made of thin plank, being the only similar piece of wood I had. Upon"
edgarallanpoe,"this latter shelf, and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a"
edgarallanpoe,small earthern pitcher was deposited. I now bored a hole in the end of
edgarallanpoe,"the keg over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a"
edgarallanpoe,"tapering or conical shape. This plug I pushed in or pulled out, as might"
edgarallanpoe,"happen, until, after a few experiments, it arrived at that exact degree"
edgarallanpoe,"of tightness, at which the water, oozing from the hole, and falling into"
edgarallanpoe,"the pitcher below, would fill the latter to the brim in the period"
edgarallanpoe,"of sixty minutes. This, of course, was a matter briefly and easily"
edgarallanpoe,"ascertained, by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any"
edgarallanpoe,"given time. Having arranged all this, the rest of the plan is obvious."
edgarallanpoe,"My bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car, as to bring my"
edgarallanpoe,"head, in lying down, immediately below the mouth of the pitcher. It was"
edgarallanpoe,"evident, that, at the expiration of an hour, the pitcher, getting full,"
edgarallanpoe,"would be forced to run over, and to run over at the mouth, which was"
edgarallanpoe,"somewhat lower than the rim. It was also evident, that the water thus"
edgarallanpoe,"falling from a height of more than four feet, could not do otherwise"
edgarallanpoe,"than fall upon my face, and that the sure consequences would be, to"
edgarallanpoe,"waken me up instantaneously, even from the soundest slumber in the"
edgarallanpoe,world.
edgarallanpoe,"“It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these arrangements,"
edgarallanpoe,"and I immediately betook myself to bed, with full confidence in the"
edgarallanpoe,efficiency of my invention. Nor in this matter was I disappointed.
edgarallanpoe,"Punctually every sixty minutes was I aroused by my trusty chronometer,"
edgarallanpoe,"when, having emptied the pitcher into the bung-hole of the keg, and"
edgarallanpoe,"performed the duties of the condenser, I retired again to bed. These"
edgarallanpoe,regular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than
edgarallanpoe,"I had anticipated; and when I finally arose for the day, it was seven"
edgarallanpoe,"o’clock, and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my"
edgarallanpoe,horizon.
edgarallanpoe,"“April 3d. I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and the"
edgarallanpoe,earth’s apparent convexity increased in a material degree. Below me in
edgarallanpoe,"the ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which undoubtedly were islands."
edgarallanpoe,"Far away to the northward I perceived a thin, white, and exceedingly"
edgarallanpoe,"brilliant line, or streak, on the edge of the horizon, and I had no"
edgarallanpoe,hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the
edgarallanpoe,"Polar Sea. My curiosity was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing"
edgarallanpoe,"on much farther to the north, and might possibly, at some period, find"
edgarallanpoe,myself placed directly above the Pole itself. I now lamented that my
edgarallanpoe,"great elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a"
edgarallanpoe,"survey as I could wish. Much, however, might be ascertained. Nothing"
edgarallanpoe,else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day. My apparatus
edgarallanpoe,"all continued in good order, and the balloon still ascended without any"
edgarallanpoe,"perceptible vacillation. The cold was intense, and obliged me to wrap"
edgarallanpoe,"up closely in an overcoat. When darkness came over the earth, I betook"
edgarallanpoe,"myself to bed, although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight"
edgarallanpoe,all around my immediate situation. The water-clock was punctual in its
edgarallanpoe,"duty, and I slept until next morning soundly, with the exception of the"
edgarallanpoe,periodical interruption.
edgarallanpoe,"“April 4th. Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished at the"
edgarallanpoe,singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea.
edgarallanpoe,"It had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue it had hitherto"
edgarallanpoe,"worn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre dazzling to the eye."
edgarallanpoe,The islands were no longer visible; whether they had passed down the
edgarallanpoe,"horizon to the southeast, or whether my increasing elevation had left"
edgarallanpoe,"them out of sight, it is impossible to say. I was inclined, however, to"
edgarallanpoe,the latter opinion. The rim of ice to the northward was growing more
edgarallanpoe,and more apparent. Cold by no means so intense. Nothing of importance
edgarallanpoe,"occurred, and I passed the day in reading, having taken care to supply"
edgarallanpoe,myself with books.
edgarallanpoe,“April 5th. Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while
edgarallanpoe,nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved
edgarallanpoe,"in darkness. In time, however, the light spread itself over all, and I"
edgarallanpoe,"again saw the line of ice to the northward. It was now very distinct,"
edgarallanpoe,and appeared of a much darker hue than the waters of the ocean. I was
edgarallanpoe,"evidently approaching it, and with great rapidity. Fancied I could"
edgarallanpoe,"again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the"
edgarallanpoe,"westward, but could not be certain. Weather moderate. Nothing of any"
edgarallanpoe,consequence happened during the day. Went early to bed.
edgarallanpoe,“April 6th. Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate
edgarallanpoe,"distance, and an immense field of the same material stretching away off"
edgarallanpoe,to the horizon in the north. It was evident that if the balloon held its
edgarallanpoe,"present course, it would soon arrive above the Frozen Ocean, and I had"
edgarallanpoe,now little doubt of ultimately seeing the Pole. During the whole of the
edgarallanpoe,day I continued to near the ice. Toward night the limits of my horizon
edgarallanpoe,"very suddenly and materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the"
edgarallanpoe,"earth’s form being that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the"
edgarallanpoe,flattened regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle. When darkness at
edgarallanpoe,"length overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass over"
edgarallanpoe,the object of so much curiosity when I should have no opportunity of
edgarallanpoe,observing it.
edgarallanpoe,"“April 7th. Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld what"
edgarallanpoe,there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole itself. It
edgarallanpoe,"was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but, alas! I"
edgarallanpoe,"had now ascended to so vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy"
edgarallanpoe,"be discerned. Indeed, to judge from the progression of the numbers"
edgarallanpoe,"indicating my various altitudes, respectively, at different periods,"
edgarallanpoe,"between six A.M. on the second of April, and twenty minutes before nine"
edgarallanpoe,"A.M. of the same day (at which time the barometer ran down), it might be"
edgarallanpoe,"fairly inferred that the balloon had now, at four o’clock in the morning"
edgarallanpoe,"of April the seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly, than"
edgarallanpoe,"7,254 miles above the surface of the sea. This elevation may appear"
edgarallanpoe,"immense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in"
edgarallanpoe,all probability far inferior to the truth. At all events I undoubtedly
edgarallanpoe,beheld the whole of the earth’s major diameter; the entire northern
edgarallanpoe,hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart orthographically projected: and
edgarallanpoe,the great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of
edgarallanpoe,"my horizon. Your Excellencies may, however, readily imagine that the"
edgarallanpoe,confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the Arctic
edgarallanpoe,"circle, although situated directly beneath me, and therefore seen"
edgarallanpoe,"without any appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in"
edgarallanpoe,"themselves, comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a distance"
edgarallanpoe,"from the point of sight, to admit of any very accurate examination."
edgarallanpoe,"Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting."
edgarallanpoe,"Northwardly from that huge rim before mentioned, and which, with slight"
edgarallanpoe,"qualification, may be called the limit of human discovery in these"
edgarallanpoe,"regions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to"
edgarallanpoe,"extend. In the first few degrees of this its progress, its surface is"
edgarallanpoe,"very sensibly flattened, farther on depressed into a plane, and finally,"
edgarallanpoe,"becoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a"
edgarallanpoe,"circular centre, sharply defined, whose apparent diameter subtended at"
edgarallanpoe,"the balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds, and whose dusky hue,"
edgarallanpoe,"varying in intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon"
edgarallanpoe,"the visible hemisphere, and occasionally deepened into the most"
edgarallanpoe,"absolute and impenetrable blackness. Farther than this, little could"
edgarallanpoe,be ascertained. By twelve o’clock the circular centre had materially
edgarallanpoe,"decreased in circumference, and by seven P.M. I lost sight of it"
edgarallanpoe,"entirely; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice, and"
edgarallanpoe,floating away rapidly in the direction of the equator.
edgarallanpoe,“April 8th. Found a sensible diminution in the earth’s apparent
edgarallanpoe,"diameter, besides a material alteration in its general color and"
edgarallanpoe,appearance. The whole visible area partook in different degrees of a
edgarallanpoe,"tint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even"
edgarallanpoe,painful to the eye. My view downward was also considerably impeded by
edgarallanpoe,the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with
edgarallanpoe,"clouds, between whose masses I could only now and then obtain a glimpse"
edgarallanpoe,of the earth itself. This difficulty of direct vision had troubled me
edgarallanpoe,more or less for the last forty-eight hours; but my present enormous
edgarallanpoe,"elevation brought closer together, as it were, the floating bodies of"
edgarallanpoe,"vapor, and the inconvenience became, of course, more and more palpable"
edgarallanpoe,"in proportion to my ascent. Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that"
edgarallanpoe,the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent
edgarallanpoe,"of North America, and was holding a course, due south, which would bring"
edgarallanpoe,me to the tropics. This circumstance did not fail to give me the most
edgarallanpoe,"heartful satisfaction, and I hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate"
edgarallanpoe,"success. Indeed, the direction I had hitherto taken, had filled me with"
edgarallanpoe,"uneasiness; for it was evident that, had I continued it much longer,"
edgarallanpoe,"there would have been no possibility of my arriving at the moon at all,"
edgarallanpoe,whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at only the small angle of 5
edgarallanpoe,degrees 8’ 48”.
edgarallanpoe,"“April 9th. To-day the earth’s diameter was greatly diminished, and the"
edgarallanpoe,color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow. The balloon
edgarallanpoe,"kept steadily on her course to the southward, and arrived, at nine P.M.,"
edgarallanpoe,over the northern edge of the Mexican Gulf.
edgarallanpoe,"“April 10th. I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five o’clock"
edgarallanpoe,"this morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for which I"
edgarallanpoe,"could in no manner account. It was of very brief duration, but, while"
edgarallanpoe,it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which I had any previous
edgarallanpoe,"experience. It is needless to say that I became excessively alarmed,"
edgarallanpoe,"having, in the first instance, attributed the noise to the bursting of"
edgarallanpoe,"the balloon. I examined all my apparatus, however, with great attention,"
edgarallanpoe,and could discover nothing out of order. Spent a great part of the day
edgarallanpoe,"in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no"
edgarallanpoe,"means whatever of accounting for it. Went to bed dissatisfied, and in a"
edgarallanpoe,state of great anxiety and agitation.
edgarallanpoe,“April 11th. Found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of
edgarallanpoe,"the earth, and a considerable increase, now observable for the first"
edgarallanpoe,"time, in that of the moon itself, which wanted only a few days of being"
edgarallanpoe,full. It now required long and excessive labor to condense within the
edgarallanpoe,chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life.
edgarallanpoe,“April 12th. A singular alteration took place in regard to the direction
edgarallanpoe,"of the balloon, and although fully anticipated, afforded me the most"
edgarallanpoe,"unequivocal delight. Having reached, in its former course, about the"
edgarallanpoe,"twentieth parallel of southern latitude, it turned off suddenly, at an"
edgarallanpoe,"acute angle, to the eastward, and thus proceeded throughout the day,"
edgarallanpoe,"keeping nearly, if not altogether, in the exact plane of the lunar"
edgarallanpoe,"elipse. What was worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in"
edgarallanpoe,the car was a consequence of this change of route--a vacillation which
edgarallanpoe,"prevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many hours."
edgarallanpoe,"“April 13th. Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud,"
edgarallanpoe,crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth. Thought long upon
edgarallanpoe,"the subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion. Great"
edgarallanpoe,"decrease in the earth’s apparent diameter, which now subtended from the"
edgarallanpoe,balloon an angle of very little more than twenty-five degrees. The moon
edgarallanpoe,"could not be seen at all, being nearly in my zenith. I still continued"
edgarallanpoe,"in the plane of the elipse, but made little progress to the eastward."
edgarallanpoe,“April 14th. Extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth.
edgarallanpoe,"To-day I became strongly impressed with the idea, that the balloon was"
edgarallanpoe,now actually running up the line of apsides to the point of perigee--in
edgarallanpoe,"other words, holding the direct course which would bring it immediately"
edgarallanpoe,to the moon in that part of its orbit the nearest to the earth. The moon
edgarallanpoe,"itself was directly overhead, and consequently hidden from my view."
edgarallanpoe,Great and long-continued labor necessary for the condensation of the
edgarallanpoe,atmosphere.
edgarallanpoe,“April 15th. Not even the outlines of continents and seas could now
edgarallanpoe,be traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness. About
edgarallanpoe,"twelve o’clock I became aware, for the third time, of that appalling"
edgarallanpoe,"sound which had so astonished me before. It now, however, continued for"
edgarallanpoe,"some moments, and gathered intensity as it continued. At length, while,"
edgarallanpoe,"stupefied and terror-stricken, I stood in expectation of I knew not what"
edgarallanpoe,"hideous destruction, the car vibrated with excessive violence, and"
edgarallanpoe,a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which I could not
edgarallanpoe,"distinguish, came with a voice of a thousand thunders, roaring and"
edgarallanpoe,booming by the balloon. When my fears and astonishment had in some
edgarallanpoe,"degree subsided, I had little difficulty in supposing it to be some"
edgarallanpoe,mighty volcanic fragment ejected from that world to which I was so
edgarallanpoe,"rapidly approaching, and, in all probability, one of that singular class"
edgarallanpoe,"of substances occasionally picked up on the earth, and termed meteoric"
edgarallanpoe,stones for want of a better appellation.
edgarallanpoe,"“April 16th. To-day, looking upward as well as I could, through each"
edgarallanpoe,"of the side windows alternately, I beheld, to my great delight, a very"
edgarallanpoe,"small portion of the moon’s disk protruding, as it were, on all sides"
edgarallanpoe,beyond the huge circumference of the balloon. My agitation was extreme;
edgarallanpoe,for I had now little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous
edgarallanpoe,"voyage. Indeed, the labor now required by the condenser had increased"
edgarallanpoe,"to a most oppressive degree, and allowed me scarcely any respite from"
edgarallanpoe,exertion. Sleep was a matter nearly out of the question. I became quite
edgarallanpoe,"ill, and my frame trembled with exhaustion. It was impossible that human"
edgarallanpoe,nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer. During
edgarallanpoe,the now brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again passed in my
edgarallanpoe,"vicinity, and the frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me much"
edgarallanpoe,apprehension.
edgarallanpoe,“April 17th. This morning proved an epoch in my voyage. It will be
edgarallanpoe,"remembered that, on the thirteenth, the earth subtended an angular"
edgarallanpoe,breadth of twenty-five degrees. On the fourteenth this had greatly
edgarallanpoe,diminished; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease was
edgarallanpoe,"observable; and, on retiring on the night of the sixteenth, I had"
edgarallanpoe,noticed an angle of no more than about seven degrees and fifteen
edgarallanpoe,"minutes. What, therefore, must have been my amazement, on awakening"
edgarallanpoe,"from a brief and disturbed slumber, on the morning of this day,"
edgarallanpoe,"the seventeenth, at finding the surface beneath me so suddenly and"
edgarallanpoe,"wonderfully augmented in volume, as to subtend no less than thirty-nine"
edgarallanpoe,degrees in apparent angular diameter! I was thunderstruck! No words
edgarallanpoe,"can give any adequate idea of the extreme, the absolute horror and"
edgarallanpoe,"astonishment, with which I was seized possessed, and altogether"
edgarallanpoe,overwhelmed. My knees tottered beneath me--my teeth chattered--my hair
edgarallanpoe,"started up on end. “The balloon, then, had actually burst!” These were"
edgarallanpoe,the first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind: “The balloon
edgarallanpoe,"had positively burst!--I was falling--falling with the most impetuous,"
edgarallanpoe,the most unparalleled velocity! To judge by the immense distance already
edgarallanpoe,"so quickly passed over, it could not be more than ten minutes, at the"
edgarallanpoe,"farthest, before I should meet the surface of the earth, and be hurled"
edgarallanpoe,into annihilation!” But at length reflection came to my relief. I
edgarallanpoe,paused; I considered; and I began to doubt. The matter was impossible.
edgarallanpoe,"I could not in any reason have so rapidly come down. Besides, although"
edgarallanpoe,"I was evidently approaching the surface below me, it was with a speed"
edgarallanpoe,by no means commensurate with the velocity I had at first so horribly
edgarallanpoe,conceived. This consideration served to calm the perturbation of my
edgarallanpoe,"mind, and I finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its proper"
edgarallanpoe,"point of view. In fact, amazement must have fairly deprived me of my"
edgarallanpoe,"senses, when I could not see the vast difference, in appearance, between"
edgarallanpoe,"the surface below me, and the surface of my mother earth. The latter"
edgarallanpoe,"was indeed over my head, and completely hidden by the balloon, while the"
edgarallanpoe,"moon--the moon itself in all its glory--lay beneath me, and at my feet."
edgarallanpoe,“The stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this extraordinary
edgarallanpoe,"change in the posture of affairs was perhaps, after all, that part of"
edgarallanpoe,the adventure least susceptible of explanation. For the bouleversement
edgarallanpoe,"in itself was not only natural and inevitable, but had been long"
edgarallanpoe,actually anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever I should
edgarallanpoe,arrive at that exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the
edgarallanpoe,"planet should be superseded by the attraction of the satellite--or, more"
edgarallanpoe,"precisely, where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should"
edgarallanpoe,be less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon. To be sure I
edgarallanpoe,"arose from a sound slumber, with all my senses in confusion, to the"
edgarallanpoe,"contemplation of a very startling phenomenon, and one which, although"
edgarallanpoe,"expected, was not expected at the moment. The revolution itself must, of"
edgarallanpoe,"course, have taken place in an easy and gradual manner, and it is by no"
edgarallanpoe,"means clear that, had I even been awake at the time of the occurrence,"
edgarallanpoe,I should have been made aware of it by any internal evidence of an
edgarallanpoe,"inversion--that is to say, by any inconvenience or disarrangement,"
edgarallanpoe,either about my person or about my apparatus.
edgarallanpoe,"“It is almost needless to say that, upon coming to a due sense of my"
edgarallanpoe,"situation, and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty"
edgarallanpoe,"of my soul, my attention was, in the first place, wholly directed to"
edgarallanpoe,the contemplation of the general physical appearance of the moon. It
edgarallanpoe,lay beneath me like a chart--and although I judged it to be still at no
edgarallanpoe,"inconsiderable distance, the indentures of its surface were defined"
edgarallanpoe,to my vision with a most striking and altogether unaccountable
edgarallanpoe,"distinctness. The entire absence of ocean or sea, and indeed of any lake"
edgarallanpoe,"or river, or body of water whatsoever, struck me, at first glance, as"
edgarallanpoe,"the most extraordinary feature in its geological condition. Yet, strange"
edgarallanpoe,"to say, I beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial,"
edgarallanpoe,although by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was
edgarallanpoe,"covered with innumerable volcanic mountains, conical in shape, and"
edgarallanpoe,having more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance.
edgarallanpoe,The highest among them does not exceed three and three-quarter miles
edgarallanpoe,in perpendicular elevation; but a map of the volcanic districts of the
edgarallanpoe,Campi Phlegraei would afford to your Excellencies a better idea of their
edgarallanpoe,general surface than any unworthy description I might think proper to
edgarallanpoe,"attempt. The greater part of them were in a state of evident eruption,"
edgarallanpoe,"and gave me fearfully to understand their fury and their power, by the"
edgarallanpoe,"repeated thunders of the miscalled meteoric stones, which now rushed"
edgarallanpoe,upward by the balloon with a frequency more and more appalling.
edgarallanpoe,“April 18th. To-day I found an enormous increase in the moon’s apparent
edgarallanpoe,bulk--and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill
edgarallanpoe,"me with alarm. It will be remembered, that, in the earliest stage of"
edgarallanpoe,"my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon, the"
edgarallanpoe,"existence, in its vicinity, of an atmosphere, dense in proportion to the"
edgarallanpoe,"bulk of the planet, had entered largely into my calculations; this too"
edgarallanpoe,"in spite of many theories to the contrary, and, it may be added, in"
edgarallanpoe,spite of a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at
edgarallanpoe,"all. But, in addition to what I have already urged in regard to Encke’s"
edgarallanpoe,"comet and the zodiacal light, I had been strengthened in my opinion by"
edgarallanpoe,"certain observations of Mr. Schroeter, of Lilienthal. He observed the"
edgarallanpoe,"moon when two days and a half old, in the evening soon after sunset,"
edgarallanpoe,"before the dark part was visible, and continued to watch it until it"
edgarallanpoe,became visible. The two cusps appeared tapering in a very sharp faint
edgarallanpoe,"prolongation, each exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated"
edgarallanpoe,"by the solar rays, before any part of the dark hemisphere was"
edgarallanpoe,"visible. Soon afterward, the whole dark limb became illuminated. This"
edgarallanpoe,"prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle, I thought, must have"
edgarallanpoe,arisen from the refraction of the sun’s rays by the moon’s atmosphere. I
edgarallanpoe,"computed, also, the height of the atmosphere (which could refract light"
edgarallanpoe,enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a twilight more luminous than
edgarallanpoe,the light reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32 degrees
edgarallanpoe,"from the new) to be 1,356 Paris feet; in this view, I supposed the"
edgarallanpoe,"greatest height capable of refracting the solar ray, to be 5,376 feet."
edgarallanpoe,My ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in
edgarallanpoe,"the eighty-second volume of the Philosophical Transactions, in which"
edgarallanpoe,"it is stated that at an occultation of Jupiter’s satellites, the third"
edgarallanpoe,"disappeared after having been about 1” or 2” of time indistinct, and the"
edgarallanpoe,fourth became indiscernible near the limb.(*4)
edgarallanpoe,"“Cassini frequently observed Saturn, Jupiter, and the fixed stars,"
edgarallanpoe,"when approaching the moon to occultation, to have their circular figure"
edgarallanpoe,"changed into an oval one; and, in other occultations, he found no"
edgarallanpoe,"alteration of figure at all. Hence it might be supposed, that at some"
edgarallanpoe,"times and not at others, there is a dense matter encompassing the moon"
edgarallanpoe,wherein the rays of the stars are refracted.
edgarallanpoe,"“Upon the resistance or, more properly, upon the support of an"
edgarallanpoe,"atmosphere, existing in the state of density imagined, I had, of course,"
edgarallanpoe,"entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent. Should I then,"
edgarallanpoe,"after all, prove to have been mistaken, I had in consequence nothing"
edgarallanpoe,"better to expect, as a finale to my adventure, than being dashed into"
edgarallanpoe,"atoms against the rugged surface of the satellite. And, indeed, I"
edgarallanpoe,had now every reason to be terrified. My distance from the moon was
edgarallanpoe,"comparatively trifling, while the labor required by the condenser was"
edgarallanpoe,"diminished not at all, and I could discover no indication whatever of a"
edgarallanpoe,decreasing rarity in the air.
edgarallanpoe,"“April 19th. This morning, to my great joy, about nine o’clock, the"
edgarallanpoe,"surface of the moon being frightfully near, and my apprehensions excited"
edgarallanpoe,"to the utmost, the pump of my condenser at length gave evident tokens"
edgarallanpoe,"of an alteration in the atmosphere. By ten, I had reason to believe"
edgarallanpoe,"its density considerably increased. By eleven, very little labor was"
edgarallanpoe,"necessary at the apparatus; and at twelve o’clock, with some hesitation,"
edgarallanpoe,"I ventured to unscrew the tourniquet, when, finding no inconvenience"
edgarallanpoe,"from having done so, I finally threw open the gum-elastic chamber, and"
edgarallanpoe,"unrigged it from around the car. As might have been expected, spasms"
edgarallanpoe,and violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment
edgarallanpoe,so precipitate and full of danger. But these and other difficulties
edgarallanpoe,"attending respiration, as they were by no means so great as to put me"
edgarallanpoe,"in peril of my life, I determined to endure as I best could, in"
edgarallanpoe,consideration of my leaving them behind me momently in my approach
edgarallanpoe,"to the denser strata near the moon. This approach, however, was still"
edgarallanpoe,"impetuous in the extreme; and it soon became alarmingly certain that,"
edgarallanpoe,although I had probably not been deceived in the expectation of an
edgarallanpoe,"atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite, still I"
edgarallanpoe,"had been wrong in supposing this density, even at the surface, at all"
edgarallanpoe,adequate to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my
edgarallanpoe,"balloon. Yet this should have been the case, and in an equal degree"
edgarallanpoe,"as at the surface of the earth, the actual gravity of bodies at either"
edgarallanpoe,planet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric condensation. That
edgarallanpoe,"it was not the case, however, my precipitous downfall gave testimony"
edgarallanpoe,"enough; why it was not so, can only be explained by a reference to those"
edgarallanpoe,possible geological disturbances to which I have formerly alluded. At
edgarallanpoe,"all events I was now close upon the planet, and coming down with the"
edgarallanpoe,"most terrible impetuosity. I lost not a moment, accordingly, in throwing"
edgarallanpoe,"overboard first my ballast, then my water-kegs, then my condensing"
edgarallanpoe,"apparatus and gum-elastic chamber, and finally every article within the"
edgarallanpoe,"car. But it was all to no purpose. I still fell with horrible rapidity,"
edgarallanpoe,and was now not more than half a mile from the surface. As a last
edgarallanpoe,"resource, therefore, having got rid of my coat, hat, and boots, I cut"
edgarallanpoe,"loose from the balloon the car itself, which was of no inconsiderable"
edgarallanpoe,"weight, and thus, clinging with both hands to the net-work, I had barely"
edgarallanpoe,"time to observe that the whole country, as far as the eye could reach,"
edgarallanpoe,"was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations, ere I tumbled"
edgarallanpoe,"headlong into the very heart of a fantastical-looking city, and into the"
edgarallanpoe,"middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people, who none of them uttered"
edgarallanpoe,"a single syllable, or gave themselves the least trouble to render me"
edgarallanpoe,"assistance, but stood, like a parcel of idiots, grinning in a ludicrous"
edgarallanpoe,"manner, and eyeing me and my balloon askant, with their arms set"
edgarallanpoe,"a-kimbo. I turned from them in contempt, and, gazing upward at the earth"
edgarallanpoe,"so lately left, and left perhaps for ever, beheld it like a huge, dull,"
edgarallanpoe,"copper shield, about two degrees in diameter, fixed immovably in the"
edgarallanpoe,"heavens overhead, and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent"
edgarallanpoe,border of the most brilliant gold. No traces of land or water could be
edgarallanpoe,"discovered, and the whole was clouded with variable spots, and belted"
edgarallanpoe,with tropical and equatorial zones.
edgarallanpoe,"“Thus, may it please your Excellencies, after a series of great"
edgarallanpoe,"anxieties, unheard of dangers, and unparalleled escapes, I had, at"
edgarallanpoe,"length, on the nineteenth day of my departure from Rotterdam, arrived in"
edgarallanpoe,"safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most extraordinary,"
edgarallanpoe,"and the most momentous, ever accomplished, undertaken, or conceived by"
edgarallanpoe,any denizen of earth. But my adventures yet remain to be related. And
edgarallanpoe,"indeed your Excellencies may well imagine that, after a residence of"
edgarallanpoe,five years upon a planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar
edgarallanpoe,"character, but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection, in"
edgarallanpoe,"capacity of satellite, with the world inhabited by man, I may have"
edgarallanpoe,intelligence for the private ear of the States’ College of Astronomers
edgarallanpoe,"of far more importance than the details, however wonderful, of the mere"
edgarallanpoe,"voyage which so happily concluded. This is, in fact, the case. I"
edgarallanpoe,have much--very much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to
edgarallanpoe,communicate. I have much to say of the climate of the planet; of its
edgarallanpoe,"wonderful alternations of heat and cold, of unmitigated and burning"
edgarallanpoe,"sunshine for one fortnight, and more than polar frigidity for the next;"
edgarallanpoe,"of a constant transfer of moisture, by distillation like that in vacuo,"
edgarallanpoe,from the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it; of
edgarallanpoe,"a variable zone of running water, of the people themselves; of their"
edgarallanpoe,"manners, customs, and political institutions; of their peculiar physical"
edgarallanpoe,"construction; of their ugliness; of their want of ears, those useless"
edgarallanpoe,appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified; of their consequent
edgarallanpoe,ignorance of the use and properties of speech; of their substitute
edgarallanpoe,for speech in a singular method of inter-communication; of the
edgarallanpoe,incomprehensible connection between each particular individual in
edgarallanpoe,the moon with some particular individual on the earth--a connection
edgarallanpoe,"analogous with, and depending upon, that of the orbs of the planet and"
edgarallanpoe,"the satellites, and by means of which the lives and destinies of the"
edgarallanpoe,inhabitants of the one are interwoven with the lives and destinies
edgarallanpoe,"of the inhabitants of the other; and above all, if it so please your"
edgarallanpoe,"Excellencies--above all, of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie"
edgarallanpoe,"in the outer regions of the moon--regions which, owing to the almost"
edgarallanpoe,miraculous accordance of the satellite’s rotation on its own axis with
edgarallanpoe,"its sidereal revolution about the earth, have never yet been turned,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, by God’s mercy, never shall be turned, to the scrutiny of the"
edgarallanpoe,"telescopes of man. All this, and more--much more--would I most"
edgarallanpoe,"willingly detail. But, to be brief, I must have my reward. I am pining"
edgarallanpoe,"for a return to my family and to my home, and as the price of any"
edgarallanpoe,farther communication on my part--in consideration of the light which
edgarallanpoe,I have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of
edgarallanpoe,"physical and metaphysical science--I must solicit, through the influence"
edgarallanpoe,"of your honorable body, a pardon for the crime of which I have been"
edgarallanpoe,guilty in the death of the creditors upon my departure from Rotterdam.
edgarallanpoe,"This, then, is the object of the present paper. Its bearer, an"
edgarallanpoe,"inhabitant of the moon, whom I have prevailed upon, and properly"
edgarallanpoe,"instructed, to be my messenger to the earth, will await your"
edgarallanpoe,"Excellencies’ pleasure, and return to me with the pardon in question, if"
edgarallanpoe,"it can, in any manner, be obtained."
edgarallanpoe,"“I have the honor to be, etc., your Excellencies’ very humble servant,"
edgarallanpoe,“HANS PFAALL.”
edgarallanpoe,"Upon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document,"
edgarallanpoe,"Professor Rub-a-dub, it is said, dropped his pipe upon the ground in"
edgarallanpoe,"the extremity of his surprise, and Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk having"
edgarallanpoe,"taken off his spectacles, wiped them, and deposited them in his pocket,"
edgarallanpoe,"so far forgot both himself and his dignity, as to turn round three times"
edgarallanpoe,upon his heel in the quintessence of astonishment and admiration. There
edgarallanpoe,was no doubt about the matter--the pardon should be obtained. So at
edgarallanpoe,"least swore, with a round oath, Professor Rub-a-dub, and so finally"
edgarallanpoe,"thought the illustrious Von Underduk, as he took the arm of his brother"
edgarallanpoe,"in science, and without saying a word, began to make the best of his way"
edgarallanpoe,home to deliberate upon the measures to be adopted. Having reached the
edgarallanpoe,"door, however, of the burgomaster’s dwelling, the professor ventured to"
edgarallanpoe,suggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear--no
edgarallanpoe,doubt frightened to death by the savage appearance of the burghers of
edgarallanpoe,"Rotterdam--the pardon would be of little use, as no one but a man of"
edgarallanpoe,the moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance. To the truth of
edgarallanpoe,"this observation the burgomaster assented, and the matter was therefore"
edgarallanpoe,"at an end. Not so, however, rumors and speculations. The letter, having"
edgarallanpoe,"been published, gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion. Some of"
edgarallanpoe,the over-wise even made themselves ridiculous by decrying the whole
edgarallanpoe,"business; as nothing better than a hoax. But hoax, with these sort"
edgarallanpoe,"of people, is, I believe, a general term for all matters above their"
edgarallanpoe,"comprehension. For my part, I cannot conceive upon what data they have"
edgarallanpoe,founded such an accusation. Let us see what they say:
edgarallanpoe,Imprimus. That certain wags in Rotterdam have certain especial
edgarallanpoe,antipathies to certain burgomasters and astronomers.
edgarallanpoe,Don’t understand at all.
edgarallanpoe,"Secondly. That an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer, both of whose"
edgarallanpoe,"ears, for some misdemeanor, have been cut off close to his head, has"
edgarallanpoe,been missing for several days from the neighboring city of Bruges.
edgarallanpoe,Well--what of that?
edgarallanpoe,Thirdly. That the newspapers which were stuck all over the little
edgarallanpoe,"balloon were newspapers of Holland, and therefore could not have been"
edgarallanpoe,"made in the moon. They were dirty papers--very dirty--and Gluck, the"
edgarallanpoe,"printer, would take his Bible oath to their having been printed in"
edgarallanpoe,Rotterdam.
edgarallanpoe,He was mistaken--undoubtedly--mistaken.
edgarallanpoe,"Fourthly, That Hans Pfaall himself, the drunken villain, and the three"
edgarallanpoe,"very idle gentlemen styled his creditors, were all seen, no longer than"
edgarallanpoe,"two or three days ago, in a tippling house in the suburbs, having just"
edgarallanpoe,"returned, with money in their pockets, from a trip beyond the sea."
edgarallanpoe,Don’t believe it--don’t believe a word of it.
edgarallanpoe,"Lastly. That it is an opinion very generally received, or which ought"
edgarallanpoe,"to be generally received, that the College of Astronomers in the city"
edgarallanpoe,"of Rotterdam, as well as other colleges in all other parts of the"
edgarallanpoe,"world,--not to mention colleges and astronomers in general,--are, to say"
edgarallanpoe,"the least of the matter, not a whit better, nor greater, nor wiser than"
edgarallanpoe,they ought to be.

edgarallanpoe,Notes to Hans Pfaal
edgarallanpoe,"(*1) NOTE--Strictly speaking, there is but little similarity between the"
edgarallanpoe,above sketchy trifle and the celebrated “Moon-Story” of Mr. Locke; but
edgarallanpoe,as both have the character of _hoaxes _(although the one is in a tone of
edgarallanpoe,"banter, the other of downright earnest), and as both hoaxes are on the"
edgarallanpoe,"same subject, the moon--moreover, as both attempt to give plausibility"
edgarallanpoe,by scientific detail--the author of “Hans Pfaall” thinks it necessary to
edgarallanpoe,"say, in _self-defence, _that his own _jeu d’esprit _was published in the"
edgarallanpoe,“Southern Literary Messenger” about three weeks before the commencement
edgarallanpoe,"of Mr. L’s in the “New York Sun.” Fancying a likeness which, perhaps,"
edgarallanpoe,"does not exist, some of the New York papers copied “Hans Pfaall,” and"
edgarallanpoe,"collated it with the “Moon-Hoax,” by way of detecting the writer of the"
edgarallanpoe,one in the writer of the other.
edgarallanpoe,As many more persons were actually gulled by the “Moon-Hoax” than would
edgarallanpoe,"be willing to acknowledge the fact, it may here afford some little"
edgarallanpoe,amusement to show why no one should have been deceived-to point out
edgarallanpoe,those particulars of the story which should have been sufficient to
edgarallanpoe,"establish its real character. Indeed, however rich the imagination"
edgarallanpoe,"displayed in this ingenious fiction, it wanted much of the force which"
edgarallanpoe,might have been given it by a more scrupulous attention to facts and
edgarallanpoe,"to general analogy. That the public were misled, even for an instant,"
edgarallanpoe,merely proves the gross ignorance which is so generally prevalent upon
edgarallanpoe,subjects of an astronomical nature.
edgarallanpoe,"The moon’s distance from the earth is, in round numbers, 240,000 miles."
edgarallanpoe,"If we desire to ascertain how near, apparently, a lens would bring the"
edgarallanpoe,"satellite (or any distant object), we, of course, have but to divide the"
edgarallanpoe,"distance by the magnifying or, more strictly, by the space-penetrating"
edgarallanpoe,"power of the glass. Mr. L. makes his lens have a power of 42,000 times."
edgarallanpoe,"By this divide 240,000 (the moon’s real distance), and we have five"
edgarallanpoe,"miles and five sevenths, as the apparent distance. No animal at all"
edgarallanpoe,could be seen so far; much less the minute points particularized in the
edgarallanpoe,story. Mr. L. speaks about Sir John Herschel’s perceiving flowers (the
edgarallanpoe,"Papaver rheas, etc.), and even detecting the color and the shape of the"
edgarallanpoe,"eyes of small birds. Shortly before, too, he has himself observed that"
edgarallanpoe,the lens would not render perceptible objects of less than eighteen
edgarallanpoe,"inches in diameter; but even this, as I have said, is giving the glass"
edgarallanpoe,"by far too great power. It may be observed, in passing, that this"
edgarallanpoe,prodigious glass is said to have been molded at the glasshouse of
edgarallanpoe,"Messrs. Hartley and Grant, in Dumbarton; but Messrs. H. and G.’s"
edgarallanpoe,establishment had ceased operations for many years previous to the
edgarallanpoe,publication of the hoax.
edgarallanpoe,"On page 13, pamphlet edition, speaking of “a hairy veil” over the eyes"
edgarallanpoe,"of a species of bison, the author says: “It immediately occurred to the"
edgarallanpoe,acute mind of Dr. Herschel that this was a providential contrivance
edgarallanpoe,to protect the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light
edgarallanpoe,and darkness to which all the inhabitants of our side of the moon are
edgarallanpoe,periodically subjected.” But this cannot be thought a very “acute”
edgarallanpoe,observation of the Doctor’s. The inhabitants of our side of the moon
edgarallanpoe,"have, evidently, no darkness at all, so there can be nothing of the"
edgarallanpoe,“extremes” mentioned. In the absence of the sun they have a light from
edgarallanpoe,the earth equal to that of thirteen full unclouded moons.
edgarallanpoe,"The topography throughout, even when professing to accord with Blunt’s"
edgarallanpoe,"Lunar Chart, is entirely at variance with that or any other lunar chart,"
edgarallanpoe,"and even grossly at variance with itself. The points of the compass,"
edgarallanpoe,"too, are in inextricable confusion; the writer appearing to be ignorant"
edgarallanpoe,"that, on a lunar map, these are not in accordance with terrestrial"
edgarallanpoe,"points; the east being to the left, etc."
edgarallanpoe,"Deceived, perhaps, by the vague titles, Mare Nubium, Mare"
edgarallanpoe,"Tranquillitatis, Mare Faecunditatis, etc., given to the dark spots by"
edgarallanpoe,"former astronomers, Mr. L. has entered into details regarding oceans"
edgarallanpoe,and other large bodies of water in the moon; whereas there is no
edgarallanpoe,astronomical point more positively ascertained than that no such bodies
edgarallanpoe,exist there. In examining the boundary between light and darkness (in
edgarallanpoe,the crescent or gibbous moon) where this boundary crosses any of the
edgarallanpoe,"dark places, the line of division is found to be rough and jagged; but,"
edgarallanpoe,"were these dark places liquid, it would evidently be even."
edgarallanpoe,"The description of the wings of the man-bat, on page 21, is but a"
edgarallanpoe,literal copy of Peter Wilkins’ account of the wings of his flying
edgarallanpoe,"islanders. This simple fact should have induced suspicion, at least, it"
edgarallanpoe,might be thought.
edgarallanpoe,"On page 23, we have the following: “What a prodigious influence must our"
edgarallanpoe,thirteen times larger globe have exercised upon this satellite when an
edgarallanpoe,"embryo in the womb of time, the passive subject of chemical affinity!”"
edgarallanpoe,This is very fine; but it should be observed that no astronomer would
edgarallanpoe,"have made such remark, especially to any journal of Science; for the"
edgarallanpoe,"earth, in the sense intended, is not only thirteen, but forty-nine times"
edgarallanpoe,larger than the moon. A similar objection applies to the whole of the
edgarallanpoe,"concluding pages, where, by way of introduction to some discoveries in"
edgarallanpoe,"Saturn, the philosophical correspondent enters into a minute schoolboy"
edgarallanpoe,account of that planet--this to the “Edinburgh journal of Science!”
edgarallanpoe,"But there is one point, in particular, which should have betrayed the"
edgarallanpoe,fiction. Let us imagine the power actually possessed of seeing animals
edgarallanpoe,upon the moon’s surface--what would first arrest the attention of an
edgarallanpoe,"observer from the earth? Certainly neither their shape, size, nor any"
edgarallanpoe,"other such peculiarity, so soon as their remarkable _situation_. They"
edgarallanpoe,"would appear to be walking, with heels up and head down, in the manner"
edgarallanpoe,of flies on a ceiling. The _real_ observer would have uttered an instant
edgarallanpoe,ejaculation of surprise (however prepared by previous knowledge) at the
edgarallanpoe,singularity of their position; the _fictitious_ observer has not even
edgarallanpoe,"mentioned the subject, but speaks of seeing the entire bodies of such"
edgarallanpoe,"creatures, when it is demonstrable that he could have seen only the"
edgarallanpoe,diameter of their heads!
edgarallanpoe,"It might as well be remarked, in conclusion, that the size, and"
edgarallanpoe,"particularly the powers of the man-bats (for example, their ability to"
edgarallanpoe,"fly in so rare an atmosphere--if, indeed, the moon have any), with most"
edgarallanpoe,"of the other fancies in regard to animal and vegetable existence, are at"
edgarallanpoe,"variance, generally, with all analogical reasoning on these themes; and"
edgarallanpoe,"that analogy here will often amount to conclusive demonstration. It is,"
edgarallanpoe,"perhaps, scarcely necessary to add, that all the suggestions attributed"
edgarallanpoe,"to Brewster and Herschel, in the beginning of the article, about “a"
edgarallanpoe,"transfusion of artificial light through the focal object of vision,”"
edgarallanpoe,"etc., etc., belong to that species of figurative writing which comes,"
edgarallanpoe,"most properly, under the denomination of rigmarole."
edgarallanpoe,There is a real and very definite limit to optical discovery among the
edgarallanpoe,"stars--a limit whose nature need only be stated to be understood. If,"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed, the casting of large lenses were all that is required, man’s"
edgarallanpoe,"ingenuity would ultimately prove equal to the task, and we might have"
edgarallanpoe,"them of any size demanded. But, unhappily, in proportion to the increase"
edgarallanpoe,"of size in the lens, and consequently of space-penetrating power, is the"
edgarallanpoe,"diminution of light from the object, by diffusion of its rays. And for"
edgarallanpoe,this evil there is no remedy within human ability; for an object is seen
edgarallanpoe,"by means of that light alone which proceeds from itself, whether direct"
edgarallanpoe,or reflected. Thus the only “artificial” light which could avail
edgarallanpoe,"Mr. Locke, would be some artificial light which he should be able to"
edgarallanpoe,"throw-not upon the “focal object of vision,” but upon the real object"
edgarallanpoe,"to be viewed-to wit: upon the moon. It has been easily calculated that,"
edgarallanpoe,when the light proceeding from a star becomes so diffused as to be as
edgarallanpoe,"weak as the natural light proceeding from the whole of the stars, in"
edgarallanpoe,"a clear and moonless night, then the star is no longer visible for any"
edgarallanpoe,practical purpose.
edgarallanpoe,"The Earl of Ross’s telescope, lately constructed in England, has"
edgarallanpoe,"a _speculum_ with a reflecting surface of 4,071 square inches; the"
edgarallanpoe,"Herschel telescope having one of only 1,811. The metal of the Earl of"
edgarallanpoe,"Ross’s is 6 feet diameter; it is 5 1/2 inches thick at the edges, and 5"
edgarallanpoe,at the centre. The weight is 3 tons. The focal length is 50 feet.
edgarallanpoe,"I have lately read a singular and somewhat ingenious little book, whose"
edgarallanpoe,title-page runs thus: “L’Homme dans la lvne ou le Voyage Chimerique
edgarallanpoe,"fait au Monde de la Lvne, nouellement decouvert par Dominique Gonzales,"
edgarallanpoe,"Aduanturier Espagnol, autrem?t dit le Courier volant. Mis en notre"
edgarallanpoe,"langve par J. B. D. A. Paris, chez Francois Piot, pres la Fontaine de"
edgarallanpoe,"Saint Benoist. Et chez J. Goignard, au premier pilier de la grand’salle"
edgarallanpoe,"du Palais, proche les Consultations, MDCXLVII.” Pp. 76."
edgarallanpoe,The writer professes to have translated his work from the English of one
edgarallanpoe,Mr. D’Avisson (Davidson?) although there is a terrible ambiguity in the
edgarallanpoe,"statement. “J’ en ai eu,” says he “l’original de Monsieur D’Avisson,"
edgarallanpoe,medecin des mieux versez qui soient aujourd’huy dans la cõnoissance des
edgarallanpoe,"Belles Lettres, et sur tout de la Philosophic Naturelle. Je lui ai cette"
edgarallanpoe,"obligation entre les autres, de m’ auoir non seulement mis en main"
edgarallanpoe,"cc Livre en anglois, mais encore le Manuscrit du Sieur Thomas D’Anan,"
edgarallanpoe,"gentilhomme Eccossois, recommandable pour sa vertu, sur la version"
edgarallanpoe,duquel j’ advoue que j’ ay tiré le plan de la mienne.”
edgarallanpoe,"After some irrelevant adventures, much in the manner of Gil Blas, and"
edgarallanpoe,"which occupy the first thirty pages, the author relates that, being"
edgarallanpoe,"ill during a sea voyage, the crew abandoned him, together with a"
edgarallanpoe,"negro servant, on the island of St. Helena. To increase the chances of"
edgarallanpoe,"obtaining food, the two separate, and live as far apart as possible."
edgarallanpoe,"This brings about a training of birds, to serve the purpose of"
edgarallanpoe,carrier-pigeons between them. By and by these are taught to carry
edgarallanpoe,parcels of some weight-and this weight is gradually increased. At length
edgarallanpoe,the idea is entertained of uniting the force of a great number of the
edgarallanpoe,"birds, with a view to raising the author himself. A machine is contrived"
edgarallanpoe,"for the purpose, and we have a minute description of it, which is"
edgarallanpoe,materially helped out by a steel engraving. Here we perceive the
edgarallanpoe,"Signor Gonzales, with point ruffles and a huge periwig, seated astride"
edgarallanpoe,"something which resembles very closely a broomstick, and borne aloft by"
edgarallanpoe,a multitude of wild swans _(ganzas) _who had strings reaching from their
edgarallanpoe,tails to the machine.
edgarallanpoe,The main event detailed in the Signor’s narrative depends upon a very
edgarallanpoe,"important fact, of which the reader is kept in ignorance until near the"
edgarallanpoe,"end of the book. The _ganzas, _with whom he had become so familiar, were"
edgarallanpoe,"not really denizens of St. Helena, but of the moon. Thence it had been"
edgarallanpoe,"their custom, time out of mind, to migrate annually to some portion of"
edgarallanpoe,"the earth. In proper season, of course, they would return home; and"
edgarallanpoe,"the author, happening, one day, to require their services for a short"
edgarallanpoe,"voyage, is unexpectedly carried straight tip, and in a very brief period"
edgarallanpoe,"arrives at the satellite. Here he finds, among other odd things, that"
edgarallanpoe,the people enjoy extreme happiness; that they have no _law; _that they
edgarallanpoe,die without pain; that they are from ten to thirty feet in height;
edgarallanpoe,that they live five thousand years; that they have an emperor called
edgarallanpoe,"Irdonozur; and that they can jump sixty feet high, when, being out of"
edgarallanpoe,"the gravitating influence, they fly about with fans."
edgarallanpoe,I cannot forbear giving a specimen of the general _philosophy _of the
edgarallanpoe,volume.
edgarallanpoe,"“I must not forget here, that the stars appeared only on that side of"
edgarallanpoe,"the globe turned toward the moon, and that the closer they were to it"
edgarallanpoe,the larger they seemed. I have also me and the earth. As to the
edgarallanpoe,"stars, _since there was no night where I was, they always had the same"
edgarallanpoe,"appearance; not brilliant, as usual, but pale, and very nearly like the"
edgarallanpoe,"moon of a morning. _But few of them were visible, and these ten times"
edgarallanpoe,larger (as well as I could judge) than they seem to the inhabitants
edgarallanpoe,"of the earth. The moon, which wanted two days of being full, was of a"
edgarallanpoe,terrible bigness.
edgarallanpoe,"“I must not forget here, that the stars appeared only on that side"
edgarallanpoe,"of the globe turned toward the moon, and that the closer they were to it"
edgarallanpoe,"the larger they seemed. I have also to inform you that, whether it was"
edgarallanpoe,"calm weather or stormy, I found myself _always immediately between the"
edgarallanpoe,moon and the earth._ I_ _was convinced of this for two reasons-because
edgarallanpoe,my birds always flew in a straight line; and because whenever we
edgarallanpoe,"attempted to rest, _we were carried insensibly around the globe of the"
edgarallanpoe,"earth. _For I admit the opinion of Copernicus, who maintains that it"
edgarallanpoe,"never ceases to revolve _from the east to the west, _not upon the poles"
edgarallanpoe,"of the Equinoctial, commonly called the poles of the world, but upon"
edgarallanpoe,"those of the Zodiac, a question of which I propose to speak more at"
edgarallanpoe,"length here-after, when I shall have leisure to refresh my memory in"
edgarallanpoe,"regard to the astrology which I learned at Salamanca when young, and"
edgarallanpoe,have since forgotten.”
edgarallanpoe,"Notwithstanding the blunders italicized, the book is not without"
edgarallanpoe,"some claim to attention, as affording a naive specimen of the current"
edgarallanpoe,"astronomical notions of the time. One of these assumed, that the"
edgarallanpoe,“gravitating power” extended but a short distance from the earth’s
edgarallanpoe,"surface, and, accordingly, we find our voyager “carried insensibly"
edgarallanpoe,"around the globe,” etc."
edgarallanpoe,"There have been other “voyages to the moon,” but none of higher merit"
edgarallanpoe,than the one just mentioned. That of Bergerac is utterly meaningless. In
edgarallanpoe,the third volume of the “American Quarterly Review” will be found
edgarallanpoe,quite an elaborate criticism upon a certain “journey” of the kind in
edgarallanpoe,question--a criticism in which it is difficult to say whether the critic
edgarallanpoe,"most exposes the stupidity of the book, or his own absurd ignorance of"
edgarallanpoe,astronomy. I forget the title of the work; but the _means _of the voyage
edgarallanpoe,are more deplorably ill conceived than are even the _ganzas _of our
edgarallanpoe,"friend the Signor Gonzales. The adventurer, in digging the earth,"
edgarallanpoe,happens to discover a peculiar metal for which the moon has a strong
edgarallanpoe,"attraction, and straightway constructs of it a box, which, when cast"
edgarallanpoe,"loose from its terrestrial fastenings, flies with him, forthwith, to"
edgarallanpoe,"the satellite. The “Flight of Thomas O’Rourke,” is a _jeu d’ esprit _not"
edgarallanpoe,"altogether contemptible, and has been translated into German. Thomas,"
edgarallanpoe,"the hero, was, in fact, the gamekeeper of an Irish peer, whose"
edgarallanpoe,eccentricities gave rise to the tale. The “flight” is made on an eagle’s
edgarallanpoe,"back, from Hungry Hill, a lofty mountain at the end of Bantry Bay."
edgarallanpoe,In these various _brochures _the aim is always satirical; the theme
edgarallanpoe,being a description of Lunarian customs as compared with ours. In none
edgarallanpoe,is there any effort at _plausibility _in the details of the voyage
edgarallanpoe,"itself. The writers seem, in each instance, to be utterly uninformed in"
edgarallanpoe,"respect to astronomy. In “Hans Pfaall” the design is original, inasmuch"
edgarallanpoe,"as regards an attempt at _verisimilitude, _in the application of"
edgarallanpoe,scientific principles (so far as the whimsical nature of the subject
edgarallanpoe,"would permit), to the actual passage between the earth and the moon."
edgarallanpoe,(*2) The zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called Trabes.
edgarallanpoe,"Emicant Trabes quos docos vocant.--Pliny, lib. 2, p. 26."
edgarallanpoe,"(*3) Since the original publication of Hans Pfaall, I find that Mr."
edgarallanpoe,"Green, of Nassau balloon notoriety, and other late aeronauts, deny"
edgarallanpoe,"the assertions of Humboldt, in this respect, and speak of a decreasing"
edgarallanpoe,"inconvenience,--precisely in accordance with the theory here urged in a"
edgarallanpoe,mere spirit of banter.
edgarallanpoe,"(*4) Havelius writes that he has several times found, in skies"
edgarallanpoe,"perfectly clear, when even stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude"
edgarallanpoe,"were conspicuous, that, at the same altitude of the moon, at the"
edgarallanpoe,"same elongation from the earth, and with one and the same excellent"
edgarallanpoe,"telescope, the moon and its maculae did not appear equally lucid at all"
edgarallanpoe,"times. From the circumstances of the observation, it is evident that the"
edgarallanpoe,"cause of this phenomenon is not either in our air, in the tube, in"
edgarallanpoe,"the moon, or in the eye of the spectator, but must be looked for in"
edgarallanpoe,something (an atmosphere?) existing about the moon.
edgarallanpoe,THE GOLD-BUG
edgarallanpoe,What ho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad!
edgarallanpoe,He hath been bitten by the Tarantula.
edgarallanpoe,_--All in the Wrong._
edgarallanpoe,"MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William Legrand."
edgarallanpoe,"He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but"
edgarallanpoe,a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want. To avoid the
edgarallanpoe,"mortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the"
edgarallanpoe,"city of his forefathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan’s Island,"
edgarallanpoe,"near Charleston, South Carolina. This Island is a very singular one."
edgarallanpoe,"It consists of little else than the sea sand, and is about three"
edgarallanpoe,miles long. Its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. It is
edgarallanpoe,"separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its"
edgarallanpoe,"way through a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the"
edgarallanpoe,"marsh hen. The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least"
edgarallanpoe,dwarfish. No trees of any magnitude are to be seen. Near the western
edgarallanpoe,"extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable"
edgarallanpoe,"frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives from"
edgarallanpoe,"Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto;"
edgarallanpoe,"but the whole island, with the exception of this western point, and"
edgarallanpoe,"a line of hard, white beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense"
edgarallanpoe,"undergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists"
edgarallanpoe,of England. The shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty
edgarallanpoe,"feet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with"
edgarallanpoe,its fragrance.
edgarallanpoe,"In the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or more"
edgarallanpoe,"remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which"
edgarallanpoe,"he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his acquaintance."
edgarallanpoe,This soon ripened into friendship--for there was much in the recluse
edgarallanpoe,"to excite interest and esteem. I found him well educated, with unusual"
edgarallanpoe,"powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse"
edgarallanpoe,moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy. He had with him many
edgarallanpoe,"books, but rarely employed them. His chief amusements were gunning and"
edgarallanpoe,"fishing, or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in quest"
edgarallanpoe,of shells or entomological specimens;--his collection of the latter
edgarallanpoe,might have been envied by a Swammerdamm. In these excursions he was
edgarallanpoe,"usually accompanied by an old negro, called Jupiter, who had been"
edgarallanpoe,"manumitted before the reverses of the family, but who could be induced,"
edgarallanpoe,"neither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what he considered his"
edgarallanpoe,right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young “Massa Will.” It
edgarallanpoe,"is not improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be"
edgarallanpoe,"somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy"
edgarallanpoe,"into Jupiter, with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the"
edgarallanpoe,wanderer.
edgarallanpoe,"The winters in the latitude of Sullivan’s Island are seldom very severe,"
edgarallanpoe,and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is
edgarallanpoe,"considered necessary. About the middle of October, 18-, there occurred,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, a day of remarkable chilliness. Just before sunset I scrambled"
edgarallanpoe,"my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I had"
edgarallanpoe,"not visited for several weeks--my residence being, at that time,"
edgarallanpoe,"in Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the Island, while the"
edgarallanpoe,facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of
edgarallanpoe,"the present day. Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom,"
edgarallanpoe,"and getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted,"
edgarallanpoe,unlocked the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth.
edgarallanpoe,"It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I threw off an"
edgarallanpoe,"overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently"
edgarallanpoe,the arrival of my hosts.
edgarallanpoe,"Soon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome."
edgarallanpoe,"Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some"
edgarallanpoe,marsh-hens for supper. Legrand was in one of his fits--how else shall
edgarallanpoe,"I term them?--of enthusiasm. He had found an unknown bivalve, forming"
edgarallanpoe,"a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured, with"
edgarallanpoe,"Jupiter’s assistance, a scarabæus which he believed to be totally new,"
edgarallanpoe,but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow.
edgarallanpoe,"“And why not to-night?” I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and"
edgarallanpoe,wishing the whole tribe of scarabæi at the devil.
edgarallanpoe,"“Ah, if I had only known you were here!” said Legrand, “but it’s so long"
edgarallanpoe,since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a visit
edgarallanpoe,this very night of all others? As I was coming home I met Lieutenant
edgarallanpoe,"G--, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will"
edgarallanpoe,"be impossible for you to see it until the morning. Stay here to-night,"
edgarallanpoe,and I will send Jup down for it at sunrise. It is the loveliest thing in
edgarallanpoe,creation!”
edgarallanpoe,“What?--sunrise?”
edgarallanpoe,“Nonsense! no!--the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color--about the size
edgarallanpoe,of a large hickory-nut--with two jet black spots near one extremity of
edgarallanpoe,"the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other. The antennæ are--”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Dey aint no tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,” here"
edgarallanpoe,"interrupted Jupiter; “de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery bit of him,"
edgarallanpoe,"inside and all, sep him wing--neber feel half so hebby a bug in my"
edgarallanpoe,life.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Well, suppose it is, Jup,” replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly,"
edgarallanpoe,"it seemed to me, than the case demanded, “is that any reason for your"
edgarallanpoe,letting the birds burn? The color”--here he turned to me--“is really
edgarallanpoe,almost enough to warrant Jupiter’s idea. You never saw a more brilliant
edgarallanpoe,metallic lustre than the scales emit--but of this you cannot judge
edgarallanpoe,till tomorrow. In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape.”
edgarallanpoe,"Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and"
edgarallanpoe,"ink, but no paper. He looked for some in a drawer, but found none."
edgarallanpoe,"“Never mind,” said he at length, “this will answer;” and he drew from"
edgarallanpoe,"his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap,"
edgarallanpoe,"and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen. While he did this, I"
edgarallanpoe,"retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly. When the design"
edgarallanpoe,"was complete, he handed it to me without rising. As I received it, a"
edgarallanpoe,"loud growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door. Jupiter"
edgarallanpoe,"opened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in,"
edgarallanpoe,"leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown"
edgarallanpoe,"him much attention during previous visits. When his gambols were over, I"
edgarallanpoe,"looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little"
edgarallanpoe,puzzled at what my friend had depicted.
edgarallanpoe,"“Well!” I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, “this is a"
edgarallanpoe,"strange scarabæus, I must confess: new to me: never saw anything like it"
edgarallanpoe,"before--unless it was a skull, or a death’s-head--which it more nearly"
edgarallanpoe,resembles than anything else that has come under my observation.”
edgarallanpoe,"“A death’s-head!” echoed Legrand--“Oh--yes--well, it has something of"
edgarallanpoe,"that appearance upon paper, no doubt. The two upper black spots look"
edgarallanpoe,"like eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth--and then"
edgarallanpoe,the shape of the whole is oval.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Perhaps so,” said I; “but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. I must"
edgarallanpoe,"wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its"
edgarallanpoe,personal appearance.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Well, I don’t know,” said he, a little nettled, “I draw"
edgarallanpoe,"tolerably--should do it at least--have had good masters, and flatter"
edgarallanpoe,myself that I am not quite a blockhead.”
edgarallanpoe,"“But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,” said I, “this is a very"
edgarallanpoe,"passable skull--indeed, I may say that it is a very excellent skull,"
edgarallanpoe,according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology--and
edgarallanpoe,your scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus in the world if it
edgarallanpoe,"resembles it. Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition"
edgarallanpoe,"upon this hint. I presume you will call the bug scarabæus caput hominis,"
edgarallanpoe,or something of that kind--there are many similar titles in the Natural
edgarallanpoe,Histories. But where are the antennæ you spoke of?”
edgarallanpoe,"“The antennæ!” said Legrand, who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm"
edgarallanpoe,upon the subject; “I am sure you must see the antennæ. I made them
edgarallanpoe,"as distinct as they are in the original insect, and I presume that is"
edgarallanpoe,sufficient.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Well, well,” I said, “perhaps you have--still I don’t see them;” and"
edgarallanpoe,"I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to ruffle"
edgarallanpoe,his temper; but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken; his
edgarallanpoe,"ill humor puzzled me--and, as for the drawing of the beetle, there"
edgarallanpoe,"were positively no antennæ visible, and the whole did bear a very close"
edgarallanpoe,resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death’s-head.
edgarallanpoe,"He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it,"
edgarallanpoe,"apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design"
edgarallanpoe,seemed suddenly to rivet his attention. In an instant his face grew
edgarallanpoe,violently red--in another as excessively pale. For some minutes he
edgarallanpoe,continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. At length he
edgarallanpoe,"arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon"
edgarallanpoe,a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room. Here again he made an
edgarallanpoe,anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions. He said
edgarallanpoe,"nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought"
edgarallanpoe,it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any
edgarallanpoe,"comment. Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the"
edgarallanpoe,"paper carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he"
edgarallanpoe,locked. He now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air
edgarallanpoe,of enthusiasm had quite disappeared. Yet he seemed not so much sulky as
edgarallanpoe,abstracted. As the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in
edgarallanpoe,"reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him. It had been my"
edgarallanpoe,"intention to pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before,"
edgarallanpoe,"but, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave. He"
edgarallanpoe,"did not press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with"
edgarallanpoe,even more than his usual cordiality.
edgarallanpoe,It was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen
edgarallanpoe,"nothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his"
edgarallanpoe,"man, Jupiter. I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited,"
edgarallanpoe,and I feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend.
edgarallanpoe,"“Well, Jup,” said I, “what is the matter now?--how is your master?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought be.”"
edgarallanpoe,“Not well! I am truly sorry to hear it. What does he complain of?”
edgarallanpoe,“Dar! dat’s it!--him neber plain of notin--but him berry sick for all
edgarallanpoe,dat.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Very sick, Jupiter!--why didn’t you say so at once? Is he confined to"
edgarallanpoe,bed?”
edgarallanpoe,"“No, dat he aint!--he aint find nowhar--dat’s just whar de shoe"
edgarallanpoe,pinch--my mind is got to be berry hebby bout poor Massa Will.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Jupiter, I should like to understand what it is you are talking about."
edgarallanpoe,You say your master is sick. Hasn’t he told you what ails him?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Why, massa, taint worf while for to git mad about de matter--Massa"
edgarallanpoe,Will say noffin at all aint de matter wid him--but den what make him go
edgarallanpoe,"about looking dis here way, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as"
edgarallanpoe,white as a gose? And den he keep a syphon all de time--”
edgarallanpoe,"“Keeps a what, Jupiter?”"
edgarallanpoe,“Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate--de queerest figgurs I ebber
edgarallanpoe,"did see. Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you. Hab for to keep mighty"
edgarallanpoe,tight eye pon him noovers. Todder day he gib me slip fore de sun up and
edgarallanpoe,was gone de whole ob de blessed day. I had a big stick ready cut for to
edgarallanpoe,gib him deuced good beating when he did come--but Ise sich a fool dat I
edgarallanpoe,hadn’t de heart arter all--he look so berry poorly.”
edgarallanpoe,“Eh?--what?--ah yes!--upon the whole I think you had better not be too
edgarallanpoe,"severe with the poor fellow--don’t flog him, Jupiter--he can’t very well"
edgarallanpoe,"stand it--but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness,"
edgarallanpoe,or rather this change of conduct? Has anything unpleasant happened since
edgarallanpoe,I saw you?”
edgarallanpoe,"“No, massa, dey aint bin noffin unpleasant since den--‘twas fore den I’m"
edgarallanpoe,feared--‘twas de berry day you was dare.”
edgarallanpoe,“How? what do you mean?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Why, massa, I mean de bug--dare now.”"
edgarallanpoe,“The what?”
edgarallanpoe,"“De bug,--I’m berry sartain dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere bout de"
edgarallanpoe,head by dat goole-bug.”
edgarallanpoe,"“And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such a supposition?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Claws enuff, massa, and mouth too. I nebber did see sick a deuced"
edgarallanpoe,bug--he kick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him. Massa Will cotch
edgarallanpoe,"him fuss, but had for to let him go gin mighty quick, I tell you--den"
edgarallanpoe,was de time he must ha got de bite. I did n’t like de look oh de bug
edgarallanpoe,"mouff, myself, no how, so I would n’t take hold ob him wid my finger,"
edgarallanpoe,but I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. I rap him up in de
edgarallanpoe,paper and stuff piece ob it in he mouff--dat was de way.”
edgarallanpoe,"“And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the beetle,"
edgarallanpoe,and that the bite made him sick?”
edgarallanpoe,“I do n’t tink noffin about it--I nose it. What make him dream bout de
edgarallanpoe,"goole so much, if taint cause he bit by de goole-bug? Ise heerd bout dem"
edgarallanpoe,goole-bugs fore dis.”
edgarallanpoe,“But how do you know he dreams about gold?”
edgarallanpoe,“How I know? why cause he talk about it in he sleep--dat’s how I nose.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate circumstance am"
edgarallanpoe,I to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?”
edgarallanpoe,"“What de matter, massa?”"
edgarallanpoe,“Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?”
edgarallanpoe,"“No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;” and here Jupiter handed me a note"
edgarallanpoe,which ran thus:
edgarallanpoe,MY DEAR ----
edgarallanpoe,Why have I not seen you for so long a time? I hope you have not been so
edgarallanpoe,"foolish as to take offence at any little _brusquerie_ of mine; but no,"
edgarallanpoe,that is improbable. Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety.
edgarallanpoe,"I have something to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or"
edgarallanpoe,whether I should tell it at all.
edgarallanpoe,"I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup annoys"
edgarallanpoe,"me, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions Would you"
edgarallanpoe,"believe it?--he had prepared a huge stick, the other day, with which"
edgarallanpoe,"to chastise me for giving him the slip, and spending the day, _solus_,"
edgarallanpoe,among the hills on the main land. I verily believe that my ill looks
edgarallanpoe,alone saved me a flogging.
edgarallanpoe,I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.
edgarallanpoe,"If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Jupiter."
edgarallanpoe,"_Do_ come. I wish to see you to-_night_, upon business of importance. I"
edgarallanpoe,assure you that it is of the _highest_ importance.
edgarallanpoe,"Ever yours,                     WILLIAM LEGRAND."
edgarallanpoe,There was something in the tone of this note which gave me great
edgarallanpoe,uneasiness. Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand.
edgarallanpoe,What could he be dreaming of? What new crotchet possessed his excitable
edgarallanpoe,brain? What “business of the highest importance” could he possibly have
edgarallanpoe,to transact? Jupiter’s account of him boded no good. I dreaded lest the
edgarallanpoe,"continued pressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled"
edgarallanpoe,"the reason of my friend. Without a moment’s hesitation, therefore, I"
edgarallanpoe,prepared to accompany the negro.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all"
edgarallanpoe,"apparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to"
edgarallanpoe,embark.
edgarallanpoe,"“What is the meaning of all this, Jup?” I inquired."
edgarallanpoe,"“Him syfe, massa, and spade.”"
edgarallanpoe,“Very true; but what are they doing here?”
edgarallanpoe,“Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for him in
edgarallanpoe,"de town, and de debbils own lot of money I had to gib for em.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your ‘Massa Will’"
edgarallanpoe,going to do with scythes and spades?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Dat’s more dan I know, and debbil take me if I don’t blieve ‘tis more"
edgarallanpoe,"dan he know, too. But it’s all cum ob do bug.”"
edgarallanpoe,"Finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose whole"
edgarallanpoe,"intellect seemed to be absorbed by “de bug,” I now stepped into the boat"
edgarallanpoe,and made sail. With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little
edgarallanpoe,"cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some two miles"
edgarallanpoe,brought us to the hut. It was about three in the afternoon when we
edgarallanpoe,arrived. Legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation. He grasped
edgarallanpoe,my hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened
edgarallanpoe,the suspicions already entertained. His countenance was pale even to
edgarallanpoe,"ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre. After"
edgarallanpoe,"some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not knowing what"
edgarallanpoe,"better to say, if he had yet obtained the scarabæus from Lieutenant"
edgarallanpoe,G ----.
edgarallanpoe,"“Oh, yes,” he replied, coloring violently, “I got it from him the next"
edgarallanpoe,morning. Nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabæus. Do you
edgarallanpoe,know that Jupiter is quite right about it?”
edgarallanpoe,"“In what way?” I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart."
edgarallanpoe,“In supposing it to be a bug of real gold.” He said this with an air of
edgarallanpoe,"profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked."
edgarallanpoe,"“This bug is to make my fortune,” he continued, with a triumphant smile,"
edgarallanpoe,"“to reinstate me in my family possessions. Is it any wonder, then, that"
edgarallanpoe,"I prize it? Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me, I have"
edgarallanpoe,only to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of which it is
edgarallanpoe,the index. Jupiter; bring me that scarabæus!”
edgarallanpoe,"“What! de bug, massa? I’d rudder not go fer trubble dat bug--you mus git"
edgarallanpoe,"him for your own self.” Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and"
edgarallanpoe,"stately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was"
edgarallanpoe,"enclosed. It was a beautiful scarabæus, and, at that time, unknown to"
edgarallanpoe,naturalists--of course a great prize in a scientific point of view.
edgarallanpoe,"There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back, and"
edgarallanpoe,"a long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy,"
edgarallanpoe,with all the appearance of burnished gold. The weight of the insect
edgarallanpoe,"was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could"
edgarallanpoe,hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of
edgarallanpoe,"Legrand’s concordance with that opinion, I could not, for the life of"
edgarallanpoe,"me, tell."
edgarallanpoe,"“I sent for you,” said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed"
edgarallanpoe,"my examination of the beetle, “I sent for you, that I might have your"
edgarallanpoe,counsel and assistance in furthering the views of Fate and of the bug”--
edgarallanpoe,"“My dear Legrand,” I cried, interrupting him, “you are certainly unwell,"
edgarallanpoe,"and had better use some little precautions. You shall go to bed, and"
edgarallanpoe,"I will remain with you a few days, until you get over this. You are"
edgarallanpoe,feverish and”--
edgarallanpoe,"“Feel my pulse,” said he."
edgarallanpoe,"I felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication of"
edgarallanpoe,fever.
edgarallanpoe,“But you may be ill and yet have no fever. Allow me this once to
edgarallanpoe,"prescribe for you. In the first place, go to bed. In the next”--"
edgarallanpoe,"“You are mistaken,” he interposed, “I am as well as I can expect to be"
edgarallanpoe,"under the excitement which I suffer. If you really wish me well, you"
edgarallanpoe,will relieve this excitement.”
edgarallanpoe,“And how is this to be done?”
edgarallanpoe,“Very easily. Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the
edgarallanpoe,"hills, upon the main land, and, in this expedition we shall need the"
edgarallanpoe,aid of some person in whom we can confide. You are the only one we can
edgarallanpoe,"trust. Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive"
edgarallanpoe,in me will be equally allayed.”
edgarallanpoe,"“I am anxious to oblige you in any way,” I replied; “but do you mean to"
edgarallanpoe,say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition
edgarallanpoe,into the hills?”
edgarallanpoe,“It has.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding.”"
edgarallanpoe,“I am sorry--very sorry--for we shall have to try it by ourselves.”
edgarallanpoe,“Try it by yourselves! The man is surely mad!--but stay!--how long do
edgarallanpoe,you propose to be absent?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Probably all night. We shall start immediately, and be back, at all"
edgarallanpoe,"events, by sunrise.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak of yours"
edgarallanpoe,"is over, and the bug business (good God!) settled to your satisfaction,"
edgarallanpoe,"you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly, as that of"
edgarallanpoe,your physician?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to lose.”"
edgarallanpoe,With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend. We started about four
edgarallanpoe,"o’clock--Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself. Jupiter had with him the"
edgarallanpoe,scythe and spades--the whole of which he insisted upon carrying--more
edgarallanpoe,"through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements"
edgarallanpoe,"within reach of his master, than from any excess of industry or"
edgarallanpoe,"complaisance. His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and “dat deuced"
edgarallanpoe,bug” were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey. For
edgarallanpoe,"my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand"
edgarallanpoe,"contented himself with the scarabæus, which he carried attached to the"
edgarallanpoe,"end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a"
edgarallanpoe,"conjuror, as he went. When I observed this last, plain evidence of my"
edgarallanpoe,"friend’s aberration of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. I"
edgarallanpoe,"thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the present,"
edgarallanpoe,or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of
edgarallanpoe,"success. In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in"
edgarallanpoe,regard to the object of the expedition. Having succeeded in inducing
edgarallanpoe,"me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any"
edgarallanpoe,"topic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other"
edgarallanpoe,reply than “we shall see!”
edgarallanpoe,"We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff; and,"
edgarallanpoe,"ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land, proceeded in a"
edgarallanpoe,"northwesterly direction, through a tract of country excessively wild and"
edgarallanpoe,"desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen. Legrand led"
edgarallanpoe,"the way with decision; pausing only for an instant, here and there, to"
edgarallanpoe,consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance
edgarallanpoe,upon a former occasion.
edgarallanpoe,"In this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just"
edgarallanpoe,setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet
edgarallanpoe,"seen. It was a species of table land, near the summit of an almost"
edgarallanpoe,"inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and"
edgarallanpoe,"interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil,"
edgarallanpoe,and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the
edgarallanpoe,"valleys below, merely by the support of the trees against which they"
edgarallanpoe,"reclined. Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air of still"
edgarallanpoe,sterner solemnity to the scene.
edgarallanpoe,The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown
edgarallanpoe,"with brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have"
edgarallanpoe,"been impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by"
edgarallanpoe,"direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of"
edgarallanpoe,"an enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks,"
edgarallanpoe,"upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I"
edgarallanpoe,"had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide"
edgarallanpoe,"spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance."
edgarallanpoe,"When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if"
edgarallanpoe,he thought he could climb it. The old man seemed a little staggered
edgarallanpoe,"by the question, and for some moments made no reply. At length he"
edgarallanpoe,"approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with"
edgarallanpoe,"minute attention. When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,"
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too dark to"
edgarallanpoe,see what we are about.”
edgarallanpoe,"“How far mus go up, massa?” inquired Jupiter."
edgarallanpoe,"“Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way to"
edgarallanpoe,go--and here--stop! take this beetle with you.”
edgarallanpoe,"“De bug, Massa Will!--de goole bug!” cried the negro, drawing back in"
edgarallanpoe,dismay--“what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?--d-n if I do!”
edgarallanpoe,"“If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of"
edgarallanpoe,"a harmless little dead beetle, why you can carry it up by this"
edgarallanpoe,"string--but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall be"
edgarallanpoe,under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel.”
edgarallanpoe,"“What de matter now, massa?” said Jup, evidently shamed into compliance;"
edgarallanpoe,“always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger. Was only funnin any how.
edgarallanpoe,Me feered de bug! what I keer for de bug?” Here he took cautiously hold
edgarallanpoe,"of the extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the insect as far"
edgarallanpoe,"from his person as circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the"
edgarallanpoe,tree.
edgarallanpoe,"In youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron Tulipferum, the most"
edgarallanpoe,"magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and"
edgarallanpoe,"often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its"
edgarallanpoe,"riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs"
edgarallanpoe,"make their appearance on the stem. Thus the difficulty of ascension, in"
edgarallanpoe,"the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality. Embracing the"
edgarallanpoe,"huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing"
edgarallanpoe,"with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon"
edgarallanpoe,"others, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length"
edgarallanpoe,"wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to consider the"
edgarallanpoe,whole business as virtually accomplished. The risk of the achievement
edgarallanpoe,"was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy"
edgarallanpoe,feet from the ground.
edgarallanpoe,"“Which way mus go now, Massa Will?” he asked."
edgarallanpoe,"“Keep up the largest branch--the one on this side,” said Legrand. The"
edgarallanpoe,"negro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble;"
edgarallanpoe,"ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure could"
edgarallanpoe,be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it. Presently his
edgarallanpoe,voice was heard in a sort of halloo.
edgarallanpoe,“How much fudder is got for go?”
edgarallanpoe,“How high up are you?” asked Legrand.
edgarallanpoe,"“Ebber so fur,” replied the negro; “can see de sky fru de top ob de"
edgarallanpoe,tree.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say. Look down the trunk and"
edgarallanpoe,count the limbs below you on this side. How many limbs have you passed?”
edgarallanpoe,"“One, two, tree, four, fibe--I done pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis"
edgarallanpoe,side.”
edgarallanpoe,“Then go one limb higher.”
edgarallanpoe,"In a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the seventh"
edgarallanpoe,limb was attained.
edgarallanpoe,"“Now, Jup,” cried Legrand, evidently much excited, “I want you to work"
edgarallanpoe,your way out upon that limb as far as you can. If you see anything
edgarallanpoe,"strange, let me know.” By this time what little doubt I might have"
edgarallanpoe,"entertained of my poor friend’s insanity, was put finally at rest. I had"
edgarallanpoe,"no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became"
edgarallanpoe,seriously anxious about getting him home. While I was pondering upon
edgarallanpoe,"what was best to be done, Jupiter’s voice was again heard."
edgarallanpoe,“Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry far--tis dead limb putty
edgarallanpoe,much all de way.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Did you say it was a dead limb, Jupiter?” cried Legrand in a quavering"
edgarallanpoe,voice.
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail--done up for sartain--done"
edgarallanpoe,departed dis here life.”
edgarallanpoe,"“What in the name heaven shall I do?” asked Legrand, seemingly in the"
edgarallanpoe,"greatest distress. “Do!” said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose"
edgarallanpoe,"a word, “why come home and go to bed. Come now!--that’s a fine fellow."
edgarallanpoe,"It’s getting late, and, besides, you remember your promise.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Jupiter,” cried he, without heeding me in the least, “do you hear me?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think it very"
edgarallanpoe,rotten.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,” replied the negro in a few moments, “but"
edgarallanpoe,not so berry rotten as mought be. Mought ventur out leetle way pon de
edgarallanpoe,"limb by myself, dat’s true.”"
edgarallanpoe,“By yourself!--what do you mean?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Why I mean de bug. ‘Tis berry hebby bug. Spose I drop him down fuss,"
edgarallanpoe,and den de limb won’t break wid just de weight ob one nigger.”
edgarallanpoe,"“You infernal scoundrel!” cried Legrand, apparently much relieved, “what"
edgarallanpoe,do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? As sure as you drop
edgarallanpoe,"that beetle I’ll break your neck. Look here, Jupiter, do you hear me?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes, massa, needn’t hollo at poor nigger dat style.”"
edgarallanpoe,“Well! now listen!--if you will venture out on the limb as far as you
edgarallanpoe,"think safe, and not let go the beetle, I’ll make you a present of a"
edgarallanpoe,silver dollar as soon as you get down.”
edgarallanpoe,"“I’m gwine, Massa Will--deed I is,” replied the negro very"
edgarallanpoe,promptly--“mos out to the eend now.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Out to the end!” here fairly screamed Legrand, “do you say you are out"
edgarallanpoe,to the end of that limb?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Soon be to de eend, massa,--o-o-o-o-oh! Lor-gol-a-marcy! what is dis"
edgarallanpoe,here pon de tree?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Well!” cried Legrand, highly delighted, “what is it?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Why taint noffin but a skull--somebody bin lef him head up de tree, and"
edgarallanpoe,de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.”
edgarallanpoe,"“A skull, you say!--very well!--how is it fastened to the limb?--what"
edgarallanpoe,holds it on?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Sure nuff, massa; mus look. Why dis berry curous sarcumstance, pon my"
edgarallanpoe,"word--dare’s a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob it on to de"
edgarallanpoe,tree.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Well now, Jupiter, do exactly as I tell you--do you hear?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes, massa.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Pay attention, then!--find the left eye of the skull.”"
edgarallanpoe,“Hum! hoo! dat’s good! why dare aint no eye lef at all.”
edgarallanpoe,“Curse your stupidity! do you know your right hand from your left?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes, I nose dat--nose all bout dat--tis my lef hand what I chops de"
edgarallanpoe,wood wid.”
edgarallanpoe,“To be sure! you are left-handed; and your left eye is on the same
edgarallanpoe,"side as your left hand. Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye of the"
edgarallanpoe,"skull, or the place where the left eye has been. Have you found it?”"
edgarallanpoe,"Here was a long pause. At length the negro asked,"
edgarallanpoe,"“Is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull,"
edgarallanpoe,too?--cause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all--nebber mind!
edgarallanpoe,I got de lef eye now--here de lef eye! what mus do wid it?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will reach--but"
edgarallanpoe,be careful and not let go your hold of the string.”
edgarallanpoe,"“All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de"
edgarallanpoe,hole--look out for him dare below!”
edgarallanpoe,During this colloquy no portion of Jupiter’s person could be seen; but
edgarallanpoe,"the beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the"
edgarallanpoe,"end of the string, and glistened, like a globe of burnished gold, in the"
edgarallanpoe,"last rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined"
edgarallanpoe,the eminence upon which we stood. The scarabæus hung quite clear of
edgarallanpoe,"any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our feet."
edgarallanpoe,"Legrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular"
edgarallanpoe,"space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come"
edgarallanpoe,down from the tree.
edgarallanpoe,"Driving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground, at the precise spot"
edgarallanpoe,"where the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape"
edgarallanpoe,"measure. Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk, of the"
edgarallanpoe,"tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the peg,"
edgarallanpoe,"and thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already established"
edgarallanpoe,"by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the distance of fifty"
edgarallanpoe,feet--Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe. At the spot
edgarallanpoe,"thus attained a second peg was driven, and about this, as a centre, a"
edgarallanpoe,"rude circle, about four feet in diameter, described. Taking now a spade"
edgarallanpoe,"himself, and giving one to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to"
edgarallanpoe,set about digging as quickly as possible.
edgarallanpoe,"To speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any"
edgarallanpoe,"time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have declined"
edgarallanpoe,"it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued with the"
edgarallanpoe,"exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was fearful"
edgarallanpoe,of disturbing my poor friend’s equanimity by a refusal. Could I have
edgarallanpoe,"depended, indeed, upon Jupiter’s aid, I would have had no hesitation in"
edgarallanpoe,attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was too well assured
edgarallanpoe,"of the old negro’s disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under"
edgarallanpoe,"any circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. I made no"
edgarallanpoe,doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable
edgarallanpoe,"Southern superstitions about money buried, and that his phantasy had"
edgarallanpoe,"received confirmation by the finding of the scarabæus, or, perhaps, by"
edgarallanpoe,Jupiter’s obstinacy in maintaining it to be “a bug of real gold.” A
edgarallanpoe,mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such
edgarallanpoe,suggestions--especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived
edgarallanpoe,ideas--and then I called to mind the poor fellow’s speech about the
edgarallanpoe,"beetle’s being “the index of his fortune.” Upon the whole, I was sadly"
edgarallanpoe,"vexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make a virtue of"
edgarallanpoe,"necessity--to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to convince the"
edgarallanpoe,"visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions he"
edgarallanpoe,entertained.
edgarallanpoe,"The lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy"
edgarallanpoe,"a more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and"
edgarallanpoe,"implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we"
edgarallanpoe,"composed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared"
edgarallanpoe,"to any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our"
edgarallanpoe,whereabouts.
edgarallanpoe,We dug very steadily for two hours. Little was said; and our chief
edgarallanpoe,"embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding"
edgarallanpoe,"interest in our proceedings. He, at length, became so obstreperous"
edgarallanpoe,that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in
edgarallanpoe,"the vicinity;--or, rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand;--for"
edgarallanpoe,"myself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have"
edgarallanpoe,"enabled me to get the wanderer home. The noise was, at length, very"
edgarallanpoe,"effectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a"
edgarallanpoe,"dogged air of deliberation, tied the brute’s mouth up with one of his"
edgarallanpoe,"suspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task."
edgarallanpoe,"When the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five"
edgarallanpoe,"feet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest. A general pause"
edgarallanpoe,"ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an end. Legrand,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow"
edgarallanpoe,thoughtfully and recommenced. We had excavated the entire circle of four
edgarallanpoe,"feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the"
edgarallanpoe,"farther depth of two feet. Still nothing appeared. The gold-seeker, whom"
edgarallanpoe,"I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest"
edgarallanpoe,"disappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly"
edgarallanpoe,"and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the"
edgarallanpoe,"beginning of his labor. In the mean time I made no remark. Jupiter, at a"
edgarallanpoe,"signal from his master, began to gather up his tools. This done, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in profound silence towards home."
edgarallanpoe,"We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a"
edgarallanpoe,"loud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar."
edgarallanpoe,"The astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent,"
edgarallanpoe,"let fall the spades, and fell upon his knees."
edgarallanpoe,"“You scoundrel,” said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from between"
edgarallanpoe,"his clenched teeth--“you infernal black villain!--speak, I tell"
edgarallanpoe,"you!--answer me this instant, without prevarication!--which--which is"
edgarallanpoe,your left eye?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?” roared"
edgarallanpoe,"the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right organ of vision,"
edgarallanpoe,"and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in immediate"
edgarallanpoe,dread of his master’s attempt at a gouge.
edgarallanpoe,"“I thought so!--I knew it! hurrah!” vociferated Legrand, letting the"
edgarallanpoe,"negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols, much to the"
edgarallanpoe,"astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked, mutely,"
edgarallanpoe,"from his master to myself, and then from myself to his master."
edgarallanpoe,"“Come! we must go back,” said the latter, “the game’s not up yet;” and"
edgarallanpoe,he again led the way to the tulip-tree.
edgarallanpoe,"“Jupiter,” said he, when we reached its foot, “come here! was the skull"
edgarallanpoe,"nailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face to the"
edgarallanpoe,limb?”
edgarallanpoe,"“De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good,"
edgarallanpoe,widout any trouble.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the"
edgarallanpoe,beetle?”--here Legrand touched each of Jupiter’s eyes.
edgarallanpoe,"“Twas dis eye, massa--de lef eye--jis as you tell me,” and here it was"
edgarallanpoe,his right eye that the negro indicated.
edgarallanpoe,“That will do--must try it again.”
edgarallanpoe,"Here my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw,"
edgarallanpoe,"certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot"
edgarallanpoe,"where the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward"
edgarallanpoe,"of its former position. Taking, now, the tape measure from the nearest"
edgarallanpoe,"point of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension"
edgarallanpoe,"in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated,"
edgarallanpoe,"removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had been digging."
edgarallanpoe,"Around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former"
edgarallanpoe,"instance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades."
edgarallanpoe,"I was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had occasioned"
edgarallanpoe,"the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great aversion from the"
edgarallanpoe,"labor imposed. I had become most unaccountably interested--nay, even"
edgarallanpoe,"excited. Perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant demeanor"
edgarallanpoe,"of Legrand--some air of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed"
edgarallanpoe,"me. I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking,"
edgarallanpoe,"with something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied"
edgarallanpoe,"treasure, the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion. At"
edgarallanpoe,"a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and"
edgarallanpoe,"when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again"
edgarallanpoe,"interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog. His uneasiness, in the"
edgarallanpoe,"first instance, had been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or"
edgarallanpoe,"caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone. Upon Jupiter’s"
edgarallanpoe,"again attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping"
edgarallanpoe,"into the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws. In a few"
edgarallanpoe,"seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete"
edgarallanpoe,"skeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared"
edgarallanpoe,to be the dust of decayed woollen. One or two strokes of a spade
edgarallanpoe,"upturned the blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther,"
edgarallanpoe,three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light.
edgarallanpoe,"At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but"
edgarallanpoe,the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment He
edgarallanpoe,"urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were hardly"
edgarallanpoe,"uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe of my"
edgarallanpoe,boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth.
edgarallanpoe,"We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more"
edgarallanpoe,intense excitement. During this interval we had fairly unearthed an
edgarallanpoe,"oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and"
edgarallanpoe,"wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing"
edgarallanpoe,process--perhaps that of the Bi-chloride of Mercury. This box was three
edgarallanpoe,"feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep. It"
edgarallanpoe,"was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind"
edgarallanpoe,"of open trelliswork over the whole. On each side of the chest, near the"
edgarallanpoe,"top, were three rings of iron--six in all--by means of which a firm hold"
edgarallanpoe,could be obtained by six persons. Our utmost united endeavors served
edgarallanpoe,only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed. We at once saw
edgarallanpoe,"the impossibility of removing so great a weight. Luckily, the sole"
edgarallanpoe,fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. These we drew
edgarallanpoe,"back--trembling and panting with anxiety. In an instant, a treasure of"
edgarallanpoe,incalculable value lay gleaming before us. As the rays of the lanterns
edgarallanpoe,"fell within the pit, there flashed upwards a glow and a glare, from a"
edgarallanpoe,"confused heap of gold and of jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes."
edgarallanpoe,I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed.
edgarallanpoe,"Amazement was, of course, predominant. Legrand appeared exhausted with"
edgarallanpoe,"excitement, and spoke very few words. Jupiter’s countenance wore, for"
edgarallanpoe,"some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in nature of things,"
edgarallanpoe,for any negro’s visage to assume. He seemed stupified--thunderstricken.
edgarallanpoe,"Presently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked"
edgarallanpoe,"arms up to the elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the"
edgarallanpoe,"luxury of a bath. At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a"
edgarallanpoe,"soliloquy,"
edgarallanpoe,“And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole bug! de poor little
edgarallanpoe,"goole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style! Aint you shamed ob"
edgarallanpoe,"yourself, nigger?--answer me dat!”"
edgarallanpoe,"It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet"
edgarallanpoe,"to the expediency of removing the treasure. It was growing late, and"
edgarallanpoe,"it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing housed"
edgarallanpoe,"before daylight. It was difficult to say what should be done, and much"
edgarallanpoe,"time was spent in deliberation--so confused were the ideas of all. We,"
edgarallanpoe,"finally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents,"
edgarallanpoe,"when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole. The"
edgarallanpoe,"articles taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog"
edgarallanpoe,"left to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any"
edgarallanpoe,"pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return."
edgarallanpoe,We then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in
edgarallanpoe,"safety, but after excessive toil, at one o’clock in the morning. Worn"
edgarallanpoe,"out as we were, it was not in human nature to do more immediately. We"
edgarallanpoe,"rested until two, and had supper; starting for the hills immediately"
edgarallanpoe,"afterwards, armed with three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon"
edgarallanpoe,"the premises. A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the"
edgarallanpoe,"remainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and, leaving"
edgarallanpoe,"the holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the second"
edgarallanpoe,"time, we deposited our golden burthens, just as the first faint streaks"
edgarallanpoe,of the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East.
edgarallanpoe,We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the
edgarallanpoe,time denied us repose. After an unquiet slumber of some three or four
edgarallanpoe,"hours’ duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of"
edgarallanpoe,our treasure.
edgarallanpoe,"The chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. There had"
edgarallanpoe,been nothing like order or arrangement. Every thing had been heaped
edgarallanpoe,"in promiscuously. Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves"
edgarallanpoe,possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed. In
edgarallanpoe,coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand
edgarallanpoe,"dollars--estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could,"
edgarallanpoe,by the tables of the period. There was not a particle of silver. All was
edgarallanpoe,"gold of antique date and of great variety--French, Spanish, and German"
edgarallanpoe,"money, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had"
edgarallanpoe,never seen specimens before. There were several very large and heavy
edgarallanpoe,"coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. There"
edgarallanpoe,was no American money. The value of the jewels we found more difficulty
edgarallanpoe,in estimating. There were diamonds--some of them exceedingly large and
edgarallanpoe,"fine--a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen"
edgarallanpoe,"rubies of remarkable brilliancy;--three hundred and ten emeralds, all"
edgarallanpoe,"very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. These stones had"
edgarallanpoe,all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The
edgarallanpoe,"settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold,"
edgarallanpoe,"appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent"
edgarallanpoe,"identification. Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid"
edgarallanpoe,gold ornaments;--nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings;--rich
edgarallanpoe,"chains--thirty of these, if I remember;--eighty-three very large and"
edgarallanpoe,heavy crucifixes;--five gold censers of great value;--a prodigious
edgarallanpoe,"golden punch bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and"
edgarallanpoe,"Bacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and"
edgarallanpoe,many other smaller articles which I cannot recollect. The weight of
edgarallanpoe,these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and
edgarallanpoe,in this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb
edgarallanpoe,"gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars,"
edgarallanpoe,"if one. Many of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless; the"
edgarallanpoe,"works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion--but all were richly"
edgarallanpoe,jewelled and in cases of great worth. We estimated the entire contents
edgarallanpoe,"of the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and upon"
edgarallanpoe,the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained
edgarallanpoe,"for our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the"
edgarallanpoe,"treasure. When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"intense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand,"
edgarallanpoe,who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this
edgarallanpoe,"most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the"
edgarallanpoe,circumstances connected with it.
edgarallanpoe,"“You remember;” said he, “the night when I handed you the rough sketch I"
edgarallanpoe,"had made of the scarabæus. You recollect also, that I became quite vexed"
edgarallanpoe,at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death’s-head. When you
edgarallanpoe,first made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards
edgarallanpoe,"I called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and"
edgarallanpoe,admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact.
edgarallanpoe,"Still, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me--for I am considered"
edgarallanpoe,"a good artist--and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of"
edgarallanpoe,"parchment, I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the"
edgarallanpoe,fire.”
edgarallanpoe,"“The scrap of paper, you mean,” said I."
edgarallanpoe,"“No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it"
edgarallanpoe,"to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once,"
edgarallanpoe,"to be a piece of very thin parchment. It was quite dirty, you remember."
edgarallanpoe,"Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell"
edgarallanpoe,"upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my"
edgarallanpoe,"astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure of a death’s-head"
edgarallanpoe,"just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle. For"
edgarallanpoe,a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy. I knew that my
edgarallanpoe,design was very different in detail from this--although there was a
edgarallanpoe,"certain similarity in general outline. Presently I took a candle, and"
edgarallanpoe,"seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the"
edgarallanpoe,"parchment more closely. Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch"
edgarallanpoe,"upon the reverse, just as I had made it. My first idea, now, was mere"
edgarallanpoe,surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline--at the singular
edgarallanpoe,"coincidence involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have"
edgarallanpoe,"been a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath"
edgarallanpoe,"my figure of the scarabæus, and that this skull, not only in outline,"
edgarallanpoe,"but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing. I say the"
edgarallanpoe,singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified me for a time.
edgarallanpoe,This is the usual effect of such coincidences. The mind struggles to
edgarallanpoe,"establish a connexion--a sequence of cause and effect--and, being"
edgarallanpoe,"unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis. But, when I"
edgarallanpoe,"recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction"
edgarallanpoe,which startled me even far more than the coincidence. I began
edgarallanpoe,"distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been no drawing upon"
edgarallanpoe,the parchment when I made my sketch of the scarabæus. I became perfectly
edgarallanpoe,certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then
edgarallanpoe,"the other, in search of the cleanest spot. Had the skull been then"
edgarallanpoe,"there, of course I could not have failed to notice it. Here was indeed"
edgarallanpoe,"a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early"
edgarallanpoe,"moment, there seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and"
edgarallanpoe,"secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of"
edgarallanpoe,that truth which last night’s adventure brought to so magnificent a
edgarallanpoe,"demonstration. I arose at once, and putting the parchment securely away,"
edgarallanpoe,dismissed all farther reflection until I should be alone.
edgarallanpoe,"“When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself"
edgarallanpoe,to a more methodical investigation of the affair. In the first place
edgarallanpoe,I considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my
edgarallanpoe,possession. The spot where we discovered the scarabaeus was on the coast
edgarallanpoe,"of the main land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short"
edgarallanpoe,"distance above high water mark. Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a"
edgarallanpoe,"sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop. Jupiter, with his accustomed"
edgarallanpoe,"caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked"
edgarallanpoe,"about him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold"
edgarallanpoe,"of it. It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to be paper. It was lying half"
edgarallanpoe,"buried in the sand, a corner sticking up. Near the spot where we found"
edgarallanpoe,"it, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a"
edgarallanpoe,ship’s long boat. The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great
edgarallanpoe,while; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.
edgarallanpoe,"“Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and"
edgarallanpoe,"gave it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met"
edgarallanpoe,"Lieutenant G-. I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him"
edgarallanpoe,"take it to the fort. Upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his"
edgarallanpoe,"waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped,"
edgarallanpoe,and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection.
edgarallanpoe,"Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure"
edgarallanpoe,of the prize at once--you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects
edgarallanpoe,"connected with Natural History. At the same time, without being"
edgarallanpoe,"conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket."
edgarallanpoe,"“You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making"
edgarallanpoe,"a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept."
edgarallanpoe,"I looked in the drawer, and found none there. I searched my pockets,"
edgarallanpoe,"hoping to find an old letter, when my hand fell upon the parchment. I"
edgarallanpoe,thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession; for
edgarallanpoe,the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.
edgarallanpoe,“No doubt you will think me fanciful--but I had already established a
edgarallanpoe,kind of connexion. I had put together two links of a great chain. There
edgarallanpoe,"was a boat lying upon a sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a"
edgarallanpoe,"parchment--not a paper--with a skull depicted upon it. You will,"
edgarallanpoe,"of course, ask ‘where is the connexion?’ I reply that the skull, or"
edgarallanpoe,"death’s-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. The flag of the"
edgarallanpoe,death’s head is hoisted in all engagements.
edgarallanpoe,"“I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper. Parchment"
edgarallanpoe,is durable--almost imperishable. Matters of little moment are rarely
edgarallanpoe,"consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing"
edgarallanpoe,"or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. This reflection"
edgarallanpoe,suggested some meaning--some relevancy--in the death’s-head. I did not
edgarallanpoe,"fail to observe, also, the form of the parchment. Although one of its"
edgarallanpoe,"corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the"
edgarallanpoe,"original form was oblong. It was just such a slip, indeed, as might"
edgarallanpoe,have been chosen for a memorandum--for a record of something to be long
edgarallanpoe,remembered and carefully preserved.”
edgarallanpoe,"“But,” I interposed, “you say that the skull was not upon the parchment"
edgarallanpoe,when you made the drawing of the beetle. How then do you trace any
edgarallanpoe,"connexion between the boat and the skull--since this latter, according"
edgarallanpoe,"to your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows how or by"
edgarallanpoe,whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabæus?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this"
edgarallanpoe,"point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. My steps were"
edgarallanpoe,"sure, and could afford but a single result. I reasoned, for example,"
edgarallanpoe,"thus: When I drew the scarabæus, there was no skull apparent upon"
edgarallanpoe,"the parchment. When I had completed the drawing I gave it to you, and"
edgarallanpoe,"observed you narrowly until you returned it. You, therefore, did not"
edgarallanpoe,"design the skull, and no one else was present to do it. Then it was not"
edgarallanpoe,done by human agency. And nevertheless it was done.
edgarallanpoe,"“At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and did"
edgarallanpoe,"remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about"
edgarallanpoe,the period in question. The weather was chilly (oh rare and happy
edgarallanpoe,"accident!), and a fire was blazing upon the hearth. I was heated with"
edgarallanpoe,"exercise and sat near the table. You, however, had drawn a chair close"
edgarallanpoe,"to the chimney. Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you"
edgarallanpoe,"were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered,"
edgarallanpoe,and leaped upon your shoulders. With your left hand you caressed him and
edgarallanpoe,"kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to"
edgarallanpoe,"fall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire."
edgarallanpoe,"At one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to"
edgarallanpoe,"caution you, but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were"
edgarallanpoe,"engaged in its examination. When I considered all these particulars, I"
edgarallanpoe,doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to
edgarallanpoe,"light, upon the parchment, the skull which I saw designed upon it. You"
edgarallanpoe,"are well aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time"
edgarallanpoe,"out of mind, by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper"
edgarallanpoe,"or vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when"
edgarallanpoe,"subjected to the action of fire. Zaffre, digested in aqua regia, and"
edgarallanpoe,"diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a"
edgarallanpoe,"green tint results. The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre,"
edgarallanpoe,gives a red. These colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after
edgarallanpoe,"the material written upon cools, but again become apparent upon the"
edgarallanpoe,re-application of heat.
edgarallanpoe,“I now scrutinized the death’s-head with care. Its outer edges--the
edgarallanpoe,edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum--were far more
edgarallanpoe,distinct than the others. It was clear that the action of the caloric
edgarallanpoe,"had been imperfect or unequal. I immediately kindled a fire, and"
edgarallanpoe,"subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. At first,"
edgarallanpoe,the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull;
edgarallanpoe,"but, upon persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at"
edgarallanpoe,"the corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the"
edgarallanpoe,"death’s-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to"
edgarallanpoe,"be a goat. A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended"
edgarallanpoe,for a kid.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Ha! ha!” said I, “to be sure I have no right to laugh at you--a million"
edgarallanpoe,and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth--but you are not
edgarallanpoe,about to establish a third link in your chain--you will not find any
edgarallanpoe,"especial connexion between your pirates and a goat--pirates, you know,"
edgarallanpoe,have nothing to do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest.”
edgarallanpoe,“But I have just said that the figure was not that of a goat.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Well, a kid then--pretty much the same thing.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Pretty much, but not altogether,” said Legrand. “You may have heard of"
edgarallanpoe,one Captain Kidd. I at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a
edgarallanpoe,kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature. I say signature; because
edgarallanpoe,its position upon the vellum suggested this idea. The death’s-head at
edgarallanpoe,"the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same manner, the air of a"
edgarallanpoe,"stamp, or seal. But I was sorely put out by the absence of all else--of"
edgarallanpoe,the body to my imagined instrument--of the text for my context.”
edgarallanpoe,“I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the
edgarallanpoe,signature.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Something of that kind. The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with"
edgarallanpoe,a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending. I can scarcely
edgarallanpoe,"say why. Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an actual"
edgarallanpoe,"belief;--but do you know that Jupiter’s silly words, about the bug"
edgarallanpoe,"being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect upon my fancy? And then the"
edgarallanpoe,series of accidents and coincidences--these were so very extraordinary.
edgarallanpoe,Do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have
edgarallanpoe,"occurred upon the sole day of all the year in which it has been, or may"
edgarallanpoe,"be, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without the fire, or without"
edgarallanpoe,"the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared,"
edgarallanpoe,"I should never have become aware of the death’s-head, and so never the"
edgarallanpoe,possessor of the treasure?”
edgarallanpoe,“But proceed--I am all impatience.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current--the thousand"
edgarallanpoe,"vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon the Atlantic"
edgarallanpoe,"coast, by Kidd and his associates. These rumors must have had some"
edgarallanpoe,foundation in fact. And that the rumors have existed so long and so
edgarallanpoe,"continuous, could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the"
edgarallanpoe,circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed. Had Kidd
edgarallanpoe,"concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the"
edgarallanpoe,rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form.
edgarallanpoe,"You will observe that the stories told are all about money-seekers,"
edgarallanpoe,"not about money-finders. Had the pirate recovered his money, there the"
edgarallanpoe,affair would have dropped. It seemed to me that some accident--say the
edgarallanpoe,loss of a memorandum indicating its locality--had deprived him of the
edgarallanpoe,"means of recovering it, and that this accident had become known to his"
edgarallanpoe,"followers, who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been"
edgarallanpoe,"concealed at all, and who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided"
edgarallanpoe,"attempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and then universal"
edgarallanpoe,"currency, to the reports which are now so common. Have you ever heard of"
edgarallanpoe,any important treasure being unearthed along the coast?”
edgarallanpoe,“Never.”
edgarallanpoe,"“But that Kidd’s accumulations were immense, is well known. I took it"
edgarallanpoe,"for granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you will"
edgarallanpoe,"scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly"
edgarallanpoe,"amounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found, involved"
edgarallanpoe,a lost record of the place of deposit.”
edgarallanpoe,“But how did you proceed?”
edgarallanpoe,"“I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat; but"
edgarallanpoe,nothing appeared. I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt
edgarallanpoe,might have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the
edgarallanpoe,"parchment by pouring warm water over it, and, having done this, I"
edgarallanpoe,"placed it in a tin pan, with the skull downwards, and put the pan upon"
edgarallanpoe,"a furnace of lighted charcoal. In a few minutes, the pan having become"
edgarallanpoe,"thoroughly heated, I removed the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy,"
edgarallanpoe,"found it spotted, in several places, with what appeared to be figures"
edgarallanpoe,"arranged in lines. Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to"
edgarallanpoe,"remain another minute. Upon taking it off, the whole was just as you see"
edgarallanpoe,"it now.” Here Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted it to"
edgarallanpoe,"my inspection. The following characters were rudely traced, in a red"
edgarallanpoe,"tint, between the death’s-head and the goat:"
edgarallanpoe,“53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡)4‡);806*;48†8¶60))85;1‡);:‡
edgarallanpoe,*8†83(88)5*†;46(;88*96*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†2:*‡(;4956*
edgarallanpoe,2(5*--4)8¶8*;4069285);)6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡1;4
edgarallanpoe,8†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48;(88;4(‡?34;48)4‡;161;:
edgarallanpoe,188;‡?;”
edgarallanpoe,"“But,” said I, returning him the slip, “I am as much in the dark as"
edgarallanpoe,ever. Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my solution of
edgarallanpoe,"this enigma, I am quite sure that I should be unable to earn them.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“And yet,” said Legrand, “the solution is by no means so difficult as"
edgarallanpoe,you might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the
edgarallanpoe,"characters. These characters, as any one might readily guess, form a"
edgarallanpoe,"cipher--that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what is"
edgarallanpoe,"known of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable of constructing any of"
edgarallanpoe,"the more abstruse cryptographs. I made up my mind, at once, that this"
edgarallanpoe,"was of a simple species--such, however, as would appear, to the crude"
edgarallanpoe,"intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key.”"
edgarallanpoe,“And you really solved it?”
edgarallanpoe,“Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times
edgarallanpoe,"greater. Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to"
edgarallanpoe,"take interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether human"
edgarallanpoe,ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may
edgarallanpoe,"not, by proper application, resolve. In fact, having once established"
edgarallanpoe,"connected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a thought to the mere"
edgarallanpoe,difficulty of developing their import.
edgarallanpoe,“In the present case--indeed in all cases of secret writing--the first
edgarallanpoe,question regards the language of the cipher; for the principles of
edgarallanpoe,"solution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are concerned,"
edgarallanpoe,"depend upon, and are varied by, the genius of the particular idiom."
edgarallanpoe,"In general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by"
edgarallanpoe,"probabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution,"
edgarallanpoe,"until the true one be attained. But, with the cipher now before us, all"
edgarallanpoe,difficulty was removed by the signature. The pun upon the word ‘Kidd’
edgarallanpoe,is appreciable in no other language than the English. But for this
edgarallanpoe,consideration I should have begun my attempts with the Spanish and
edgarallanpoe,"French, as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most"
edgarallanpoe,"naturally have been written by a pirate of the Spanish main. As it was,"
edgarallanpoe,I assumed the cryptograph to be English.
edgarallanpoe,“You observe there are no divisions between the words. Had there been
edgarallanpoe,"divisions, the task would have been comparatively easy. In such case"
edgarallanpoe,I should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter
edgarallanpoe,"words, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely,"
edgarallanpoe,"(a or I, for example,) I should have considered the solution as assured."
edgarallanpoe,"But, there being no division, my first step was to ascertain the"
edgarallanpoe,"predominant letters, as well as the least frequent. Counting all, I"
edgarallanpoe,"constructed a table, thus:"
edgarallanpoe,Of the character 8 there are 33.
edgarallanpoe,;        “     26.
edgarallanpoe,4        “     19.
edgarallanpoe,‡ )        “     16.
edgarallanpoe,*        “     13.
edgarallanpoe,5        “     12.
edgarallanpoe,6        “     11.
edgarallanpoe,† 1        “      8.
edgarallanpoe,0        “      6.
edgarallanpoe,9 2        “      5.
edgarallanpoe,: 3        “      4.
edgarallanpoe,?        “      3.
edgarallanpoe,¶        “      2.
edgarallanpoe,-.        “      1.
edgarallanpoe,"“Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is e."
edgarallanpoe,"Afterwards, succession runs thus: _a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k"
edgarallanpoe,p q x z_. _E_ predominates so remarkably that an individual sentence of
edgarallanpoe,"any length is rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character."
edgarallanpoe,"“Here, then, we leave, in the very beginning, the groundwork for"
edgarallanpoe,something more than a mere guess. The general use which may be made of
edgarallanpoe,"the table is obvious--but, in this particular cipher, we shall only very"
edgarallanpoe,"partially require its aid. As our predominant character is 8, we will"
edgarallanpoe,commence by assuming it as the _e_ of the natural alphabet. To verify
edgarallanpoe,"the supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples--for"
edgarallanpoe,"_e_ is doubled with great frequency in English--in such words, for"
edgarallanpoe,"example, as ‘meet,’ ‘.fleet,’ ‘speed,’ ‘seen,’ been,’ ‘agree,’ &c. In"
edgarallanpoe,"the present instance we see it doubled no less than five times, although"
edgarallanpoe,the cryptograph is brief.
edgarallanpoe,"“Let us assume 8, then, as _e_. Now, of all _words_ in the language,"
edgarallanpoe,"‘the’ is most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there are not"
edgarallanpoe,"repetitions of any three characters, in the same order of collocation,"
edgarallanpoe,"the last of them being 8. If we discover repetitions of such letters,"
edgarallanpoe,"so arranged, they will most probably represent the word ‘the.’ Upon"
edgarallanpoe,"inspection, we find no less than seven such arrangements, the characters"
edgarallanpoe,"being;48. We may, therefore, assume that; represents _t_, 4 represents"
edgarallanpoe,"_h_, and 8 represents _e_--the last being now well confirmed. Thus a"
edgarallanpoe,great step has been taken.
edgarallanpoe,"“But, having established a single word, we are enabled to establish"
edgarallanpoe,"a vastly important point; that is to say, several commencements and"
edgarallanpoe,"terminations of other words. Let us refer, for example, to the last"
edgarallanpoe,"instance but one, in which the combination;48 occurs--not far from"
edgarallanpoe,the end of the cipher. We know that the; immediately ensuing is the
edgarallanpoe,"commencement of a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this"
edgarallanpoe,"‘the,’ we are cognizant of no less than five. Let us set these"
edgarallanpoe,"characters down, thus, by the letters we know them to represent, leaving"
edgarallanpoe,a space for the unknown--
edgarallanpoe,t eeth.
edgarallanpoe,"“Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the ‘th,’ as forming no"
edgarallanpoe,"portion of the word commencing with the first t; since, by experiment"
edgarallanpoe,"of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy, we perceive"
edgarallanpoe,that no word can be formed of which this _th_ can be a part. We are thus
edgarallanpoe,narrowed into
edgarallanpoe,"t ee,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we arrive"
edgarallanpoe,"at the word ‘tree,’ as the sole possible reading. We thus gain"
edgarallanpoe,"another letter, _r_, represented by (, with the words ‘the tree’ in"
edgarallanpoe,juxtaposition.
edgarallanpoe,"“Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see"
edgarallanpoe,"the combination;48, and employ it by way of _termination_ to what"
edgarallanpoe,immediately precedes. We have thus this arrangement:
edgarallanpoe,"the tree;4(‡?34 the,"
edgarallanpoe,"or, substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus:"
edgarallanpoe,the tree thr‡?3h the.
edgarallanpoe,"“Now, if, in place of the unknown characters, we leave blank spaces, or"
edgarallanpoe,"substitute dots, we read thus:"
edgarallanpoe,"the tree thr...h the,"
edgarallanpoe,when the word ‘_through_’ makes itself evident at once. But this
edgarallanpoe,"discovery gives us three new letters, _o_, _u_ and _g_, represented by"
edgarallanpoe,‡? and 3.
edgarallanpoe,"“Looking now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of known"
edgarallanpoe,"characters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this arrangement,"
edgarallanpoe,"83(88, or egree,"
edgarallanpoe,"which, plainly, is the conclusion of the word ‘degree,’ and gives us"
edgarallanpoe,"another letter, _d_, represented by †."
edgarallanpoe,"“Four letters beyond the word ‘degree,’ we perceive the combination"
edgarallanpoe,;46(;88.
edgarallanpoe,"“Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown by dots,"
edgarallanpoe,"as before, we read thus: th rtee. an arrangement immediately suggestive"
edgarallanpoe,"of the word ‘thirteen,’ and again furnishing us with two new characters,"
edgarallanpoe,"_i_ and _n_, represented by 6 and *."
edgarallanpoe,"“Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find the"
edgarallanpoe,"combination,"
edgarallanpoe,53‡‡†.

edgarallanpoe,"represented, and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of"
edgarallanpoe,the solution. I have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this
edgarallanpoe,"nature are readily soluble, and to give you some insight into the"
edgarallanpoe,rationale of their development. But be assured that the specimen before
edgarallanpoe,us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph. It now only
edgarallanpoe,remains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the
edgarallanpoe,"parchment, as unriddled. Here it is:"
edgarallanpoe,“‘_A good glass in the bishop’s hostel in the devil’s seat forty-one
edgarallanpoe,degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh
edgarallanpoe,limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head a bee line
edgarallanpoe,from the tree through the shot fifty feet out_.’”
edgarallanpoe,"“But,” said I, “the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever."
edgarallanpoe,How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about
edgarallanpoe,"‘devil’s seats,’ ‘death’s heads,’ and ‘bishop’s hotels?’”"
edgarallanpoe,"“I confess,” replied Legrand, “that the matter still wears a serious"
edgarallanpoe,"aspect, when regarded with a casual glance. My first endeavor was"
edgarallanpoe,to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the
edgarallanpoe,cryptographist.”
edgarallanpoe,"“You mean, to punctuate it?”"
edgarallanpoe,“Something of that kind.”
edgarallanpoe,“But how was it possible to effect this?”
edgarallanpoe,“I reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words
edgarallanpoe,"together without division, so as to increase the difficulty of solution."
edgarallanpoe,"Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object would be nearly"
edgarallanpoe,"certain to overdo the matter. When, in the course of his composition, he"
edgarallanpoe,"arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause,"
edgarallanpoe,"or a point, he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters, at this"
edgarallanpoe,"place, more than usually close together. If you will observe the MS., in"
edgarallanpoe,"the present instance, you will easily detect five such cases of unusual"
edgarallanpoe,"crowding. Acting upon this hint, I made the division thus: ‘A good"
edgarallanpoe,glass in the Bishop’s hostel in the Devil’s seat--forty-one degrees and
edgarallanpoe,thirteen minutes--northeast and by north--main branch seventh limb east
edgarallanpoe,side--shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head--a bee-line from the
edgarallanpoe,tree through the shot fifty feet out.’”
edgarallanpoe,"“Even this division,” said I, “leaves me still in the dark.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“It left me also in the dark,” replied Legrand, “for a few days; during"
edgarallanpoe,"which I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivan’s Island,"
edgarallanpoe,"for any building which went by the name of the ‘Bishop’s Hotel;’ for, of"
edgarallanpoe,"course, I dropped the obsolete word ‘hostel.’ Gaining no information on"
edgarallanpoe,"the subject, I was on the point of extending my sphere of search, and"
edgarallanpoe,"proceeding in a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it entered"
edgarallanpoe,"into my head, quite suddenly, that this ‘Bishop’s Hostel’ might have"
edgarallanpoe,"some reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time out"
edgarallanpoe,"of mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about four"
edgarallanpoe,miles to the northward of the Island. I accordingly went over to the
edgarallanpoe,"plantation, and re-instituted my inquiries among the older negroes of"
edgarallanpoe,the place. At length one of the most aged of the women said that she
edgarallanpoe,"had heard of such a place as Bessop’s Castle, and thought that she could"
edgarallanpoe,"guide me to it, but that it was not a castle nor a tavern, but a high"
edgarallanpoe,rock.
edgarallanpoe,"“I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some demur,"
edgarallanpoe,she consented to accompany me to the spot. We found it without much
edgarallanpoe,"difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to examine the place. The"
edgarallanpoe,‘castle’ consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocks--one
edgarallanpoe,of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its
edgarallanpoe,"insulated and artificial appearance I clambered to its apex, and then"
edgarallanpoe,felt much at a loss as to what should be next done.
edgarallanpoe,"“While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in"
edgarallanpoe,"the eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon which"
edgarallanpoe,"I stood. This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not more"
edgarallanpoe,"than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it, gave it"
edgarallanpoe,a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our
edgarallanpoe,ancestors. I made no doubt that here was the ‘devil’s seat’ alluded to
edgarallanpoe,"in the MS., and now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle."
edgarallanpoe,"“The ‘good glass,’ I knew, could have reference to nothing but a"
edgarallanpoe,telescope; for the word ‘glass’ is rarely employed in any other sense
edgarallanpoe,"by seamen. Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used, and a"
edgarallanpoe,"definite point of view, admitting no variation, from which to use it."
edgarallanpoe,"Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, “forty-one degrees"
edgarallanpoe,"and thirteen minutes,’ and ‘northeast and by north,’ were intended as"
edgarallanpoe,directions for the levelling of the glass. Greatly excited by these
edgarallanpoe,"discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and returned to the"
edgarallanpoe,rock.
edgarallanpoe,"“I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible to"
edgarallanpoe,retain a seat upon it except in one particular position. This fact
edgarallanpoe,"confirmed my preconceived idea. I proceeded to use the glass. Of course,"
edgarallanpoe,the ‘forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes’ could allude to nothing but
edgarallanpoe,"elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was"
edgarallanpoe,"clearly indicated by the words, ‘northeast and by north.’ This latter"
edgarallanpoe,"direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then,"
edgarallanpoe,pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of forty-one degrees of
edgarallanpoe,"elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down,"
edgarallanpoe,until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the
edgarallanpoe,foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance.
edgarallanpoe,"In the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at"
edgarallanpoe,"first, distinguish what it was. Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I"
edgarallanpoe,"again looked, and now made it out to be a human skull."
edgarallanpoe,“Upon this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved;
edgarallanpoe,"for the phrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, east side,’ could refer only"
edgarallanpoe,"to the position of the skull upon the tree, while ‘shoot from the left"
edgarallanpoe,"eye of the death’s head’ admitted, also, of but one interpretation, in"
edgarallanpoe,regard to a search for buried treasure. I perceived that the design was
edgarallanpoe,"to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that a bee-line,"
edgarallanpoe,"or, in other words, a straight line, drawn from the nearest point of"
edgarallanpoe,"the trunk through ‘the shot,’ (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and"
edgarallanpoe,"thence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would indicate a definite"
edgarallanpoe,point--and beneath this point I thought it at least possible that a
edgarallanpoe,deposit of value lay concealed.”
edgarallanpoe,"“All this,” I said, “is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious,"
edgarallanpoe,"still simple and explicit. When you left the Bishop’s Hotel, what then?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned"
edgarallanpoe,"homewards. The instant that I left ‘the devil’s seat,’ however, the"
edgarallanpoe,"circular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards, turn"
edgarallanpoe,"as I would. What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business,"
edgarallanpoe,is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact) that
edgarallanpoe,the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable
edgarallanpoe,point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of
edgarallanpoe,the rock.
edgarallanpoe,“In this expedition to the ‘Bishop’s Hotel’ I had been attended
edgarallanpoe,"by Jupiter, who had, no doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the"
edgarallanpoe,"abstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me"
edgarallanpoe,"alone. But, on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived to give"
edgarallanpoe,"him the slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree. After much"
edgarallanpoe,toil I found it. When I came home at night my valet proposed to give
edgarallanpoe,me a flogging. With the rest of the adventure I believe you are as well
edgarallanpoe,acquainted as myself.”
edgarallanpoe,"“I suppose,” said I, “you missed the spot, in the first attempt at"
edgarallanpoe,"digging, through Jupiter’s stupidity in letting the bug fall through the"
edgarallanpoe,right instead of through the left eye of the skull.”
edgarallanpoe,“Precisely. This mistake made a difference of about two inches and a
edgarallanpoe,"half in the ‘shot’--that is to say, in the position of the peg nearest"
edgarallanpoe,"the tree; and had the treasure been beneath the ‘shot,’ the error would"
edgarallanpoe,"have been of little moment; but ‘the shot,’ together with the nearest"
edgarallanpoe,"point of the tree, were merely two points for the establishment of"
edgarallanpoe,"a line of direction; of course the error, however trivial in the"
edgarallanpoe,"beginning, increased as we proceeded with the line, and by the time"
edgarallanpoe,"we had gone fifty feet, threw us quite off the scent. But for my"
edgarallanpoe,deep-seated impressions that treasure was here somewhere actually
edgarallanpoe,"buried, we might have had all our labor in vain.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle--how"
edgarallanpoe,excessively odd! I was sure you were mad. And why did you insist upon
edgarallanpoe,"letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions"
edgarallanpoe,"touching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own"
edgarallanpoe,"way, by a little bit of sober mystification. For this reason I swung"
edgarallanpoe,"the beetle, and for this reason I let it fall it from the tree. An"
edgarallanpoe,observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles me. What"
edgarallanpoe,are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?”
edgarallanpoe,“That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself. There
edgarallanpoe,"seems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them--and yet"
edgarallanpoe,it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply.
edgarallanpoe,"It is clear that Kidd--if Kidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I"
edgarallanpoe,doubt not--it is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor.
edgarallanpoe,"But this labor concluded, he may have thought it expedient to remove"
edgarallanpoe,all participants in his secret. Perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock
edgarallanpoe,"were sufficient, while his coadjutors were busy in the pit; perhaps it"
edgarallanpoe,required a dozen--who shall tell?”

edgarallanpoe,--_Crebillon’s Xerxes._
edgarallanpoe,ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES is very generally looked upon as the Gog of the
edgarallanpoe,"prophet Ezekiel. This honor is, however, more properly attributable to"
edgarallanpoe,"Cambyses, the son of Cyrus. And, indeed, the character of the"
edgarallanpoe,Syrian monarch does by no means stand in need of any adventitious
edgarallanpoe,"embellishment. His accession to the throne, or rather his usurpation of"
edgarallanpoe,"the sovereignty, a hundred and seventy-one years before the coming"
edgarallanpoe,of Christ; his attempt to plunder the temple of Diana at Ephesus; his
edgarallanpoe,implacable hostility to the Jews; his pollution of the Holy of Holies;
edgarallanpoe,"and his miserable death at Taba, after a tumultuous reign of eleven"
edgarallanpoe,"years, are circumstances of a prominent kind, and therefore more"
edgarallanpoe,"generally noticed by the historians of his time than the impious,"
edgarallanpoe,"dastardly, cruel, silly, and whimsical achievements which make up the"
edgarallanpoe,sum total of his private life and reputation.
edgarallanpoe,"Let us suppose, gentle reader, that it is now the year of the world"
edgarallanpoe,"three thousand eight hundred and thirty, and let us, for a few minutes,"
edgarallanpoe,"imagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation of man, the"
edgarallanpoe,"remarkable city of Antioch. To be sure there were, in Syria and other"
edgarallanpoe,"countries, sixteen cities of that appellation, besides the one to which"
edgarallanpoe,I more particularly allude. But ours is that which went by the name of
edgarallanpoe,"Antiochia Epidaphne, from its vicinity to the little village of Daphne,"
edgarallanpoe,where stood a temple to that divinity. It was built (although about this
edgarallanpoe,"matter there is some dispute) by Seleucus Nicanor, the first king of the"
edgarallanpoe,"country after Alexander the Great, in memory of his father Antiochus,"
edgarallanpoe,and became immediately the residence of the Syrian monarchy. In the
edgarallanpoe,"flourishing times of the Roman Empire, it was the ordinary station of"
edgarallanpoe,the prefect of the eastern provinces; and many of the emperors of the
edgarallanpoe,"queen city (among whom may be mentioned, especially, Verus and Valens)"
edgarallanpoe,spent here the greater part of their time. But I perceive we have
edgarallanpoe,"arrived at the city itself. Let us ascend this battlement, and throw our"
edgarallanpoe,eyes upon the town and neighboring country.
edgarallanpoe,"“What broad and rapid river is that which forces its way, with"
edgarallanpoe,"innumerable falls, through the mountainous wilderness, and finally"
edgarallanpoe,through the wilderness of buildings?”
edgarallanpoe,"That is the Orontes, and it is the only water in sight, with the"
edgarallanpoe,"exception of the Mediterranean, which stretches, like a broad mirror,"
edgarallanpoe,about twelve miles off to the southward. Every one has seen the
edgarallanpoe,"Mediterranean; but let me tell you, there are few who have had a peep at"
edgarallanpoe,"Antioch. By few, I mean, few who, like you and me, have had, at the same"
edgarallanpoe,"time, the advantages of a modern education. Therefore cease to regard"
edgarallanpoe,"that sea, and give your whole attention to the mass of houses that lie"
edgarallanpoe,beneath us. You will remember that it is now the year of the world three
edgarallanpoe,"thousand eight hundred and thirty. Were it later--for example, were"
edgarallanpoe,"it the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and forty-five, we should be"
edgarallanpoe,deprived of this extraordinary spectacle. In the nineteenth century
edgarallanpoe,"Antioch is--that is to say, Antioch will be--in a lamentable state"
edgarallanpoe,"of decay. It will have been, by that time, totally destroyed, at three"
edgarallanpoe,"different periods, by three successive earthquakes. Indeed, to say the"
edgarallanpoe,"truth, what little of its former self may then remain, will be found in"
edgarallanpoe,so desolate and ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed
edgarallanpoe,"his residence to Damascus. This is well. I see you profit by my advice,"
edgarallanpoe,and are making the most of your time in inspecting the premises--in
edgarallanpoe,-satisfying your eyes
edgarallanpoe,With the memorials and the things of fame
edgarallanpoe,That most renown this city.--
edgarallanpoe,I beg pardon; I had forgotten that Shakespeare will not flourish for
edgarallanpoe,seventeen hundred and fifty years to come. But does not the appearance
edgarallanpoe,of Epidaphne justify me in calling it grotesque?
edgarallanpoe,“It is well fortified; and in this respect is as much indebted to nature
edgarallanpoe,as to art.”
edgarallanpoe,Very true.
edgarallanpoe,“There are a prodigious number of stately palaces.”
edgarallanpoe,There are.
edgarallanpoe,"“And the numerous temples, sumptuous and magnificent, may bear"
edgarallanpoe,comparison with the most lauded of antiquity.”
edgarallanpoe,"All this I must acknowledge. Still there is an infinity of mud huts, and"
edgarallanpoe,abominable hovels. We cannot help perceiving abundance of filth in
edgarallanpoe,"every kennel, and, were it not for the over-powering fumes of idolatrous"
edgarallanpoe,"incense, I have no doubt we should find a most intolerable stench."
edgarallanpoe,"Did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so"
edgarallanpoe,miraculously tall? What gloom their shadows cast upon the ground! It
edgarallanpoe,is well the swinging lamps in those endless colonnades are kept burning
edgarallanpoe,throughout the day; we should otherwise have the darkness of Egypt in
edgarallanpoe,the time of her desolation.
edgarallanpoe,“It is certainly a strange place! What is the meaning of yonder singular
edgarallanpoe,"building? See! it towers above all others, and lies to the eastward of"
edgarallanpoe,what I take to be the royal palace.”
edgarallanpoe,"That is the new Temple of the Sun, who is adored in Syria under the"
edgarallanpoe,title of Elah Gabalah. Hereafter a very notorious Roman Emperor
edgarallanpoe,"will institute this worship in Rome, and thence derive a cognomen,"
edgarallanpoe,Heliogabalus. I dare say you would like to take a peep at the divinity
edgarallanpoe,of the temple. You need not look up at the heavens; his Sunship is not
edgarallanpoe,there--at least not the Sunship adored by the Syrians. That deity will
edgarallanpoe,be found in the interior of yonder building. He is worshipped under the
edgarallanpoe,figure of a large stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or
edgarallanpoe,"pyramid, whereby is denoted Fire."
edgarallanpoe,"“Hark--behold!--who can those ridiculous beings be, half naked, with"
edgarallanpoe,"their faces painted, shouting and gesticulating to the rabble?”"
edgarallanpoe,Some few are mountebanks. Others more particularly belong to the race
edgarallanpoe,"of philosophers. The greatest portion, however--those especially who"
edgarallanpoe,belabor the populace with clubs--are the principal courtiers of the
edgarallanpoe,"palace, executing as in duty bound, some laudable comicality of the"
edgarallanpoe,king’s.
edgarallanpoe,“But what have we here? Heavens! the town is swarming with wild beasts!
edgarallanpoe,How terrible a spectacle!--how dangerous a peculiarity!”
edgarallanpoe,"Terrible, if you please; but not in the least degree dangerous. Each"
edgarallanpoe,"animal if you will take the pains to observe, is following, very"
edgarallanpoe,"quietly, in the wake of its master. Some few, to be sure, are led with a"
edgarallanpoe,"rope about the neck, but these are chiefly the lesser or timid species."
edgarallanpoe,"The lion, the tiger, and the leopard are entirely without restraint."
edgarallanpoe,They have been trained without difficulty to their present
edgarallanpoe,"profession, and attend upon their respective owners in the capacity of"
edgarallanpoe,"valets-de-chambre. It is true, there are occasions when Nature asserts"
edgarallanpoe,"her violated dominions;--but then the devouring of a man-at-arms, or the"
edgarallanpoe,"throttling of a consecrated bull, is a circumstance of too little moment"
edgarallanpoe,to be more than hinted at in Epidaphne.
edgarallanpoe,“But what extraordinary tumult do I hear? Surely this is a loud noise
edgarallanpoe,even for Antioch! It argues some commotion of unusual interest.”
edgarallanpoe,Yes--undoubtedly. The king has ordered some novel spectacle--some
edgarallanpoe,gladiatorial exhibition at the hippodrome--or perhaps the massacre of
edgarallanpoe,the Scythian prisoners--or the conflagration of his new palace--or the
edgarallanpoe,"tearing down of a handsome temple--or, indeed, a bonfire of a few Jews."
edgarallanpoe,The uproar increases. Shouts of laughter ascend the skies. The air
edgarallanpoe,"becomes dissonant with wind instruments, and horrible with clamor of a"
edgarallanpoe,"million throats. Let us descend, for the love of fun, and see what is"
edgarallanpoe,"going on! This way--be careful! Here we are in the principal street,"
edgarallanpoe,which is called the street of Timarchus. The sea of people is coming
edgarallanpoe,"this way, and we shall find a difficulty in stemming the tide. They are"
edgarallanpoe,"pouring through the alley of Heraclides, which leads directly from the"
edgarallanpoe,palace;--therefore the king is most probably among the rioters. Yes;--I
edgarallanpoe,hear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his approach in the pompous
edgarallanpoe,phraseology of the East. We shall have a glimpse of his person as
edgarallanpoe,he passes by the temple of Ashimah. Let us ensconce ourselves in the
edgarallanpoe,vestibule of the sanctuary; he will be here anon. In the meantime let
edgarallanpoe,us survey this image. What is it? Oh! it is the god Ashimah in proper
edgarallanpoe,"person. You perceive, however, that he is neither a lamb, nor a"
edgarallanpoe,"goat, nor a satyr, neither has he much resemblance to the Pan of the"
edgarallanpoe,Arcadians. Yet all these appearances have been given--I beg pardon--will
edgarallanpoe,"be given--by the learned of future ages, to the Ashimah of the Syrians."
edgarallanpoe,"Put on your spectacles, and tell me what it is. What is it?"
edgarallanpoe,“Bless me! it is an ape!”
edgarallanpoe,True--a baboon; but by no means the less a deity. His name is a
edgarallanpoe,derivation of the Greek Simia--what great fools are antiquarians! But
edgarallanpoe,see!--see!--yonder scampers a ragged little urchin. Where is he going?
edgarallanpoe,What is he bawling about? What does he say? Oh! he says the king
edgarallanpoe,is coming in triumph; that he is dressed in state; that he has just
edgarallanpoe,"finished putting to death, with his own hand, a thousand chained"
edgarallanpoe,Israelitish prisoners! For this exploit the ragamuffin is lauding him to
edgarallanpoe,the skies. Hark! here comes a troop of a similar description. They have
edgarallanpoe,"made a Latin hymn upon the valor of the king, and are singing it as they"
edgarallanpoe,go:
edgarallanpoe,"Mille, mille, mille,"
edgarallanpoe,"Mille, mille, mille,"
edgarallanpoe,"Decollavimus, unus homo!"
edgarallanpoe,"Mille, mille, mille, mille, decollavimus!"
edgarallanpoe,"Mille, mille, mille,"
edgarallanpoe,Vivat qui mille mille occidit!
edgarallanpoe,Tantum vini habet nemo
edgarallanpoe,Quantum sanguinis effudit!(*1)
edgarallanpoe,Which may be thus paraphrased:
edgarallanpoe,"A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,"
edgarallanpoe,"A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,"
edgarallanpoe,"We, with one warrior, have slain!"
edgarallanpoe,"A thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand."
edgarallanpoe,Sing a thousand over again!
edgarallanpoe,Soho!--let us sing
edgarallanpoe,"Long life to our king,"
edgarallanpoe,Who knocked over a thousand so fine!
edgarallanpoe,"Soho!--let us roar,"
edgarallanpoe,He has given us more
edgarallanpoe,Red gallons of gore
edgarallanpoe,Than all Syria can furnish of wine!
edgarallanpoe,“Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?”
edgarallanpoe,"Yes: the king is coming! See! the people are aghast with admiration,"
edgarallanpoe,and lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence. He comes;--he is
edgarallanpoe,coming;--there he is!
edgarallanpoe,“Who?--where?--the king?--do not behold him--cannot say that I perceive
edgarallanpoe,him.”
edgarallanpoe,Then you must be blind.
edgarallanpoe,“Very possible. Still I see nothing but a tumultuous mob of idiots
edgarallanpoe,"and madmen, who are busy in prostrating themselves before a gigantic"
edgarallanpoe,"cameleopard, and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the animal’s hoofs."
edgarallanpoe,See! the beast has very justly kicked one of the rabble over--and
edgarallanpoe,"another--and another--and another. Indeed, I cannot help admiring the"
edgarallanpoe,animal for the excellent use he is making of his feet.”
edgarallanpoe,"Rabble, indeed!--why these are the noble and free citizens of Epidaphne!"
edgarallanpoe,"Beasts, did you say?--take care that you are not overheard. Do you not"
edgarallanpoe,"perceive that the animal has the visage of a man? Why, my dear sir,"
edgarallanpoe,"that cameleopard is no other than Antiochus Epiphanes, Antiochus the"
edgarallanpoe,"Illustrious, King of Syria, and the most potent of all the autocrats"
edgarallanpoe,"of the East! It is true, that he is entitled, at times, Antiochus"
edgarallanpoe,Epimanes--Antiochus the madman--but that is because all people have not
edgarallanpoe,the capacity to appreciate his merits. It is also certain that he is at
edgarallanpoe,"present ensconced in the hide of a beast, and is doing his best to play"
edgarallanpoe,the part of a cameleopard; but this is done for the better sustaining
edgarallanpoe,"his dignity as king. Besides, the monarch is of gigantic stature,"
edgarallanpoe,"and the dress is therefore neither unbecoming nor over large. We may,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion"
edgarallanpoe,"of especial state. Such, you will allow, is the massacre of a thousand"
edgarallanpoe,Jews. With how superior a dignity the monarch perambulates on all fours!
edgarallanpoe,"His tail, you perceive, is held aloft by his two principal concubines,"
edgarallanpoe,Elline and Argelais; and his whole appearance would be infinitely
edgarallanpoe,"prepossessing, were it not for the protuberance of his eyes, which will"
edgarallanpoe,"certainly start out of his head, and the queer color of his face, which"
edgarallanpoe,has become nondescript from the quantity of wine he has swallowed. Let
edgarallanpoe,"us follow him to the hippodrome, whither he is proceeding, and listen to"
edgarallanpoe,the song of triumph which he is commencing:
edgarallanpoe,Who is king but Epiphanes?
edgarallanpoe,Say--do you know?
edgarallanpoe,Who is king but Epiphanes?
edgarallanpoe,Bravo!--bravo!
edgarallanpoe,"There is none but Epiphanes,"
edgarallanpoe,No--there is none:
edgarallanpoe,"So tear down the temples,"
edgarallanpoe,And put out the sun!
edgarallanpoe,Well and strenuously sung! The populace are hailing him ‘Prince of
edgarallanpoe,"Poets,’ as well as ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of the Universe,’ and"
edgarallanpoe,"‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards.’ They have encored his effusion,"
edgarallanpoe,and do you hear?--he is singing it over again. When he arrives at the
edgarallanpoe,"hippodrome, he will be crowned with the poetic wreath, in anticipation"
edgarallanpoe,of his victory at the approaching Olympics.
edgarallanpoe,"“But, good Jupiter! what is the matter in the crowd behind us?”"
edgarallanpoe,"Behind us, did you say?--oh! ah!--I perceive. My friend, it is well"
edgarallanpoe,that you spoke in time. Let us get into a place of safety as soon as
edgarallanpoe,"possible. Here!--let us conceal ourselves in the arch of this aqueduct,"
edgarallanpoe,and I will inform you presently of the origin of the commotion. It has
edgarallanpoe,turned out as I have been anticipating. The singular appearance of the
edgarallanpoe,"cameleopard and the head of a man, has, it seems, given offence to"
edgarallanpoe,"the notions of propriety entertained, in general, by the wild animals"
edgarallanpoe,"domesticated in the city. A mutiny has been the result; and, as is usual"
edgarallanpoe,"upon such occasions, all human efforts will be of no avail in quelling"
edgarallanpoe,the mob. Several of the Syrians have already been devoured; but the
edgarallanpoe,general voice of the four-footed patriots seems to be for eating up the
edgarallanpoe,"cameleopard. ‘The Prince of Poets,’ therefore, is upon his hinder legs,"
edgarallanpoe,"running for his life. His courtiers have left him in the lurch, and"
edgarallanpoe,his concubines have followed so excellent an example. ‘Delight of the
edgarallanpoe,"Universe,’ thou art in a sad predicament! ‘Glory of the East,’ thou art"
edgarallanpoe,in danger of mastication! Therefore never regard so piteously thy tail;
edgarallanpoe,"it will undoubtedly be draggled in the mud, and for this there is no"
edgarallanpoe,"help. Look not behind thee, then, at its unavoidable degradation; but"
edgarallanpoe,"take courage, ply thy legs with vigor, and scud for the hippodrome!"
edgarallanpoe,Remember that thou art Antiochus Epiphanes. Antiochus the
edgarallanpoe,"Illustrious!--also ‘Prince of Poets,’ ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of"
edgarallanpoe,"the Universe,’ and ‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards!’ Heavens! what a"
edgarallanpoe,power of speed thou art displaying! What a capacity for leg-bail
edgarallanpoe,"thou art developing! Run, Prince!--Bravo, Epiphanes! Well done,"
edgarallanpoe,Cameleopard!--Glorious Antiochus!--He runs!--he leaps!--he flies! Like
edgarallanpoe,an arrow from a catapult he approaches the hippodrome! He leaps!--he
edgarallanpoe,"shrieks!--he is there! This is well; for hadst thou, ‘Glory of"
edgarallanpoe,"the East,’ been half a second longer in reaching the gates of the"
edgarallanpoe,"Amphitheatre, there is not a bear’s cub in Epidaphne that would not"
edgarallanpoe,have had a nibble at thy carcase. Let us be off--let us take our
edgarallanpoe,departure!--for we shall find our delicate modern ears unable to endure
edgarallanpoe,the vast uproar which is about to commence in celebration of the king’s
edgarallanpoe,escape! Listen! it has already commenced. See!--the whole town is
edgarallanpoe,topsy-turvy.
edgarallanpoe,“Surely this is the most populous city of the East! What a wilderness
edgarallanpoe,of people! what a jumble of all ranks and ages! what a multiplicity
edgarallanpoe,of sects and nations! what a variety of costumes! what a Babel of
edgarallanpoe,languages! what a screaming of beasts! what a tinkling of instruments!
edgarallanpoe,what a parcel of philosophers!”
edgarallanpoe,Come let us be off.
edgarallanpoe,“Stay a moment! I see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome; what is the
edgarallanpoe,"meaning of it, I beseech you?”"
edgarallanpoe,"That?--oh, nothing! The noble and free citizens of Epidaphne being, as"
edgarallanpoe,"they declare, well satisfied of the faith, valor, wisdom, and divinity"
edgarallanpoe,"of their king, and having, moreover, been eye-witnesses of his late"
edgarallanpoe,"superhuman agility, do think it no more than their duty to invest his"
edgarallanpoe,brows (in addition to the poetic crown) with the wreath of victory
edgarallanpoe,in the footrace--a wreath which it is evident he must obtain at the
edgarallanpoe,"celebration of the next Olympiad, and which, therefore, they now give"
edgarallanpoe,him in advance.
edgarallanpoe,Footnotes--Four Beasts
edgarallanpoe,"(*1) Flavius Vospicus says, that the hymn here introduced was sung by"
edgarallanpoe,"the rabble upon the occasion of Aurelian, in the Sarmatic war, having"
edgarallanpoe,"slain, with his own hand, nine hundred and fifty of the enemy."
edgarallanpoe,THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE
edgarallanpoe,"What song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid"
edgarallanpoe,"himself among women, although puzzling questions, are not beyond"
edgarallanpoe,_all_ conjecture.
edgarallanpoe,--_Sir Thomas Browne._
edgarallanpoe,"The mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves,"
edgarallanpoe,but little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their
edgarallanpoe,"effects. We know of them, among other things, that they are always to"
edgarallanpoe,"their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest"
edgarallanpoe,"enjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting"
edgarallanpoe,"in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the"
edgarallanpoe,analyst in that moral activity which _disentangles._ He derives pleasure
edgarallanpoe,from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play. He
edgarallanpoe,"is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his"
edgarallanpoe,solutions of each a degree of _acumen_ which appears to the ordinary
edgarallanpoe,"apprehension præternatural. His results, brought about by the very soul"
edgarallanpoe,"and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition."
edgarallanpoe,The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical
edgarallanpoe,"study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and"
edgarallanpoe,"merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as"
edgarallanpoe,"if _par excellence_, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to"
edgarallanpoe,"analyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at"
edgarallanpoe,"the other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental"
edgarallanpoe,"character, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise,"
edgarallanpoe,but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very
edgarallanpoe,"much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the"
edgarallanpoe,higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more
edgarallanpoe,usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the
edgarallanpoe,"elaborate frivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have"
edgarallanpoe,"different and _bizarre_ motions, with various and variable values, what"
edgarallanpoe,is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound.
edgarallanpoe,The _attention_ is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an
edgarallanpoe,"instant, an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat. The"
edgarallanpoe,"possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such"
edgarallanpoe,oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the
edgarallanpoe,more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In
edgarallanpoe,"draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are _unique_ and have but"
edgarallanpoe,"little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and"
edgarallanpoe,"the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages"
edgarallanpoe,are obtained by either party are obtained by superior _acumen_. To be
edgarallanpoe,less abstract--Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are
edgarallanpoe,"reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be"
edgarallanpoe,expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the
edgarallanpoe,"players being at all equal) only by some _recherché_ movement, the"
edgarallanpoe,result of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary
edgarallanpoe,"resources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent,"
edgarallanpoe,"identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a"
edgarallanpoe,"glance, the sole methods (sometime indeed absurdly simple ones) by which"
edgarallanpoe,he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.
edgarallanpoe,Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the
edgarallanpoe,calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been
edgarallanpoe,"known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing"
edgarallanpoe,chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature
edgarallanpoe,so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best chess-player in
edgarallanpoe,Christendom _may_ be little more than the best player of chess; but
edgarallanpoe,proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more
edgarallanpoe,important undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say
edgarallanpoe,"proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a"
edgarallanpoe,comprehension of _all_ the sources whence legitimate advantage may be
edgarallanpoe,"derived. These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently"
edgarallanpoe,among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary
edgarallanpoe,"understanding. To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and,"
edgarallanpoe,"so far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while"
edgarallanpoe,the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the
edgarallanpoe,game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible. Thus to have a
edgarallanpoe,"retentive memory, and to proceed by “the book,” are points commonly"
edgarallanpoe,regarded as the sum total of good playing. But it is in matters beyond
edgarallanpoe,the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced. He
edgarallanpoe,"makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps,"
edgarallanpoe,do his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information
edgarallanpoe,"obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the"
edgarallanpoe,quality of the observation. The necessary knowledge is that of _what_ to
edgarallanpoe,"observe. Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game"
edgarallanpoe,"is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the"
edgarallanpoe,"game. He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully"
edgarallanpoe,with that of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting
edgarallanpoe,"the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by"
edgarallanpoe,"honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes"
edgarallanpoe,"every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund"
edgarallanpoe,"of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of"
edgarallanpoe,"surprise, of triumph, or of chagrin. From the manner of gathering up"
edgarallanpoe,a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the
edgarallanpoe,"suit. He recognises what is played through feint, by the air with"
edgarallanpoe,which it is thrown upon the table. A casual or inadvertent word; the
edgarallanpoe,"accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety"
edgarallanpoe,or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the
edgarallanpoe,"tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation,"
edgarallanpoe,"eagerness or trepidation--all afford, to his apparently intuitive"
edgarallanpoe,"perception, indications of the true state of affairs. The first two"
edgarallanpoe,"or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the"
edgarallanpoe,"contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as"
edgarallanpoe,absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned
edgarallanpoe,outward the faces of their own.
edgarallanpoe,The analytical power should not be confounded with ample ingenuity; for
edgarallanpoe,"while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often"
edgarallanpoe,"remarkably incapable of analysis. The constructive or combining power,"
edgarallanpoe,"by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists"
edgarallanpoe,"(I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a"
edgarallanpoe,"primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect"
edgarallanpoe,"bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation"
edgarallanpoe,among writers on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability
edgarallanpoe,"there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the"
edgarallanpoe,"fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous."
edgarallanpoe,"It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and"
edgarallanpoe,the _truly_ imaginative never otherwise than analytic.
edgarallanpoe,The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the
edgarallanpoe,light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.
edgarallanpoe,"Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18--, I"
edgarallanpoe,there became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin. This young
edgarallanpoe,"gentleman was of an excellent--indeed of an illustrious family, but, by"
edgarallanpoe,"a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the"
edgarallanpoe,"energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir"
edgarallanpoe,"himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes."
edgarallanpoe,"By courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a"
edgarallanpoe,"small remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this,"
edgarallanpoe,"he managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries"
edgarallanpoe,"of life, without troubling himself about its superfluities. Books,"
edgarallanpoe,"indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained."
edgarallanpoe,"Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where"
edgarallanpoe,the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very
edgarallanpoe,"remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion. We saw each other"
edgarallanpoe,again and again. I was deeply interested in the little family history
edgarallanpoe,which he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges
edgarallanpoe,"whenever mere self is his theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast"
edgarallanpoe,"extent of his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within"
edgarallanpoe,"me by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination."
edgarallanpoe,"Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of"
edgarallanpoe,such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I
edgarallanpoe,frankly confided to him. It was at length arranged that we should live
edgarallanpoe,together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances
edgarallanpoe,"were somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be"
edgarallanpoe,"at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the"
edgarallanpoe,"rather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque"
edgarallanpoe,"mansion, long deserted through superstitions into which we did not"
edgarallanpoe,"inquire, and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of"
edgarallanpoe,the Faubourg St. Germain.
edgarallanpoe,"Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we"
edgarallanpoe,"should have been regarded as madmen--although, perhaps, as madmen of"
edgarallanpoe,a harmless nature. Our seclusion was perfect. We admitted no visitors.
edgarallanpoe,Indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret
edgarallanpoe,from my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin
edgarallanpoe,had ceased to know or be known in Paris. We existed within ourselves
edgarallanpoe,alone.
edgarallanpoe,It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to
edgarallanpoe,"be enamored of the Night for her own sake; and into this _bizarrerie_,"
edgarallanpoe,"as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild"
edgarallanpoe,whims with a perfect _abandon_. The sable divinity would not herself
edgarallanpoe,dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the
edgarallanpoe,first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old
edgarallanpoe,"building; lighting a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw"
edgarallanpoe,out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we
edgarallanpoe,"then busied our souls in dreams--reading, writing, or conversing, until"
edgarallanpoe,warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness. Then we sallied
edgarallanpoe,"forth into the streets arm in arm, continuing the topics of the day, or"
edgarallanpoe,"roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights"
edgarallanpoe,"and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement"
edgarallanpoe,which quiet observation can afford.
edgarallanpoe,At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from
edgarallanpoe,his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic
edgarallanpoe,"ability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its"
edgarallanpoe,exercise--if not exactly in its display--and did not hesitate to confess
edgarallanpoe,"the pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh,"
edgarallanpoe,"that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms,"
edgarallanpoe,and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling
edgarallanpoe,proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments
edgarallanpoe,was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his
edgarallanpoe,"voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded"
edgarallanpoe,petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the
edgarallanpoe,"enunciation. Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively"
edgarallanpoe,"upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the"
edgarallanpoe,fancy of a double Dupin--the creative and the resolvent.
edgarallanpoe,"Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing"
edgarallanpoe,"any mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the"
edgarallanpoe,"Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased"
edgarallanpoe,intelligence. But of the character of his remarks at the periods in
edgarallanpoe,question an example will best convey the idea.
edgarallanpoe,We were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of
edgarallanpoe,"the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither"
edgarallanpoe,of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once
edgarallanpoe,Dupin broke forth with these words:
edgarallanpoe,"“He is a very little fellow, that’s true, and would do better for the"
edgarallanpoe,_Théâtre des Variétés_.”
edgarallanpoe,"“There can be no doubt of that,” I replied unwittingly, and not at first"
edgarallanpoe,observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary
edgarallanpoe,manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In
edgarallanpoe,"an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was"
edgarallanpoe,profound.
edgarallanpoe,"“Dupin,” said I, gravely, “this is beyond my comprehension. I do not"
edgarallanpoe,"hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How"
edgarallanpoe,"was it possible you should know I was thinking of -----?” Here I paused,"
edgarallanpoe,to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.
edgarallanpoe,"--“of Chantilly,” said he, “why do you pause? You were remarking to"
edgarallanpoe,yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.”
edgarallanpoe,This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections.
edgarallanpoe,"Chantilly was a _quondam_ cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming"
edgarallanpoe,"stage-mad, had attempted the _rôle_ of Xerxes, in Crébillon’s tragedy so"
edgarallanpoe,"called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains."
edgarallanpoe,"“Tell me, for Heaven’s sake,” I exclaimed, “the method--if method there"
edgarallanpoe,is--by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.” In
edgarallanpoe,fact I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.
edgarallanpoe,"“It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who brought you to the"
edgarallanpoe,conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for
edgarallanpoe,Xerxes _et id genus omne_.”
edgarallanpoe,“The fruiterer!--you astonish me--I know no fruiterer whomsoever.”
edgarallanpoe,“The man who ran up against you as we entered the street--it may have
edgarallanpoe,been fifteen minutes ago.”
edgarallanpoe,"I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a"
edgarallanpoe,"large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we"
edgarallanpoe,passed from the Rue C ---- into the thoroughfare where we stood; but
edgarallanpoe,what this had to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand.
edgarallanpoe,There was not a particle of _charlatanerie_ about Dupin. “I will
edgarallanpoe,"explain,” he said, “and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will"
edgarallanpoe,"first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which"
edgarallanpoe,I spoke to you until that of the _rencontre_ with the fruiterer in
edgarallanpoe,"question. The larger links of the chain run thus--Chantilly, Orion, Dr."
edgarallanpoe,"Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.”"
edgarallanpoe,"There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives,"
edgarallanpoe,amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions
edgarallanpoe,of their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of
edgarallanpoe,interest and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by
edgarallanpoe,the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the
edgarallanpoe,"starting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement"
edgarallanpoe,"when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I"
edgarallanpoe,could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:
edgarallanpoe,"“We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before"
edgarallanpoe,leaving the Rue C ----. This was the last subject we discussed. As we
edgarallanpoe,"crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his"
edgarallanpoe,"head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving stones"
edgarallanpoe,collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped
edgarallanpoe,"upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle,"
edgarallanpoe,"appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the"
edgarallanpoe,"pile, and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to"
edgarallanpoe,"what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of"
edgarallanpoe,necessity.
edgarallanpoe,"“You kept your eyes upon the ground--glancing, with a petulant"
edgarallanpoe,"expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you"
edgarallanpoe,"were still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the little alley"
edgarallanpoe,"called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the"
edgarallanpoe,"overlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened up,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the"
edgarallanpoe,"word ‘stereotomy,’ a term very affectedly applied to this species of"
edgarallanpoe,pavement. I knew that you could not say to yourself ‘stereotomy’ without
edgarallanpoe,"being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus;"
edgarallanpoe,"and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned"
edgarallanpoe,"to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses"
edgarallanpoe,of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular
edgarallanpoe,"cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to"
edgarallanpoe,"the great _nebula_ in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do"
edgarallanpoe,so. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed
edgarallanpoe,"your steps. But in that bitter _tirade_ upon Chantilly, which appeared"
edgarallanpoe,"in yesterday’s ‘_Musée_,’ the satirist, making some disgraceful"
edgarallanpoe,"allusions to the cobbler’s change of name upon assuming the buskin,"
edgarallanpoe,quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed. I mean the line
edgarallanpoe,Perdidit antiquum litera sonum.
edgarallanpoe,"“I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written"
edgarallanpoe,"Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I"
edgarallanpoe,"was aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore,"
edgarallanpoe,that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly.
edgarallanpoe,That you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which
edgarallanpoe,passed over your lips. You thought of the poor cobbler’s immolation. So
edgarallanpoe,"far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself"
edgarallanpoe,up to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the
edgarallanpoe,diminutive figure of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your
edgarallanpoe,"meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little"
edgarallanpoe,fellow--that Chantilly--he would do better at the _Théâtre des
edgarallanpoe,Variétés_.”
edgarallanpoe,"Not long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of the"
edgarallanpoe,"“Gazette des Tribunaux,” when the following paragraphs arrested our"
edgarallanpoe,attention.
edgarallanpoe,"“EXTRAORDINARY MURDERS.--This morning, about three o’clock, the"
edgarallanpoe,inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a
edgarallanpoe,"succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth"
edgarallanpoe,"story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of"
edgarallanpoe,"one Madame L’Espanaye, and her daughter Mademoiselle Camille L’Espanaye."
edgarallanpoe,"After some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission"
edgarallanpoe,"in the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight"
edgarallanpoe,or ten of the neighbors entered accompanied by two _gendarmes_. By this
edgarallanpoe,"time the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first"
edgarallanpoe,"flight of stairs, two or more rough voices in angry contention were"
edgarallanpoe,distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house.
edgarallanpoe,"As the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased and"
edgarallanpoe,everything remained perfectly quiet. The party spread themselves and
edgarallanpoe,hurried from room to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber in
edgarallanpoe,"the fourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key"
edgarallanpoe,"inside, was forced open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck"
edgarallanpoe,every one present not less with horror than with astonishment.
edgarallanpoe,“The apartment was in the wildest disorder--the furniture broken and
edgarallanpoe,thrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from
edgarallanpoe,"this the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor."
edgarallanpoe,"On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or"
edgarallanpoe,"three long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood,"
edgarallanpoe,and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were
edgarallanpoe,"found four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons,"
edgarallanpoe,"three smaller of_ métal d’Alger_, and two bags, containing nearly four"
edgarallanpoe,"thousand francs in gold. The drawers of a _bureau_, which stood in"
edgarallanpoe,"one corner were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many"
edgarallanpoe,articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under
edgarallanpoe,"the _bed_ (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still in"
edgarallanpoe,"the door. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers"
edgarallanpoe,of little consequence.
edgarallanpoe,“Of Madame L’Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity
edgarallanpoe,"of soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the"
edgarallanpoe,"chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, head"
edgarallanpoe,"downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the"
edgarallanpoe,narrow aperture for a considerable distance. The body was quite warm.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned"
edgarallanpoe,by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon
edgarallanpoe,"the face were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises,"
edgarallanpoe,"and deep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been"
edgarallanpoe,throttled to death.
edgarallanpoe,"“After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without"
edgarallanpoe,"farther discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in"
edgarallanpoe,"the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her"
edgarallanpoe,"throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell"
edgarallanpoe,"off. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated--the former"
edgarallanpoe,so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity.
edgarallanpoe,"“To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest"
edgarallanpoe,clew.”
edgarallanpoe,The next day’s paper had these additional particulars.
edgarallanpoe,“_The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue._ Many individuals have been examined
edgarallanpoe,in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair. [The word
edgarallanpoe,"‘affaire’ has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it conveys"
edgarallanpoe,"with us,] “but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it."
edgarallanpoe,We give below all the material testimony elicited.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Pauline Dubourg_, laundress, deposes that she has known both the"
edgarallanpoe,"deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period."
edgarallanpoe,The old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms--very affectionate
edgarallanpoe,towards each other. They were excellent pay. Could not speak in regard
edgarallanpoe,to their mode or means of living. Believed that Madame L. told fortunes
edgarallanpoe,for a living. Was reputed to have money put by. Never met any persons
edgarallanpoe,in the house when she called for the clothes or took them home. Was sure
edgarallanpoe,that they had no servant in employ. There appeared to be no furniture in
edgarallanpoe,any part of the building except in the fourth story.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Pierre Moreau_, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of"
edgarallanpoe,selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame L’Espanaye for
edgarallanpoe,"nearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided"
edgarallanpoe,there. The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the
edgarallanpoe,"corpses were found, for more than six years. It was formerly occupied by"
edgarallanpoe,"a jeweller, who under-let the upper rooms to various persons. The house"
edgarallanpoe,was the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse of
edgarallanpoe,"the premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let"
edgarallanpoe,any portion. The old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter
edgarallanpoe,some five or six times during the six years. The two lived an
edgarallanpoe,exceedingly retired life--were reputed to have money. Had heard it said
edgarallanpoe,among the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes--did not believe it.
edgarallanpoe,Had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her
edgarallanpoe,"daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or ten"
edgarallanpoe,times.
edgarallanpoe,"“Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect. No one"
edgarallanpoe,was spoken of as frequenting the house. It was not known whether there
edgarallanpoe,were any living connexions of Madame L. and her daughter. The shutters
edgarallanpoe,of the front windows were seldom opened. Those in the rear were always
edgarallanpoe,"closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story. The"
edgarallanpoe,house was a good house--not very old.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Isidore Muset_, _gendarme_, deposes that he was called to the house"
edgarallanpoe,"about three o’clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty"
edgarallanpoe,"persons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced it open,"
edgarallanpoe,"at length, with a bayonet--not with a crowbar. Had but little difficulty"
edgarallanpoe,"in getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate,"
edgarallanpoe,and bolted neither at bottom not top. The shrieks were continued until
edgarallanpoe,the gate was forced--and then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams
edgarallanpoe,"of some person (or persons) in great agony--were loud and drawn out,"
edgarallanpoe,not short and quick. Witness led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the
edgarallanpoe,"first landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention--the one"
edgarallanpoe,"a gruff voice, the other much shriller--a very strange voice. Could"
edgarallanpoe,"distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman. Was"
edgarallanpoe,positive that it was not a woman’s voice. Could distinguish the words
edgarallanpoe,‘_sacré_’ and ‘_diable._’ The shrill voice was that of a foreigner.
edgarallanpoe,Could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman. Could
edgarallanpoe,"not make out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish. The"
edgarallanpoe,state of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we
edgarallanpoe,described them yesterday.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Henri Duval_, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes that"
edgarallanpoe,he was one of the party who first entered the house. Corroborates the
edgarallanpoe,"testimony of Muset in general. As soon as they forced an entrance, they"
edgarallanpoe,"reclosed the door, to keep out the crowd, which collected very fast,"
edgarallanpoe,"notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The shrill voice, this witness"
edgarallanpoe,"thinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain it was not French. Could not"
edgarallanpoe,be sure that it was a man’s voice. It might have been a woman’s. Was not
edgarallanpoe,"acquainted with the Italian language. Could not distinguish the words,"
edgarallanpoe,but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian.
edgarallanpoe,Knew Madame L. and her daughter. Had conversed with both frequently. Was
edgarallanpoe,sure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.
edgarallanpoe,"“--_Odenheimer, restaurateur._ This witness volunteered his testimony."
edgarallanpoe,"Not speaking French, was examined through an interpreter. Is a native of"
edgarallanpoe,Amsterdam. Was passing the house at the time of the shrieks. They lasted
edgarallanpoe,for several minutes--probably ten. They were long and loud--very awful
edgarallanpoe,and distressing. Was one of those who entered the building. Corroborated
edgarallanpoe,the previous evidence in every respect but one. Was sure that the shrill
edgarallanpoe,voice was that of a man--of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish the
edgarallanpoe,words uttered. They were loud and quick--unequal--spoken apparently in
edgarallanpoe,fear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh--not so much shrill as
edgarallanpoe,harsh. Could not call it a shrill voice. The gruff voice said repeatedly
edgarallanpoe,"‘_sacré_,’ ‘_diable_,’ and once ‘_mon Dieu._’"
edgarallanpoe,"“_Jules Mignaud_, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue Deloraine."
edgarallanpoe,Is the elder Mignaud. Madame L’Espanaye had some property. Had opened an
edgarallanpoe,account with his banking house in the spring of the year--(eight years
edgarallanpoe,previously). Made frequent deposits in small sums. Had checked for
edgarallanpoe,"nothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in"
edgarallanpoe,"person the sum of 4000 francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk"
edgarallanpoe,went home with the money.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Adolphe Le Bon_, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in"
edgarallanpoe,"question, about noon, he accompanied Madame L’Espanaye to her residence"
edgarallanpoe,"with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags. Upon the door being opened,"
edgarallanpoe,"Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while"
edgarallanpoe,the old lady relieved him of the other. He then bowed and departed. Did
edgarallanpoe,not see any person in the street at the time. It is a bye-street--very
edgarallanpoe,lonely.
edgarallanpoe,"“_William Bird_, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered"
edgarallanpoe,the house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two years. Was one of
edgarallanpoe,the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in contention. The
edgarallanpoe,"gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could make out several words, but"
edgarallanpoe,cannot now remember all. Heard distinctly ‘_sacré_’ and ‘_mon Dieu._’
edgarallanpoe,There was a sound at the moment as if of several persons struggling--a
edgarallanpoe,scraping and scuffling sound. The shrill voice was very loud--louder
edgarallanpoe,than the gruff one. Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman.
edgarallanpoe,Appeared to be that of a German. Might have been a woman’s voice. Does
edgarallanpoe,not understand German.
edgarallanpoe,"“Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the"
edgarallanpoe,door of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L.
edgarallanpoe,was locked on the inside when the party reached it. Every thing was
edgarallanpoe,perfectly silent--no groans or noises of any kind. Upon forcing the door
edgarallanpoe,"no person was seen. The windows, both of the back and front room, were"
edgarallanpoe,down and firmly fastened from within. A door between the two rooms was
edgarallanpoe,"closed, but not locked. The door leading from the front room into the"
edgarallanpoe,"passage was locked, with the key on the inside. A small room in the"
edgarallanpoe,"front of the house, on the fourth story, at the head of the passage was"
edgarallanpoe,"open, the door being ajar. This room was crowded with old beds, boxes,"
edgarallanpoe,and so forth. These were carefully removed and searched. There was not
edgarallanpoe,an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched.
edgarallanpoe,Sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys. The house was a four story
edgarallanpoe,"one, with garrets (_mansardes._) A trap-door on the roof was nailed down"
edgarallanpoe,very securely--did not appear to have been opened for years. The
edgarallanpoe,time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the
edgarallanpoe,"breaking open of the room door, was variously stated by the witnesses."
edgarallanpoe,Some made it as short as three minutes--some as long as five. The door
edgarallanpoe,was opened with difficulty.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Alfonzo Garcio_, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue"
edgarallanpoe,Morgue. Is a native of Spain. Was one of the party who entered the
edgarallanpoe,"house. Did not proceed up stairs. Is nervous, and was apprehensive of"
edgarallanpoe,the consequences of agitation. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff
edgarallanpoe,voice was that of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish what was said.
edgarallanpoe,The shrill voice was that of an Englishman--is sure of this. Does not
edgarallanpoe,"understand the English language, but judges by the intonation."
edgarallanpoe,"“_Alberto Montani_, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first"
edgarallanpoe,to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was
edgarallanpoe,that of a Frenchman. Distinguished several words. The speaker appeared
edgarallanpoe,to be expostulating. Could not make out the words of the shrill voice.
edgarallanpoe,Spoke quick and unevenly. Thinks it the voice of a Russian. Corroborates
edgarallanpoe,the general testimony. Is an Italian. Never conversed with a native of
edgarallanpoe,Russia.
edgarallanpoe,"“Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all"
edgarallanpoe,the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a
edgarallanpoe,"human being. By ‘sweeps’ were meant cylindrical sweeping brushes, such"
edgarallanpoe,as are employed by those who clean chimneys. These brushes were passed
edgarallanpoe,up and down every flue in the house. There is no back passage by which
edgarallanpoe,any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs. The
edgarallanpoe,body of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that
edgarallanpoe,it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their
edgarallanpoe,strength.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Paul Dumas_, physician, deposes that he was called to view the"
edgarallanpoe,bodies about day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking of the
edgarallanpoe,bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of
edgarallanpoe,the young lady was much bruised and excoriated. The fact that it
edgarallanpoe,had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these
edgarallanpoe,appearances. The throat was greatly chafed. There were several deep
edgarallanpoe,"scratches just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots"
edgarallanpoe,which were evidently the impression of fingers. The face was fearfully
edgarallanpoe,"discolored, and the eye-balls protruded. The tongue had been partially"
edgarallanpoe,bitten through. A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the
edgarallanpoe,"stomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion"
edgarallanpoe,"of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle L’Espanaye had been throttled to death by"
edgarallanpoe,some person or persons unknown. The corpse of the mother was horribly
edgarallanpoe,mutilated. All the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less
edgarallanpoe,"shattered. The left _tibia_ much splintered, as well as all the ribs of"
edgarallanpoe,the left side. Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was not
edgarallanpoe,possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of
edgarallanpoe,"wood, or a broad bar of iron--a chair--any large, heavy, and obtuse"
edgarallanpoe,"weapon would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of"
edgarallanpoe,a very powerful man. No woman could have inflicted the blows with any
edgarallanpoe,"weapon. The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely"
edgarallanpoe,"separated from the body, and was also greatly shattered. The throat"
edgarallanpoe,had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument--probably with a
edgarallanpoe,razor.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Alexandre Etienne_, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the"
edgarallanpoe,"bodies. Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas."
edgarallanpoe,"“Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other"
edgarallanpoe,"persons were examined. A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all"
edgarallanpoe,"its particulars, was never before committed in Paris--if indeed a murder"
edgarallanpoe,has been committed at all. The police are entirely at fault--an unusual
edgarallanpoe,"occurrence in affairs of this nature. There is not, however, the shadow"
edgarallanpoe,of a clew apparent.”
edgarallanpoe,The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement
edgarallanpoe,still continued in the Quartier St. Roch--that the premises in question
edgarallanpoe,"had been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses"
edgarallanpoe,"instituted, but all to no purpose. A postscript, however, mentioned"
edgarallanpoe,that Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned--although nothing
edgarallanpoe,"appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed."
edgarallanpoe,Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair--at
edgarallanpoe,"least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments. It was only"
edgarallanpoe,"after the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me"
edgarallanpoe,my opinion respecting the murders.
edgarallanpoe,I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble
edgarallanpoe,mystery. I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the
edgarallanpoe,murderer.
edgarallanpoe,"“We must not judge of the means,” said Dupin, “by this shell of an"
edgarallanpoe,"examination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for _acumen_, are"
edgarallanpoe,"cunning, but no more. There is no method in their proceedings, beyond"
edgarallanpoe,"the method of the moment. They make a vast parade of measures; but, not"
edgarallanpoe,"unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as"
edgarallanpoe,to put us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain’s calling for his
edgarallanpoe,_robe-de-chambre--pour mieux entendre la musique._ The results attained
edgarallanpoe,"by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are"
edgarallanpoe,brought about by simple diligence and activity. When these qualities are
edgarallanpoe,"unavailing, their schemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good"
edgarallanpoe,"guesser and a persevering man. But, without educated thought, he erred"
edgarallanpoe,continually by the very intensity of his investigations. He impaired his
edgarallanpoe,"vision by holding the object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or"
edgarallanpoe,"two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost"
edgarallanpoe,sight of the matter as a whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too
edgarallanpoe,"profound. Truth is not always in a well. In fact, as regards the more"
edgarallanpoe,"important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial."
edgarallanpoe,"The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the"
edgarallanpoe,mountain-tops where she is found. The modes and sources of this kind of
edgarallanpoe,error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies.
edgarallanpoe,"To look at a star by glances--to view it in a side-long way, by turning"
edgarallanpoe,toward it the exterior portions of the _retina_ (more susceptible of
edgarallanpoe,"feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star"
edgarallanpoe,distinctly--is to have the best appreciation of its lustre--a lustre
edgarallanpoe,which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision _fully_ upon
edgarallanpoe,it. A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter
edgarallanpoe,"case, but, in the former, there is the more refined capacity for"
edgarallanpoe,comprehension. By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and
edgarallanpoe,it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmanent by a
edgarallanpoe,"scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct."
edgarallanpoe,"“As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for"
edgarallanpoe,"ourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them. An inquiry will"
edgarallanpoe,"afford us amusement,” [I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said"
edgarallanpoe,"nothing] “and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I"
edgarallanpoe,am not ungrateful. We will go and see the premises with our own eyes.
edgarallanpoe,"I know G----, the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in"
edgarallanpoe,obtaining the necessary permission.”
edgarallanpoe,"The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue."
edgarallanpoe,This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the
edgarallanpoe,Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was late in the afternoon when we
edgarallanpoe,reached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we
edgarallanpoe,resided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons
edgarallanpoe,"gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from"
edgarallanpoe,"the opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with"
edgarallanpoe,"a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding"
edgarallanpoe,"panel in the window, indicating a _loge de concierge._ Before going in"
edgarallanpoe,"we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning,"
edgarallanpoe,"passed in the rear of the building--Dupin, meanwhile examining the whole"
edgarallanpoe,"neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for"
edgarallanpoe,which I could see no possible object.
edgarallanpoe,"Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang,"
edgarallanpoe,"and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents"
edgarallanpoe,in charge. We went up stairs--into the chamber where the body of
edgarallanpoe,"Mademoiselle L’Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased"
edgarallanpoe,"still lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to"
edgarallanpoe,exist. I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the “Gazette des
edgarallanpoe,Tribunaux.” Dupin scrutinized every thing--not excepting the bodies of
edgarallanpoe,"the victims. We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a"
edgarallanpoe,_gendarme_ accompanying us throughout. The examination occupied us until
edgarallanpoe,"dark, when we took our departure. On our way home my companion stepped"
edgarallanpoe,in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers.
edgarallanpoe,"I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that _Je les"
edgarallanpoe,ménageais_:--for this phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his
edgarallanpoe,"humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder,"
edgarallanpoe,"until about noon the next day. He then asked me, suddenly, if I had"
edgarallanpoe,observed any thing _peculiar_ at the scene of the atrocity.
edgarallanpoe,"There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word “peculiar,”"
edgarallanpoe,"which caused me to shudder, without knowing why."
edgarallanpoe,"“No, nothing _peculiar_,” I said; “nothing more, at least, than we both"
edgarallanpoe,saw stated in the paper.”
edgarallanpoe,"“The ‘Gazette,’” he replied, “has not entered, I fear, into the unusual"
edgarallanpoe,horror of the thing. But dismiss the idle opinions of this print. It
edgarallanpoe,"appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very"
edgarallanpoe,reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution--I mean
edgarallanpoe,for the _outré_ character of its features. The police are confounded by
edgarallanpoe,the seeming absence of motive--not for the murder itself--but for
edgarallanpoe,"the atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming"
edgarallanpoe,"impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with"
edgarallanpoe,the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated
edgarallanpoe,"Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without"
edgarallanpoe,the notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the
edgarallanpoe,"corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful"
edgarallanpoe,"mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those"
edgarallanpoe,"just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed"
edgarallanpoe,"to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted"
edgarallanpoe,"_acumen_, of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but"
edgarallanpoe,common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by
edgarallanpoe,"these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its"
edgarallanpoe,"way, if at all, in its search for the true. In investigations such as we"
edgarallanpoe,"are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked ‘what has occurred,’"
edgarallanpoe,"as ‘what has occurred that has never occurred before.’ In fact, the"
edgarallanpoe,"facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of"
edgarallanpoe,"this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the"
edgarallanpoe,eyes of the police.”
edgarallanpoe,I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.
edgarallanpoe,"“I am now awaiting,” continued he, looking toward the door of our"
edgarallanpoe,"apartment--“I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not"
edgarallanpoe,"the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure"
edgarallanpoe,implicated in their perpetration. Of the worst portion of the crimes
edgarallanpoe,"committed, it is probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am right"
edgarallanpoe,in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the
edgarallanpoe,entire riddle. I look for the man here--in this room--every moment. It
edgarallanpoe,is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will.
edgarallanpoe,"Should he come, it will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols;"
edgarallanpoe,and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use.”
edgarallanpoe,"I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what"
edgarallanpoe,"I heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy. I have"
edgarallanpoe,already spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His discourse was
edgarallanpoe,"addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that"
edgarallanpoe,intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great
edgarallanpoe,"distance. His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall."
edgarallanpoe,"“That the voices heard in contention,” he said, “by the party upon the"
edgarallanpoe,"stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved"
edgarallanpoe,by the evidence. This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether
edgarallanpoe,the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have
edgarallanpoe,committed suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method;
edgarallanpoe,for the strength of Madame L’Espanaye would have been utterly unequal
edgarallanpoe,to the task of thrusting her daughter’s corpse up the chimney as it
edgarallanpoe,was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely
edgarallanpoe,"preclude the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed"
edgarallanpoe,by some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard
edgarallanpoe,in contention. Let me now advert--not to the whole testimony respecting
edgarallanpoe,these voices--but to what was _peculiar_ in that testimony. Did you
edgarallanpoe,observe any thing peculiar about it?”
edgarallanpoe,"I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff"
edgarallanpoe,"voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard"
edgarallanpoe,"to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice."
edgarallanpoe,"“That was the evidence itself,” said Dupin, “but it was not the"
edgarallanpoe,peculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing distinctive.
edgarallanpoe,"Yet there _was_ something to be observed. The witnesses, as you remark,"
edgarallanpoe,agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. But in regard to
edgarallanpoe,"the shrill voice, the peculiarity is--not that they disagreed--but"
edgarallanpoe,"that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a"
edgarallanpoe,"Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that _of"
edgarallanpoe,a foreigner_. Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own
edgarallanpoe,countrymen. Each likens it--not to the voice of an individual of any
edgarallanpoe,nation with whose language he is conversant--but the converse.
edgarallanpoe,"The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and ‘might have"
edgarallanpoe,distinguished some words _had he been acquainted with the Spanish._’ The
edgarallanpoe,Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it
edgarallanpoe,stated that ‘_not understanding French this witness was examined through
edgarallanpoe,"an interpreter._’ The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and"
edgarallanpoe,‘_does not understand German._’ The Spaniard ‘is sure’ that it was that
edgarallanpoe,"of an Englishman, but ‘judges by the intonation’ altogether, ‘_as he has"
edgarallanpoe,no knowledge of the English._’ The Italian believes it the voice of a
edgarallanpoe,"Russian, but ‘_has never conversed with a native of Russia._’ A second"
edgarallanpoe,"Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the"
edgarallanpoe,"voice was that of an Italian; but, _not being cognizant of that tongue_,"
edgarallanpoe,"is, like the Spaniard, ‘convinced by the intonation.’ Now, how strangely"
edgarallanpoe,"unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as"
edgarallanpoe,"this _could_ have been elicited!--in whose _tones_, even, denizens of"
edgarallanpoe,the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar! You
edgarallanpoe,will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic--of an African.
edgarallanpoe,"Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the"
edgarallanpoe,"inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points."
edgarallanpoe,The voice is termed by one witness ‘harsh rather than shrill.’ It
edgarallanpoe,is represented by two others to have been ‘quick and _unequal._’ No
edgarallanpoe,words--no sounds resembling words--were by any witness mentioned as
edgarallanpoe,distinguishable.
edgarallanpoe,"“I know not,” continued Dupin, “what impression I may have made, so"
edgarallanpoe,"far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that"
edgarallanpoe,legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony--the
edgarallanpoe,portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices--are in themselves
edgarallanpoe,sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all
edgarallanpoe,farther progress in the investigation of the mystery. I said ‘legitimate
edgarallanpoe,deductions;’ but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed
edgarallanpoe,"to imply that the deductions are the _sole_ proper ones, and that the"
edgarallanpoe,suspicion arises _inevitably_ from them as the single result. What the
edgarallanpoe,"suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to"
edgarallanpoe,"bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a"
edgarallanpoe,definite form--a certain tendency--to my inquiries in the chamber.
edgarallanpoe,"“Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall"
edgarallanpoe,we first seek here? The means of egress employed by the murderers. It is
edgarallanpoe,not too much to say that neither of us believe in præternatural events.
edgarallanpoe,Madame and Mademoiselle L’Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. The
edgarallanpoe,"doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. Then how?"
edgarallanpoe,"Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that"
edgarallanpoe,"mode _must_ lead us to a definite decision.--Let us examine, each by"
edgarallanpoe,"each, the possible means of egress. It is clear that the assassins were"
edgarallanpoe,"in the room where Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was found, or at least in the"
edgarallanpoe,"room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only from"
edgarallanpoe,these two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have laid
edgarallanpoe,"bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every"
edgarallanpoe,"direction. No _secret_ issues could have escaped their vigilance. But,"
edgarallanpoe,"not trusting to _their_ eyes, I examined with my own. There were, then,"
edgarallanpoe,no secret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage
edgarallanpoe,"were securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys."
edgarallanpoe,"These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the"
edgarallanpoe,"hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large"
edgarallanpoe,"cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus"
edgarallanpoe,"absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room"
edgarallanpoe,no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street.
edgarallanpoe,"The murderers _must_ have passed, then, through those of the back room."
edgarallanpoe,"Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are,"
edgarallanpoe,"it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent"
edgarallanpoe,impossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these apparent
edgarallanpoe,"‘impossibilities’ are, in reality, not such."
edgarallanpoe,“There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by
edgarallanpoe,"furniture, and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is"
edgarallanpoe,hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust
edgarallanpoe,close up against it. The former was found securely fastened from within.
edgarallanpoe,It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A
edgarallanpoe,"large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very"
edgarallanpoe,"stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining"
edgarallanpoe,"the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and"
edgarallanpoe,"a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police were now"
edgarallanpoe,"entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. And,"
edgarallanpoe,"_therefore_, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the"
edgarallanpoe,nails and open the windows.
edgarallanpoe,"“My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the"
edgarallanpoe,"reason I have just given--because here it was, I knew, that all apparent"
edgarallanpoe,impossibilities _must_ be proved to be not such in reality.
edgarallanpoe,“I proceeded to think thus--_a posteriori_. The murderers did escape
edgarallanpoe,"from one of these windows. This being so, they could not have refastened"
edgarallanpoe,"the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened;--the"
edgarallanpoe,"consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny"
edgarallanpoe,of the police in this quarter. Yet the sashes _were_ fastened. They
edgarallanpoe,"_must_, then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no"
edgarallanpoe,"escape from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement,"
edgarallanpoe,withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash.
edgarallanpoe,"It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated. A concealed spring"
edgarallanpoe,"must, I now know, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced"
edgarallanpoe,"me that my premises at least, were correct, however mysterious still"
edgarallanpoe,appeared the circumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon
edgarallanpoe,"brought to light the hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with"
edgarallanpoe,"the discovery, forbore to upraise the sash."
edgarallanpoe,“I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing
edgarallanpoe,"out through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would"
edgarallanpoe,have caught--but the nail could not have been replaced. The conclusion
edgarallanpoe,"was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations. The"
edgarallanpoe,"assassins _must_ have escaped through the other window. Supposing, then,"
edgarallanpoe,"the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there _must_"
edgarallanpoe,"be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes"
edgarallanpoe,"of their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked"
edgarallanpoe,over the head-board minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand
edgarallanpoe,"down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring,"
edgarallanpoe,"which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor."
edgarallanpoe,"I now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently"
edgarallanpoe,fitted in the same manner--driven in nearly up to the head.
edgarallanpoe,"“You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have"
edgarallanpoe,"misunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase,"
edgarallanpoe,I had not been once ‘at fault.’ The scent had never for an instant
edgarallanpoe,been lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the
edgarallanpoe,"secret to its ultimate result,--and that result was _the nail._ It"
edgarallanpoe,"had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other"
edgarallanpoe,window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive us it might
edgarallanpoe,"seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this"
edgarallanpoe,"point, terminated the clew. ‘There _must_ be something wrong,’ I said,"
edgarallanpoe,"‘about the nail.’ I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an"
edgarallanpoe,"inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in"
edgarallanpoe,the gimlet-hole where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old
edgarallanpoe,"one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been"
edgarallanpoe,"accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded,"
edgarallanpoe,"in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. I now"
edgarallanpoe,carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had
edgarallanpoe,"taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete--the"
edgarallanpoe,"fissure was invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash"
edgarallanpoe,"for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed."
edgarallanpoe,"I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again"
edgarallanpoe,perfect.
edgarallanpoe,"“The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through"
edgarallanpoe,the window which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon
edgarallanpoe,"his exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the"
edgarallanpoe,spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken
edgarallanpoe,"by the police for that of the nail,--farther inquiry being thus"
edgarallanpoe,considered unnecessary.
edgarallanpoe,“The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had
edgarallanpoe,been satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet
edgarallanpoe,and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod.
edgarallanpoe,From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the
edgarallanpoe,"window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that"
edgarallanpoe,the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by
edgarallanpoe,Parisian carpenters _ferrades_--a kind rarely employed at the present
edgarallanpoe,"day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux."
edgarallanpoe,"They are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door)"
edgarallanpoe,except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis--thus
edgarallanpoe,affording an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these
edgarallanpoe,shutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from
edgarallanpoe,"the rear of the house, they were both about half open--that is to say,"
edgarallanpoe,they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the
edgarallanpoe,"police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if"
edgarallanpoe,"so, in looking at these _ferrades_ in the line of their breadth (as they"
edgarallanpoe,"must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or,"
edgarallanpoe,"at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having"
edgarallanpoe,once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this
edgarallanpoe,"quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination."
edgarallanpoe,"It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window"
edgarallanpoe,"at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach"
edgarallanpoe,"to within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by"
edgarallanpoe,"exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance"
edgarallanpoe,"into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected.--By"
edgarallanpoe,reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the
edgarallanpoe,shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp
edgarallanpoe,"upon the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing"
edgarallanpoe,"his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he"
edgarallanpoe,"might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the"
edgarallanpoe,"window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room."
edgarallanpoe,“I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a _very_
edgarallanpoe,unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and
edgarallanpoe,"so difficult a feat. It is my design to show you, first, that the thing"
edgarallanpoe,"might possibly have been accomplished:--but, secondly and _chiefly_, I"
edgarallanpoe,wish to impress upon your understanding the _very extraordinary_--the
edgarallanpoe,almost præternatural character of that agility which could have
edgarallanpoe,accomplished it.
edgarallanpoe,"“You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that ‘to make"
edgarallanpoe,"out my case,’ I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a full"
edgarallanpoe,estimation of the activity required in this matter. This may be the
edgarallanpoe,"practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason. My ultimate object"
edgarallanpoe,is only the truth. My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in
edgarallanpoe,"juxtaposition, that _very unusual_ activity of which I have just spoken"
edgarallanpoe,"with that _very peculiar_ shrill (or harsh) and _unequal_ voice, about"
edgarallanpoe,"whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose"
edgarallanpoe,utterance no syllabification could be detected.”
edgarallanpoe,At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning
edgarallanpoe,of Dupin flitted over my mind. I seemed to be upon the verge of
edgarallanpoe,"comprehension without power to comprehend--men, at times, find"
edgarallanpoe,"themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able, in the end,"
edgarallanpoe,to remember. My friend went on with his discourse.
edgarallanpoe,"“You will see,” he said, “that I have shifted the question from the mode"
edgarallanpoe,of egress to that of ingress. It was my design to convey the idea that
edgarallanpoe,"both were effected in the same manner, at the same point. Let us now"
edgarallanpoe,revert to the interior of the room. Let us survey the appearances here.
edgarallanpoe,"The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many"
edgarallanpoe,articles of apparel still remained within them. The conclusion here is
edgarallanpoe,absurd. It is a mere guess--a very silly one--and no more. How are
edgarallanpoe,we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these
edgarallanpoe,drawers had originally contained? Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter
edgarallanpoe,lived an exceedingly retired life--saw no company--seldom went out--had
edgarallanpoe,little use for numerous changes of habiliment. Those found were at least
edgarallanpoe,of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies. If a
edgarallanpoe,"thief had taken any, why did he not take the best--why did he not take"
edgarallanpoe,"all? In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to"
edgarallanpoe,encumber himself with a bundle of linen? The gold _was _abandoned.
edgarallanpoe,"Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was"
edgarallanpoe,"discovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you, therefore, to discard"
edgarallanpoe,"from your thoughts the blundering idea of _motive_, engendered in the"
edgarallanpoe,brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of
edgarallanpoe,money delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences ten times as
edgarallanpoe,"remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed"
edgarallanpoe,"within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us"
edgarallanpoe,"every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice."
edgarallanpoe,"Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that"
edgarallanpoe,class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory
edgarallanpoe,of probabilities--that theory to which the most glorious objects of
edgarallanpoe,human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration. In
edgarallanpoe,"the present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery"
edgarallanpoe,three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence.
edgarallanpoe,"It would have been corroborative of this idea of motive. But, under the"
edgarallanpoe,"real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive"
edgarallanpoe,"of this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an"
edgarallanpoe,idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together.
edgarallanpoe,“Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your
edgarallanpoe,"attention--that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling"
edgarallanpoe,absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this--let us
edgarallanpoe,glance at the butchery itself. Here is a woman strangled to death
edgarallanpoe,"by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward. Ordinary"
edgarallanpoe,"assassins employ no such modes of murder as this. Least of all, do they"
edgarallanpoe,thus dispose of the murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse
edgarallanpoe,"up the chimney, you will admit that there was something _excessively"
edgarallanpoe,outré_--something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of
edgarallanpoe,"human action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men."
edgarallanpoe,"Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have"
edgarallanpoe,thrust the body _up_ such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor
edgarallanpoe,of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it _down!_
edgarallanpoe,"“Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most"
edgarallanpoe,marvellous. On the hearth were thick tresses--very thick tresses--of
edgarallanpoe,grey human hair. These had been torn out by the roots. You are aware of
edgarallanpoe,the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or
edgarallanpoe,thirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well as myself.
edgarallanpoe,Their roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh
edgarallanpoe,of the scalp--sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted
edgarallanpoe,in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of
edgarallanpoe,"the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from"
edgarallanpoe,the body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at
edgarallanpoe,the _brutal_ ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body
edgarallanpoe,"of Madame L’Espanaye I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy"
edgarallanpoe,"coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by"
edgarallanpoe,some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. The
edgarallanpoe,"obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which"
edgarallanpoe,the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed. This
edgarallanpoe,"idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same"
edgarallanpoe,"reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them--because, by the"
edgarallanpoe,"affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed"
edgarallanpoe,against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.
edgarallanpoe,"“If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected"
edgarallanpoe,"upon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine"
edgarallanpoe,"the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity"
edgarallanpoe,"brutal, a butchery without motive, a _grotesquerie_ in horror absolutely"
edgarallanpoe,"alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men"
edgarallanpoe,"of many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible"
edgarallanpoe,"syllabification. What result, then, has ensued? What impression have I"
edgarallanpoe,made upon your fancy?”
edgarallanpoe,I felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question. “A
edgarallanpoe,"madman,” I said, “has done this deed--some raving maniac, escaped from a"
edgarallanpoe,neighboring _Maison de Santé._”
edgarallanpoe,"“In some respects,” he replied, “your idea is not irrelevant. But the"
edgarallanpoe,"voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to"
edgarallanpoe,tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs. Madmen are of some
edgarallanpoe,"nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always"
edgarallanpoe,"the coherence of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman is not"
edgarallanpoe,such as I now hold in my hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the
edgarallanpoe,rigidly clutched fingers of Madame L’Espanaye. Tell me what you can make
edgarallanpoe,of it.”
edgarallanpoe,"“Dupin!” I said, completely unnerved; “this hair is most unusual--this"
edgarallanpoe,is no _human_ hair.”
edgarallanpoe,"“I have not asserted that it is,” said he; “but, before we decide this"
edgarallanpoe,"point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon"
edgarallanpoe,this paper. It is a _fac-simile_ drawing of what has been described in
edgarallanpoe,"one portion of the testimony as ‘dark bruises, and deep indentations"
edgarallanpoe,"of finger nails,’ upon the throat of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and in"
edgarallanpoe,"another, (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,) as a ‘series of livid spots,"
edgarallanpoe,evidently the impression of fingers.’
edgarallanpoe,"“You will perceive,” continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon"
edgarallanpoe,"the table before us, “that this drawing gives the idea of a firm"
edgarallanpoe,and fixed hold. There is no _slipping_ apparent. Each finger has
edgarallanpoe,retained--possibly until the death of the victim--the fearful grasp by
edgarallanpoe,"which it originally imbedded itself. Attempt, now, to place all your"
edgarallanpoe,"fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see"
edgarallanpoe,them.”
edgarallanpoe,I made the attempt in vain.
edgarallanpoe,"“We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,” he said. “The"
edgarallanpoe,paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is
edgarallanpoe,"cylindrical. Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which"
edgarallanpoe,"is about that of the throat. Wrap the drawing around it, and try the"
edgarallanpoe,experiment again.”
edgarallanpoe,"I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before. “This,”"
edgarallanpoe,"I said, “is the mark of no human hand.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Read now,” replied Dupin, “this passage from Cuvier.”"
edgarallanpoe,It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the
edgarallanpoe,large fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic
edgarallanpoe,"stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and"
edgarallanpoe,the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known
edgarallanpoe,to all. I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.
edgarallanpoe,"“The description of the digits,” said I, as I made an end of reading,"
edgarallanpoe,“is in exact accordance with this drawing. I see that no animal but an
edgarallanpoe,"Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the"
edgarallanpoe,"indentations as you have traced them. This tuft of tawny hair, too, is"
edgarallanpoe,identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot
edgarallanpoe,"possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery. Besides,"
edgarallanpoe,"there were _two_ voices heard in contention, and one of them was"
edgarallanpoe,unquestionably the voice of a Frenchman.”
edgarallanpoe,“True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost
edgarallanpoe,"unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice,--the expression, ‘_mon"
edgarallanpoe,"Dieu!_’ This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by"
edgarallanpoe,"one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of"
edgarallanpoe,"remonstrance or expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I have"
edgarallanpoe,mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman
edgarallanpoe,was cognizant of the murder. It is possible--indeed it is far more
edgarallanpoe,than probable--that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody
edgarallanpoe,transactions which took place. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from
edgarallanpoe,"him. He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating"
edgarallanpoe,"circumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it. It is"
edgarallanpoe,still at large. I will not pursue these guesses--for I have no right to
edgarallanpoe,call them more--since the shades of reflection upon which they are based
edgarallanpoe,"are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect,"
edgarallanpoe,and since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the
edgarallanpoe,"understanding of another. We will call them guesses then, and speak"
edgarallanpoe,"of them as such. If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose,"
edgarallanpoe,"innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement which I left last night,"
edgarallanpoe,"upon our return home, at the office of ‘Le Monde,’ (a paper devoted to"
edgarallanpoe,"the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors,) will bring him to"
edgarallanpoe,our residence.”
edgarallanpoe,"He handed me a paper, and I read thus:"
edgarallanpoe,"CAUGHT--_In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the--inst.,_"
edgarallanpoe,"(the morning of the murder,) _a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of"
edgarallanpoe,"the Bornese species. The owner, (who is ascertained to be a sailor,"
edgarallanpoe,"belonging to a Maltese vessel,) may have the animal again, upon"
edgarallanpoe,"identifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from"
edgarallanpoe,"its capture and keeping. Call at No. ----, Rue ----, Faubourg St."
edgarallanpoe,Germain--au troisiême._
edgarallanpoe,"“How was it possible,” I asked, “that you should know the man to be a"
edgarallanpoe,"sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?”"
edgarallanpoe,"“I do _not_ know it,” said Dupin. “I am not _sure_ of it. Here, however,"
edgarallanpoe,"is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy"
edgarallanpoe,"appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those"
edgarallanpoe,"long _queues_ of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one"
edgarallanpoe,"which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. I"
edgarallanpoe,picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod. It could not have
edgarallanpoe,"belonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my"
edgarallanpoe,"induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to"
edgarallanpoe,"a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in"
edgarallanpoe,"the advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have"
edgarallanpoe,been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble
edgarallanpoe,"to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant"
edgarallanpoe,"although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate"
edgarallanpoe,about replying to the advertisement--about demanding the Ourang-Outang.
edgarallanpoe,He will reason thus:--‘I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of
edgarallanpoe,great value--to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself--why should
edgarallanpoe,"I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my"
edgarallanpoe,grasp. It was found in the Bois de Boulogne--at a vast distance from the
edgarallanpoe,scene of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast
edgarallanpoe,should have done the deed? The police are at fault--they have failed to
edgarallanpoe,"procure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would"
edgarallanpoe,"be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me"
edgarallanpoe,"in guilt on account of that cognizance. Above all, _I am known._ The"
edgarallanpoe,advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast. I am not sure to
edgarallanpoe,what limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property
edgarallanpoe,"of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the"
edgarallanpoe,"animal at least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract"
edgarallanpoe,attention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer the
edgarallanpoe,"advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this"
edgarallanpoe,matter has blown over.’”
edgarallanpoe,At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.
edgarallanpoe,"“Be ready,” said Dupin, “with your pistols, but neither use them nor"
edgarallanpoe,show them until at a signal from myself.”
edgarallanpoe,"The front door of the house had been left open, and the visiter had"
edgarallanpoe,"entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase."
edgarallanpoe,"Now, however, he seemed to hesitate. Presently we heard him descending."
edgarallanpoe,"Dupin was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up."
edgarallanpoe,"He did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision, and"
edgarallanpoe,rapped at the door of our chamber.
edgarallanpoe,"“Come in,” said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone."
edgarallanpoe,"A man entered. He was a sailor, evidently,--a tall, stout, and"
edgarallanpoe,"muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of"
edgarallanpoe,"countenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburnt,"
edgarallanpoe,was more than half hidden by whisker and _mustachio._ He had with him
edgarallanpoe,"a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed. He bowed"
edgarallanpoe,"awkwardly, and bade us “good evening,” in French accents, which,"
edgarallanpoe,"although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a"
edgarallanpoe,Parisian origin.
edgarallanpoe,"“Sit down, my friend,” said Dupin. “I suppose you have called about the"
edgarallanpoe,"Ourang-Outang. Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him;"
edgarallanpoe,"a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal. How old do you"
edgarallanpoe,suppose him to be?”
edgarallanpoe,"The sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some"
edgarallanpoe,"intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:"
edgarallanpoe,“I have no way of telling--but he can’t be more than four or five years
edgarallanpoe,old. Have you got him here?”
edgarallanpoe,"“Oh no, we had no conveniences for keeping him here. He is at a livery"
edgarallanpoe,"stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by. You can get him in the morning. Of"
edgarallanpoe,course you are prepared to identify the property?”
edgarallanpoe,"“To be sure I am, sir.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“I shall be sorry to part with him,” said Dupin."
edgarallanpoe,"“I don’t mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir,”"
edgarallanpoe,said the man. “Couldn’t expect it. Am very willing to pay a reward for
edgarallanpoe,"the finding of the animal--that is to say, any thing in reason.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“Well,” replied my friend, “that is all very fair, to be sure. Let me"
edgarallanpoe,think!--what should I have? Oh! I will tell you. My reward shall be
edgarallanpoe,this. You shall give me all the information in your power about these
edgarallanpoe,murders in the Rue Morgue.”
edgarallanpoe,"Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just as"
edgarallanpoe,"quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it and put the key in"
edgarallanpoe,"his pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without"
edgarallanpoe,"the least flurry, upon the table."
edgarallanpoe,The sailor’s face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation.
edgarallanpoe,"He started to his feet and grasped his cudgel, but the next moment he"
edgarallanpoe,"fell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance"
edgarallanpoe,of death itself. He spoke not a word. I pitied him from the bottom of my
edgarallanpoe,heart.
edgarallanpoe,"“My friend,” said Dupin, in a kind tone, “you are alarming yourself"
edgarallanpoe,unnecessarily--you are indeed. We mean you no harm whatever. I pledge
edgarallanpoe,"you the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no"
edgarallanpoe,injury. I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities
edgarallanpoe,"in the Rue Morgue. It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some"
edgarallanpoe,"measure implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know"
edgarallanpoe,that I have had means of information about this matter--means of which
edgarallanpoe,you could never have dreamed. Now the thing stands thus. You have done
edgarallanpoe,"nothing which you could have avoided--nothing, certainly, which renders"
edgarallanpoe,"you culpable. You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have"
edgarallanpoe,robbed with impunity. You have nothing to conceal. You have no reason
edgarallanpoe,"for concealment. On the other hand, you are bound by every principle"
edgarallanpoe,"of honor to confess all you know. An innocent man is now imprisoned,"
edgarallanpoe,charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator.”
edgarallanpoe,"The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while"
edgarallanpoe,Dupin uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all
edgarallanpoe,gone.
edgarallanpoe,"“So help me God,” said he, after a brief pause, “I will tell you all I"
edgarallanpoe,know about this affair;--but I do not expect you to believe one half I
edgarallanpoe,"say--I would be a fool indeed if I did. Still, I am innocent, and I will"
edgarallanpoe,make a clean breast if I die for it.”
edgarallanpoe,"What he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage"
edgarallanpoe,"to the Indian Archipelago. A party, of which he formed one, landed"
edgarallanpoe,"at Borneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure."
edgarallanpoe,Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang-Outang. This companion
edgarallanpoe,"dying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession. After great"
edgarallanpoe,"trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during"
edgarallanpoe,"the home voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own"
edgarallanpoe,"residence in Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant"
edgarallanpoe,"curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such"
edgarallanpoe,"time as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a"
edgarallanpoe,splinter on board ship. His ultimate design was to sell it.
edgarallanpoe,"Returning home from some sailors’ frolic the night, or rather in the"
edgarallanpoe,"morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room,"
edgarallanpoe,"into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as"
edgarallanpoe,"was thought, securely confined. Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it"
edgarallanpoe,"was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving,"
edgarallanpoe,in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the
edgarallanpoe,key-hole of the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon
edgarallanpoe,"in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use"
edgarallanpoe,"it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been"
edgarallanpoe,"accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods,"
edgarallanpoe,"by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of it, the"
edgarallanpoe,"Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down"
edgarallanpoe,"the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the"
edgarallanpoe,street.
edgarallanpoe,"The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand,"
edgarallanpoe,"occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until"
edgarallanpoe,the latter had nearly come up with it. It then again made off. In this
edgarallanpoe,manner the chase continued for a long time. The streets were profoundly
edgarallanpoe,"quiet, as it was nearly three o’clock in the morning. In passing down"
edgarallanpoe,"an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive’s attention was"
edgarallanpoe,arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L’Espanaye’s
edgarallanpoe,"chamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it"
edgarallanpoe,"perceived the lightning rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility,"
edgarallanpoe,"grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed. The"
edgarallanpoe,whole feat did not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open again by
edgarallanpoe,the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.
edgarallanpoe,"The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had"
edgarallanpoe,"strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape"
edgarallanpoe,"from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it"
edgarallanpoe,"might be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was"
edgarallanpoe,much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter
edgarallanpoe,reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning rod
edgarallanpoe,"is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had"
edgarallanpoe,"arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was"
edgarallanpoe,stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to
edgarallanpoe,obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly
edgarallanpoe,fell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that those
edgarallanpoe,"hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber"
edgarallanpoe,"the inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter,"
edgarallanpoe,"habited in their night clothes, had apparently been occupied in"
edgarallanpoe,"arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had"
edgarallanpoe,"been wheeled into the middle of the room. It was open, and its contents"
edgarallanpoe,lay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with
edgarallanpoe,"their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the"
edgarallanpoe,"ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not"
edgarallanpoe,immediately perceived. The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally
edgarallanpoe,have been attributed to the wind.
edgarallanpoe,"As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame"
edgarallanpoe,"L’Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing"
edgarallanpoe,"it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the"
edgarallanpoe,motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had
edgarallanpoe,swooned. The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the
edgarallanpoe,hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably
edgarallanpoe,pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one
edgarallanpoe,determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her
edgarallanpoe,body. The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its
edgarallanpoe,"teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the"
edgarallanpoe,"girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp"
edgarallanpoe,until she expired. Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment
edgarallanpoe,"upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with"
edgarallanpoe,"horror, was just discernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore"
edgarallanpoe,"still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear."
edgarallanpoe,"Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of"
edgarallanpoe,"concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony"
edgarallanpoe,of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it
edgarallanpoe,"moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In conclusion, it seized"
edgarallanpoe,"first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as"
edgarallanpoe,"it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled"
edgarallanpoe,through the window headlong.
edgarallanpoe,"As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor"
edgarallanpoe,"shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it,"
edgarallanpoe,"hurried at once home--dreading the consequences of the butchery, and"
edgarallanpoe,"gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the"
edgarallanpoe,Ourang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the
edgarallanpoe,"Frenchman’s exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the"
edgarallanpoe,fiendish jabberings of the brute.
edgarallanpoe,I have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have escaped
edgarallanpoe,"from the chamber, by the rod, just before the break of the door. It"
edgarallanpoe,must have closed the window as it passed through it. It was subsequently
edgarallanpoe,"caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the"
edgarallanpoe,"_Jardin des Plantes._ Le Don was instantly released, upon our narration"
edgarallanpoe,of the circumstances (with some comments from Dupin) at the bureau of
edgarallanpoe,"the Prefect of Police. This functionary, however well disposed to my"
edgarallanpoe,"friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which"
edgarallanpoe,"affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about"
edgarallanpoe,the propriety of every person minding his own business.
edgarallanpoe,"“Let him talk,” said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply."
edgarallanpoe,"“Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience, I am satisfied with"
edgarallanpoe,"having defeated him in his own castle. Nevertheless, that he failed"
edgarallanpoe,"in the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder"
edgarallanpoe,"which he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat"
edgarallanpoe,too cunning to be profound. In his wisdom is no _stamen._ It is all head
edgarallanpoe,"and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna,--or, at best, all"
edgarallanpoe,"head and shoulders, like a codfish. But he is a good creature after all."
edgarallanpoe,"I like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has"
edgarallanpoe,attained his reputation for ingenuity. I mean the way he has ‘_de nier
edgarallanpoe,"ce qui est, et d’expliquer ce qui n’est pas._’” (*)"

edgarallanpoe,A SEQUEL TO “THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.”
edgarallanpoe,"Es giebt eine Reihe idealischer Begebenheiten, die der Wirklichkeit"
edgarallanpoe,parallel lauft. Selten fallen sie zusammen. Menschen und zufalle
edgarallanpoe,"modifieiren gewohulich die idealische Begebenheit, so dass sie"
edgarallanpoe,"unvollkommen erscheint, und ihre Folgen gleichfalls unvollkommen"
edgarallanpoe,sind. So bei der Reformation; statt des Protestantismus kam das

edgarallanpoe,There are ideal series of events which run parallel with the real
edgarallanpoe,ones. They rarely coincide. Men and circumstances generally modify
edgarallanpoe,"the ideal train of events, so that it seems imperfect, and its"
edgarallanpoe,consequences are equally imperfect. Thus with the Reformation;
edgarallanpoe,instead of Protestantism came Lutheranism.
edgarallanpoe,--Novalis. (*2) Moral Ansichten.
edgarallanpoe,"THERE are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who have not"
edgarallanpoe,occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling half-credence in
edgarallanpoe,"the supernatural, by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character"
edgarallanpoe,"that, as mere coincidences, the intellect has been unable to receive"
edgarallanpoe,them. Such sentiments--for the half-credences of which I speak have
edgarallanpoe,never the full force of thought--such sentiments are seldom thoroughly
edgarallanpoe,"stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is"
edgarallanpoe,"technically termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. Now this Calculus is,"
edgarallanpoe,"in its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the"
edgarallanpoe,most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of
edgarallanpoe,the most intangible in speculation.
edgarallanpoe,"The extraordinary details which I am now called upon to make public,"
edgarallanpoe,"will be found to form, as regards sequence of time, the primary branch"
edgarallanpoe,"of a series of scarcely intelligible coincidences, whose secondary or"
edgarallanpoe,concluding branch will be recognized by all readers in the late murder
edgarallanpoe,"of Mary Cecila Rogers, at New York."
edgarallanpoe,"When, in an article entitled “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” I"
edgarallanpoe,"endeavored, about a year ago, to depict some very remarkable features"
edgarallanpoe,"in the mental character of my friend, the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin,"
edgarallanpoe,it did not occur to me that I should ever resume the subject. This
edgarallanpoe,depicting of character constituted my design; and this design was
edgarallanpoe,thoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of circumstances brought to
edgarallanpoe,"instance Dupin’s idiosyncrasy. I might have adduced other examples, but"
edgarallanpoe,"I should have proven no more. Late events, however, in their surprising"
edgarallanpoe,"development, have startled me into some farther details, which will"
edgarallanpoe,carry with them the air of extorted confession. Hearing what I have
edgarallanpoe,"lately heard, it would be indeed strange should I remain silent in"
edgarallanpoe,regard to what I both heard and saw so long ago.
edgarallanpoe,Upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of Madame
edgarallanpoe,"L’Espanaye and her daughter, the Chevalier dismissed the affair at once"
edgarallanpoe,"from his attention, and relapsed into his old habits of moody reverie."
edgarallanpoe,"Prone, at all times, to abstraction, I readily fell in with his humor;"
edgarallanpoe,"and, continuing to occupy our chambers in the Faubourg Saint Germain, we"
edgarallanpoe,"gave the Future to the winds, and slumbered tranquilly in the Present,"
edgarallanpoe,weaving the dull world around us into dreams.
edgarallanpoe,But these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted. It may readily be
edgarallanpoe,"supposed that the part played by my friend, in the drama at the Rue"
edgarallanpoe,"Morgue, had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the"
edgarallanpoe,"Parisian police. With its emissaries, the name of Dupin had grown into a"
edgarallanpoe,household word. The simple character of those inductions by which he
edgarallanpoe,had disentangled the mystery never having been explained even to the
edgarallanpoe,"Prefect, or to any other individual than myself, of course it is not"
edgarallanpoe,"surprising that the affair was regarded as little less than miraculous,"
edgarallanpoe,or that the Chevalier’s analytical abilities acquired for him the
edgarallanpoe,credit of intuition. His frankness would have led him to disabuse every
edgarallanpoe,inquirer of such prejudice; but his indolent humor forbade all farther
edgarallanpoe,agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long ceased. It thus
edgarallanpoe,happened that he found himself the cynosure of the political eyes; and
edgarallanpoe,the cases were not few in which attempt was made to engage his services
edgarallanpoe,at the Prefecture. One of the most remarkable instances was that of the
edgarallanpoe,murder of a young girl named Marie Rogêt.
edgarallanpoe,This event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the Rue
edgarallanpoe,"Morgue. Marie, whose Christian and family name will at once arrest"
edgarallanpoe,attention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate
edgarallanpoe,"“cigargirl,” was the only daughter of the widow Estelle Rogêt. The"
edgarallanpoe,"father had died during the child’s infancy, and from the period of his"
edgarallanpoe,"death, until within eighteen months before the assassination which forms"
edgarallanpoe,"the subject of our narrative, the mother and daughter had dwelt together"
edgarallanpoe,"in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée; (*3) Madame there keeping a pension,"
edgarallanpoe,assisted by Marie. Affairs went on thus until the latter had attained
edgarallanpoe,"her twenty-second year, when her great beauty attracted the notice of a"
edgarallanpoe,"perfumer, who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the Palais"
edgarallanpoe,"Royal, and whose custom lay chiefly among the desperate adventurers"
edgarallanpoe,infesting that neighborhood. Monsieur Le Blanc (*4) was not unaware of
edgarallanpoe,the advantages to be derived from the attendance of the fair Marie in
edgarallanpoe,his perfumery; and his liberal proposals were accepted eagerly by the
edgarallanpoe,"girl, although with somewhat more of hesitation by Madame."
edgarallanpoe,"The anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized, and his rooms soon"
edgarallanpoe,became notorious through the charms of the sprightly grisette. She had
edgarallanpoe,"been in his employ about a year, when her admirers were thrown info"
edgarallanpoe,confusion by her sudden disappearance from the shop. Monsieur Le Blanc
edgarallanpoe,"was unable to account for her absence, and Madame Rogêt was distracted"
edgarallanpoe,with anxiety and terror. The public papers immediately took up
edgarallanpoe,"the theme, and the police were upon the point of making serious"
edgarallanpoe,"investigations, when, one fine morning, after the lapse of a week,"
edgarallanpoe,"Marie, in good health, but with a somewhat saddened air, made her"
edgarallanpoe,"re-appearance at her usual counter in the perfumery. All inquiry, except"
edgarallanpoe,"that of a private character, was of course immediately hushed. Monsieur"
edgarallanpoe,"Le Blanc professed total ignorance, as before. Marie, with Madame,"
edgarallanpoe,"replied to all questions, that the last week had been spent at the"
edgarallanpoe,"house of a relation in the country. Thus the affair died away, and was"
edgarallanpoe,"generally forgotten; for the girl, ostensibly to relieve herself from"
edgarallanpoe,"the impertinence of curiosity, soon bade a final adieu to the perfumer,"
edgarallanpoe,and sought the shelter of her mother’s residence in the Rue Pavée Saint
edgarallanpoe,Andrée.
edgarallanpoe,"It was about five months after this return home, that her friends were"
edgarallanpoe,alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time. Three days
edgarallanpoe,"elapsed, and nothing was heard of her. On the fourth her corpse was"
edgarallanpoe,"found floating in the Seine, * near the shore which is opposite the"
edgarallanpoe,"Quartier of the Rue Saint Andree, and at a point not very far distant"
edgarallanpoe,from the secluded neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule. (*6)
edgarallanpoe,"The atrocity of this murder, (for it was at once evident that murder had"
edgarallanpoe,"been committed,) the youth and beauty of the victim, and, above all, her"
edgarallanpoe,"previous notoriety, conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds"
edgarallanpoe,of the sensitive Parisians. I can call to mind no similar occurrence
edgarallanpoe,"producing so general and so intense an effect. For several weeks, in"
edgarallanpoe,"the discussion of this one absorbing theme, even the momentous political"
edgarallanpoe,topics of the day were forgotten. The Prefect made unusual exertions;
edgarallanpoe,"and the powers of the whole Parisian police were, of course, tasked to"
edgarallanpoe,the utmost extent.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed that the"
edgarallanpoe,"murderer would be able to elude, for more than a very brief period,"
edgarallanpoe,the inquisition which was immediately set on foot. It was not until the
edgarallanpoe,expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward; and
edgarallanpoe,even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs. In the mean time
edgarallanpoe,"the investigation proceeded with vigor, if not always with judgment, and"
edgarallanpoe,"numerous individuals were examined to no purpose; while, owing to the"
edgarallanpoe,"continual absence of all clue to the mystery, the popular excitement"
edgarallanpoe,greatly increased. At the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable
edgarallanpoe,"to double the sum originally proposed; and, at length, the second week"
edgarallanpoe,"having elapsed without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice"
edgarallanpoe,which always exists in Paris against the Police having given vent to
edgarallanpoe,"itself in several serious émeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself"
edgarallanpoe,to offer the sum of twenty thousand francs “for the conviction of the
edgarallanpoe,"assassin,” or, if more than one should prove to have been implicated,"
edgarallanpoe,“for the conviction of any one of the assassins.” In the proclamation
edgarallanpoe,"setting forth this reward, a full pardon was promised to any accomplice"
edgarallanpoe,who should come forward in evidence against his fellow; and to the whole
edgarallanpoe,"was appended, wherever it appeared, the private placard of a committee"
edgarallanpoe,"of citizens, offering ten thousand francs, in addition to the amount"
edgarallanpoe,proposed by the Prefecture. The entire reward thus stood at no less than
edgarallanpoe,"thirty thousand francs, which will be regarded as an extraordinary"
edgarallanpoe,"sum when we consider the humble condition of the girl, and the great"
edgarallanpoe,"frequency, in large cities, of such atrocities as the one described."
edgarallanpoe,No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately
edgarallanpoe,"brought to light. But although, in one or two instances, arrests were"
edgarallanpoe,"made which promised elucidation, yet nothing was elicited which could"
edgarallanpoe,implicate the parties suspected; and they were discharged forthwith.
edgarallanpoe,"Strange as it may appear, the third week from the discovery of the body"
edgarallanpoe,"had passed, and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject,"
edgarallanpoe,before even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public
edgarallanpoe,"mind, reached the ears of Dupin and myself. Engaged in researches which"
edgarallanpoe,"absorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month since either of"
edgarallanpoe,"us had gone abroad, or received a visiter, or more than glanced at"
edgarallanpoe,the leading political articles in one of the daily papers. The first
edgarallanpoe,"intelligence of the murder was brought us by G ----, in person. He"
edgarallanpoe,"called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of July, 18--,"
edgarallanpoe,and remained with us until late in the night. He had been piqued by
edgarallanpoe,the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins. His
edgarallanpoe,reputation--so he said with a peculiarly Parisian air--was at stake.
edgarallanpoe,Even his honor was concerned. The eyes of the public were upon him; and
edgarallanpoe,there was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for
edgarallanpoe,the development of the mystery. He concluded a somewhat droll speech
edgarallanpoe,"with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of Dupin,"
edgarallanpoe,"and made him a direct, and certainly a liberal proposition, the precise"
edgarallanpoe,"nature of which I do not feel myself at liberty to disclose, but which"
edgarallanpoe,has no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative.
edgarallanpoe,"The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the proposition"
edgarallanpoe,"he accepted at once, although its advantages were altogether"
edgarallanpoe,"provisional. This point being settled, the Prefect broke forth at"
edgarallanpoe,"once into explanations of his own views, interspersing them with"
edgarallanpoe,long comments upon the evidence; of which latter we were not yet in
edgarallanpoe,"possession. He discoursed much, and beyond doubt, learnedly; while"
edgarallanpoe,I hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away.
edgarallanpoe,"Dupin, sitting steadily in his accustomed arm-chair, was the embodiment"
edgarallanpoe,"of respectful attention. He wore spectacles, during the whole interview;"
edgarallanpoe,"and an occasional signal glance beneath their green glasses, sufficed"
edgarallanpoe,"to convince me that he slept not the less soundly, because silently,"
edgarallanpoe,throughout the seven or eight leaden-footed hours which immediately
edgarallanpoe,preceded the departure of the Prefect.
edgarallanpoe,"In the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report of all"
edgarallanpoe,"the evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper offices, a copy"
edgarallanpoe,"of every paper in which, from first to last, had been published any"
edgarallanpoe,decisive information in regard to this sad affair. Freed from all that
edgarallanpoe,"was positively disproved, this mass of information stood thus:"
edgarallanpoe,"Marie Rogêt left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pavée"
edgarallanpoe,"St. Andrée, about nine o’clock in the morning of Sunday June the"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty-second, 18--. In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur Jacques"
edgarallanpoe,"St. Eustache, (*7) and to him only, of her intent intention to spend the"
edgarallanpoe,day with an aunt who resided in the Rue des Drômes. The Rue des Drômes
edgarallanpoe,"is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare, not far from the banks"
edgarallanpoe,"of the river, and at a distance of some two miles, in the most direct"
edgarallanpoe,"course possible, from the pension of Madame Rogêt. St. Eustache was the"
edgarallanpoe,"accepted suitor of Marie, and lodged, as well as took his meals, at"
edgarallanpoe,"the pension. He was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to"
edgarallanpoe,"have escorted her home. In the afternoon, however, it came on to rain"
edgarallanpoe,"heavily; and, supposing that she would remain all night at her aunt’s,"
edgarallanpoe,"(as she had done under similar circumstances before,) he did not think"
edgarallanpoe,"it necessary to keep his promise. As night drew on, Madame Rogêt (who"
edgarallanpoe,"was an infirm old lady, seventy years of age,) was heard to express"
edgarallanpoe,a fear “that she should never see Marie again;” but this observation
edgarallanpoe,attracted little attention at the time.
edgarallanpoe,"On Monday, it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the Rue des"
edgarallanpoe,"Drômes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a tardy search"
edgarallanpoe,"was instituted at several points in the city, and its environs. It was"
edgarallanpoe,"not, however until the fourth day from the period of disappearance that"
edgarallanpoe,"any thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her. On this day,"
edgarallanpoe,"(Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of June,) a Monsieur Beauvais, (*8) who,"
edgarallanpoe,"with a friend, had been making inquiries for Marie near the Barrière"
edgarallanpoe,"du Roule, on the shore of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavée St."
edgarallanpoe,"Andrée, was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some"
edgarallanpoe,"fishermen, who had found it floating in the river. Upon seeing the"
edgarallanpoe,"body, Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it as that of the"
edgarallanpoe,perfumery-girl. His friend recognized it more promptly.
edgarallanpoe,"The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued from the"
edgarallanpoe,"mouth. No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely drowned. There was"
edgarallanpoe,no discoloration in the cellular tissue. About the throat were bruises
edgarallanpoe,and impressions of fingers. The arms were bent over on the chest and
edgarallanpoe,were rigid. The right hand was clenched; the left partially open. On
edgarallanpoe,"the left wrist were two circular excoriations, apparently the effect"
edgarallanpoe,"of ropes, or of a rope in more than one volution. A part of the right"
edgarallanpoe,"wrist, also, was much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent,"
edgarallanpoe,but more especially at the shoulder-blades. In bringing the body to
edgarallanpoe,the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope; but none of the
edgarallanpoe,excoriations had been effected by this. The flesh of the neck was much
edgarallanpoe,"swollen. There were no cuts apparent, or bruises which appeared the"
edgarallanpoe,effect of blows. A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the
edgarallanpoe,"neck as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried in the flesh,"
edgarallanpoe,and was fasted by a knot which lay just under the left ear. This alone
edgarallanpoe,would have sufficed to produce death. The medical testimony spoke
edgarallanpoe,confidently of the virtuous character of the deceased. She had been
edgarallanpoe,"subjected, it said, to brutal violence. The corpse was in such condition"
edgarallanpoe,"when found, that there could have been no difficulty in its recognition"
edgarallanpoe,by friends.
edgarallanpoe,"The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered. In the outer garment,"
edgarallanpoe,"a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to"
edgarallanpoe,"the waist, but not torn off. It was wound three times around the waist,"
edgarallanpoe,and secured by a sort of hitch in the back. The dress immediately
edgarallanpoe,beneath the frock was of fine muslin; and from this a slip eighteen
edgarallanpoe,inches wide had been torn entirely out--torn very evenly and with great
edgarallanpoe,"care. It was found around her neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a"
edgarallanpoe,"hard knot. Over this muslin slip and the slip of lace, the strings of a"
edgarallanpoe,bonnet were attached; the bonnet being appended. The knot by which the
edgarallanpoe,"strings of the bonnet were fastened, was not a lady’s, but a slip or"
edgarallanpoe,sailor’s knot.
edgarallanpoe,"After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken to the"
edgarallanpoe,"Morgue, (this formality being superfluous,) but hastily interred not far"
edgarallanpoe,from the spot at which it was brought ashore. Through the exertions of
edgarallanpoe,"Beauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as far as possible;"
edgarallanpoe,and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted. A
edgarallanpoe,"weekly paper, (*9) however, at length took up the theme; the corpse was"
edgarallanpoe,"disinterred, and a re-examination instituted; but nothing was elicited"
edgarallanpoe,"beyond what has been already noted. The clothes, however, were"
edgarallanpoe,"now submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased, and fully"
edgarallanpoe,identified as those worn by the girl upon leaving home.
edgarallanpoe,"Meantime, the excitement increased hourly. Several individuals were"
edgarallanpoe,arrested and discharged. St. Eustache fell especially under suspicion;
edgarallanpoe,"and he failed, at first, to give an intelligible account of his"
edgarallanpoe,"whereabouts during the Sunday on which Marie left home. Subsequently,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, he submitted to Monsieur G----, affidavits, accounting"
edgarallanpoe,satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question. As time passed and
edgarallanpoe,"no discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated,"
edgarallanpoe,"and journalists busied themselves in suggestions. Among these, the one"
edgarallanpoe,"which attracted the most notice, was the idea that Marie Rogêt still"
edgarallanpoe,lived--that the corpse found in the Seine was that of some other
edgarallanpoe,unfortunate. It will be proper that I submit to the reader some passages
edgarallanpoe,which embody the suggestion alluded to. These passages are literal
edgarallanpoe,"translations from L’Etoile, (*10) a paper conducted, in general, with"
edgarallanpoe,much ability.
edgarallanpoe,"“Mademoiselle Rogêt left her mother’s house on Sunday morning, June the"
edgarallanpoe,"twenty-second, 18--, with the ostensible purpose of going to see her"
edgarallanpoe,"aunt, or some other connexion, in the Rue des Drômes. From that hour,"
edgarallanpoe,nobody is proved to have seen her. There is no trace or tidings of her
edgarallanpoe,"at all.... There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far, who"
edgarallanpoe,"saw her at all, on that day, after she left her mother’s door.... Now,"
edgarallanpoe,though we have no evidence that Marie Rogêt was in the land of the
edgarallanpoe,"living after nine o’clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have"
edgarallanpoe,"proof that, up to that hour, she was alive. On Wednesday noon, at"
edgarallanpoe,"twelve, a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barrière"
edgarallanpoe,"de Roule. This was, even if we presume that Marie Rogêt was thrown into"
edgarallanpoe,"the river within three hours after she left her mother’s house, only"
edgarallanpoe,three days from the time she left her home--three days to an hour. But
edgarallanpoe,"it is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on"
edgarallanpoe,"her body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her"
edgarallanpoe,murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight. Those who
edgarallanpoe,"are guilty of such horrid crimes, choose darkness rather the light...."
edgarallanpoe,"Thus we see that if the body found in the river was that of Marie Rogêt,"
edgarallanpoe,"it could only have been in the water two and a half days, or three at"
edgarallanpoe,"the outside. All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies"
edgarallanpoe,"thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from"
edgarallanpoe,six to ten days for decomposition to take place to bring them to the top
edgarallanpoe,"of the water. Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises"
edgarallanpoe,"before at least five or six days’ immersion, it sinks again, if let"
edgarallanpoe,"alone. Now, we ask, what was there in this case to cause a departure"
edgarallanpoe,from the ordinary course of nature?... If the body had been kept in its
edgarallanpoe,"mangled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on"
edgarallanpoe,"shore of the murderers. It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body"
edgarallanpoe,"would be so soon afloat, even were it thrown in after having been"
edgarallanpoe,"dead two days. And, furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any"
edgarallanpoe,"villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would"
edgarallanpoe,"have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution"
edgarallanpoe,could have so easily been taken.”
edgarallanpoe,The editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the
edgarallanpoe,"water “not three days merely, but, at least, five times three days,”"
edgarallanpoe,because it was so far decomposed that Beauvais had great difficulty
edgarallanpoe,"in recognizing it. This latter point, however, was fully disproved. I"
edgarallanpoe,continue the translation:
edgarallanpoe,"“What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he has no"
edgarallanpoe,"doubt the body was that of Marie Rogêt? He ripped up the gown sleeve,"
edgarallanpoe,and says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity. The public
edgarallanpoe,generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description
edgarallanpoe,of scars. He rubbed the arm and found hair upon it--something as
edgarallanpoe,"indefinite, we think, as can readily be imagined--as little conclusive"
edgarallanpoe,"as finding an arm in the sleeve. M. Beauvais did not return that night,"
edgarallanpoe,"but sent word to Madame Rogêt, at seven o’clock, on Wednesday evening,"
edgarallanpoe,that an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter. If
edgarallanpoe,"we allow that Madame Rogêt, from her age and grief, could not go over,"
edgarallanpoe,"(which is allowing a great deal,) there certainly must have been some"
edgarallanpoe,one who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the
edgarallanpoe,"investigation, if they thought the body was that of Marie. Nobody went"
edgarallanpoe,over. There was nothing said or heard about the matter in the Rue Pavée
edgarallanpoe,"St. Andrée, that reached even the occupants of the same building. M. St."
edgarallanpoe,"Eustache, the lover and intended husband of Marie, who boarded in her"
edgarallanpoe,"mother’s house, deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the"
edgarallanpoe,"body of his intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came"
edgarallanpoe,"into his chamber and told him of it. For an item of news like this, it"
edgarallanpoe,strikes us it was very coolly received.”
edgarallanpoe,In this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy
edgarallanpoe,"on the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent with the supposition"
edgarallanpoe,that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers. Its insinuations
edgarallanpoe,"amount to this:--that Marie, with the connivance of her friends, had"
edgarallanpoe,absented herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against
edgarallanpoe,"her chastity; and that these friends, upon the discovery of a corpse in"
edgarallanpoe,"the Seine, somewhat resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves"
edgarallanpoe,of the opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her
edgarallanpoe,death. But L’Etoile was again over-hasty. It was distinctly proved
edgarallanpoe,"that no apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was"
edgarallanpoe,"exceedingly feeble, and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any"
edgarallanpoe,"duty, that St. Eustache, so far from receiving the news coolly, was"
edgarallanpoe,"distracted with grief, and bore himself so frantically, that M. Beauvais"
edgarallanpoe,"prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him, and prevent"
edgarallanpoe,"his attending the examination at the disinterment. Moreover, although"
edgarallanpoe,"it was stated by L’Etoile, that the corpse was re-interred at the public"
edgarallanpoe,expense--that an advantageous offer of private sculpture was absolutely
edgarallanpoe,declined by the family--and that no member of the family attended the
edgarallanpoe,"ceremonial:--although, I say, all this was asserted by L’Etoile in"
edgarallanpoe,furtherance of the impression it designed to convey--yet all this
edgarallanpoe,"was satisfactorily disproved. In a subsequent number of the paper, an"
edgarallanpoe,attempt was made to throw suspicion upon Beauvais himself. The editor
edgarallanpoe,says:
edgarallanpoe,"“Now, then, a change comes over the matter. We are told that on one"
edgarallanpoe,"occasion, while a Madame B---- was at Madame Rogêt’s house, M. Beauvais,"
edgarallanpoe,"who was going out, told her that a gendarme was expected there, and she,"
edgarallanpoe,"Madame B., must not say anything to the gendarme until he returned,"
edgarallanpoe,"but let the matter be for him.... In the present posture of affairs,"
edgarallanpoe,M. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter locked up in his head. A
edgarallanpoe,"single step cannot be taken without M. Beauvais; for, go which way you"
edgarallanpoe,"will, you run against him.... For some reason, he determined that nobody"
edgarallanpoe,"shall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself, and he"
edgarallanpoe,"has elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their"
edgarallanpoe,"representations, in a very singular manner. He seems to have been very"
edgarallanpoe,much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body.”
edgarallanpoe,"By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown"
edgarallanpoe,"upon Beauvais. A visiter at his office, a few days prior to the girl’s"
edgarallanpoe,"disappearance, and during the absence of its occupant, had observed a"
edgarallanpoe,"rose in the key-hole of the door, and the name “Marie” inscribed upon a"
edgarallanpoe,slate which hung near at hand.
edgarallanpoe,"The general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it from the"
edgarallanpoe,"newspapers, seemed to be, that Marie had been the victim of a gang"
edgarallanpoe,"of desperadoes--that by these she had been borne across the river,"
edgarallanpoe,"maltreated and murdered. Le Commerciel, (*11) however, a print of"
edgarallanpoe,"extensive influence, was earnest in combating this popular idea. I quote"
edgarallanpoe,a passage or two from its columns:
edgarallanpoe,"“We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent, so"
edgarallanpoe,far as it has been directed to the Barrière du Roule. It is impossible
edgarallanpoe,"that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should"
edgarallanpoe,have passed three blocks without some one having seen her; and any one
edgarallanpoe,"who saw her would have remembered it, for she interested all who knew"
edgarallanpoe,"her. It was when the streets were full of people, when she went out...."
edgarallanpoe,"It is impossible that she could have gone to the Barrière du Roule, or"
edgarallanpoe,"to the Rue des Drômes, without being recognized by a dozen persons; yet"
edgarallanpoe,"no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother’s door, and"
edgarallanpoe,"there is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her expressed"
edgarallanpoe,"intentions, that she did go out at all. Her gown was torn, bound round"
edgarallanpoe,"her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle. If the"
edgarallanpoe,"murder had been committed at the Barrière du Roule, there would have"
edgarallanpoe,been no necessity for any such arrangement. The fact that the body was
edgarallanpoe,"found floating near the Barrière, is no proof as to where it was thrown"
edgarallanpoe,"into the water..... A piece of one of the unfortunate girl’s petticoats,"
edgarallanpoe,"two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin"
edgarallanpoe,"around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done"
edgarallanpoe,by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief.”
edgarallanpoe,"A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some important"
edgarallanpoe,"information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, at least,"
edgarallanpoe,"the chief portion of Le Commerciel’s argument. Two small boys, sons of a"
edgarallanpoe,"Madame Deluc, while roaming among the woods near the Barrière du Roule,"
edgarallanpoe,"chanced to penetrate a close thicket, within which were three or four"
edgarallanpoe,"large stones, forming a kind of seat, with a back and footstool. On"
edgarallanpoe,the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf. A
edgarallanpoe,"parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found. The"
edgarallanpoe,handkerchief bore the name “Marie Rogêt.” Fragments of dress were
edgarallanpoe,"discovered on the brambles around. The earth was trampled, the bushes"
edgarallanpoe,"were broken, and there was every evidence of a struggle. Between the"
edgarallanpoe,"thicket and the river, the fences were found taken down, and the ground"
edgarallanpoe,bore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it.
edgarallanpoe,"A weekly paper, Le Soleil,(*12) had the following comments upon this"
edgarallanpoe,discovery--comments which merely echoed the sentiment of the whole
edgarallanpoe,Parisian press:
edgarallanpoe,“The things had all evidently been there at least three or four weeks;
edgarallanpoe,they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the rain and stuck
edgarallanpoe,together from mildew. The grass had grown around and over some of them.
edgarallanpoe,"The silk on the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run"
edgarallanpoe,"together within. The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded,"
edgarallanpoe,"was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on its being opened..... The"
edgarallanpoe,pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide
edgarallanpoe,"and six inches long. One part was the hem of the frock, and it had been"
edgarallanpoe,"mended; the other piece was part of the skirt, not the hem. They looked"
edgarallanpoe,"like strips torn off, and were on the thorn bush, about a foot from"
edgarallanpoe,"the ground..... There can be no doubt, therefore, that the spot of this"
edgarallanpoe,appalling outrage has been discovered.”
edgarallanpoe,"Consequent upon this discovery, new evidence appeared. Madame Deluc"
edgarallanpoe,testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of the
edgarallanpoe,"river, opposite the Barrière du Roule. The neighborhood is"
edgarallanpoe,secluded--particularly so. It is the usual Sunday resort of blackguards
edgarallanpoe,"from the city, who cross the river in boats. About three o’clock, in the"
edgarallanpoe,"afternoon of the Sunday in question, a young girl arrived at the inn,"
edgarallanpoe,accompanied by a young man of dark complexion. The two remained here for
edgarallanpoe,"some time. On their departure, they took the road to some thick woods in"
edgarallanpoe,the vicinity. Madame Deluc’s attention was called to the dress worn by
edgarallanpoe,"the girl, on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased"
edgarallanpoe,relative. A scarf was particularly noticed. Soon after the departure of
edgarallanpoe,"the couple, a gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved"
edgarallanpoe,"boisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed in the"
edgarallanpoe,"route of the young man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk, and"
edgarallanpoe,re-crossed the river as if in great haste.
edgarallanpoe,"It was soon after dark, upon this same evening, that Madame Deluc, as"
edgarallanpoe,"well as her eldest son, heard the screams of a female in the vicinity"
edgarallanpoe,of the inn. The screams were violent but brief. Madame D. recognized not
edgarallanpoe,"only the scarf which was found in the thicket, but the dress which was"
edgarallanpoe,"discovered upon the corpse. An omnibus driver, Valence, (*13) now also"
edgarallanpoe,"testified that he saw Marie Rogêt cross a ferry on the Seine, on the"
edgarallanpoe,"Sunday in question, in company with a young man of dark complexion."
edgarallanpoe,"He, Valence, knew Marie, and could not be mistaken in her identity. The"
edgarallanpoe,articles found in the thicket were fully identified by the relatives of
edgarallanpoe,Marie.
edgarallanpoe,"The items of evidence and information thus collected by myself, from"
edgarallanpoe,"the newspapers, at the suggestion of Dupin, embraced only one more"
edgarallanpoe,point--but this was a point of seemingly vast consequence. It appears
edgarallanpoe,"that, immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above described,"
edgarallanpoe,"the lifeless, or nearly lifeless body of St. Eustache, Marie’s"
edgarallanpoe,"betrothed, was found in the vicinity of what all now supposed the scene"
edgarallanpoe,"of the outrage. A phial labelled “laudanum,” and emptied, was found near"
edgarallanpoe,him. His breath gave evidence of the poison. He died without speaking.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon his person was found a letter, briefly stating his love for Marie,"
edgarallanpoe,with his design of self-destruction.
edgarallanpoe,"“I need scarcely tell you,” said Dupin, as he finished the perusal of"
edgarallanpoe,"my notes, “that this is a far more intricate case than that of the"
edgarallanpoe,Rue Morgue; from which it differs in one important respect. This is
edgarallanpoe,"an ordinary, although an atrocious instance of crime. There is nothing"
edgarallanpoe,"peculiarly outré about it. You will observe that, for this reason, the"
edgarallanpoe,"mystery has been considered easy, when, for this reason, it should have"
edgarallanpoe,"been considered difficult, of solution. Thus; at first, it was thought"
edgarallanpoe,unnecessary to offer a reward. The myrmidons of G---- were able at once
edgarallanpoe,to comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have been committed.
edgarallanpoe,They could picture to their imaginations a mode--many modes--and a
edgarallanpoe,motive--many motives; and because it was not impossible that either of
edgarallanpoe,"these numerous modes and motives could have been the actual one, they"
edgarallanpoe,have taken it for granted that one of them must. But the case with which
edgarallanpoe,"these variable fancies were entertained, and the very plausibility which"
edgarallanpoe,"each assumed, should have been understood as indicative rather of the"
edgarallanpoe,difficulties than of the facilities which must attend elucidation. I
edgarallanpoe,have before observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the
edgarallanpoe,"ordinary, that reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the"
edgarallanpoe,"true, and that the proper question in cases such as this, is not so"
edgarallanpoe,much ‘what has occurred?’ as ‘what has occurred that has never occurred
edgarallanpoe,"before?’ In the investigations at the house of Madame L’Espanaye,"
edgarallanpoe,(*14) the agents of G---- were discouraged and confounded by that
edgarallanpoe,"very unusualness which, to a properly regulated intellect, would have"
edgarallanpoe,afforded the surest omen of success; while this same intellect might
edgarallanpoe,have been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met
edgarallanpoe,"the eye in the case of the perfumery-girl, and yet told of nothing but"
edgarallanpoe,easy triumph to the functionaries of the Prefecture.
edgarallanpoe,"“In the case of Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter there was, even"
edgarallanpoe,"at the beginning of our investigation, no doubt that murder had been"
edgarallanpoe,"committed. The idea of suicide was excluded at once. Here, too, we are"
edgarallanpoe,"freed, at the commencement, from all supposition of self-murder. The"
edgarallanpoe,"body found at the Barrière du Roule, was found under such circumstances"
edgarallanpoe,as to leave us no room for embarrassment upon this important point. But
edgarallanpoe,"it has been suggested that the corpse discovered, is not that of the"
edgarallanpoe,"Marie Rogêt for the conviction of whose assassin, or assassins, the"
edgarallanpoe,"reward is offered, and respecting whom, solely, our agreement has been"
edgarallanpoe,arranged with the Prefect. We both know this gentleman well. It will not
edgarallanpoe,"do to trust him too far. If, dating our inquiries from the body found,"
edgarallanpoe,"and thence tracing a murderer, we yet discover this body to be that of"
edgarallanpoe,"some other individual than Marie; or, if starting from the living Marie,"
edgarallanpoe,"we find her, yet find her unassassinated--in either case we lose our"
edgarallanpoe,labor; since it is Monsieur G---- with whom we have to deal. For our
edgarallanpoe,"own purpose, therefore, if not for the purpose of justice, it is"
edgarallanpoe,indispensable that our first step should be the determination of the
edgarallanpoe,identity of the corpse with the Marie Rogêt who is missing.
edgarallanpoe,“With the public the arguments of L’Etoile have had weight; and that the
edgarallanpoe,journal itself is convinced of their importance would appear from
edgarallanpoe,the manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the
edgarallanpoe,"subject--‘Several of the morning papers of the day,’ it says, ‘speak of"
edgarallanpoe,"the _conclusive_ article in Monday’s Etoile.’ To me, this article"
edgarallanpoe,appears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of its inditer. We should
edgarallanpoe,"bear in mind that, in general, it is the object of our newspapers rather"
edgarallanpoe,to create a sensation--to make a point--than to further the cause of
edgarallanpoe,truth. The latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the
edgarallanpoe,former. The print which merely falls in with ordinary opinion (however
edgarallanpoe,well founded this opinion may be) earns for itself no credit with the
edgarallanpoe,mob. The mass of the people regard as profound only him who suggests
edgarallanpoe,"_pungent contradictions_ of the general idea. In ratiocination, not less"
edgarallanpoe,"than in literature, it is the epigram which is the most immediately and"
edgarallanpoe,"the most universally appreciated. In both, it is of the lowest order of"
edgarallanpoe,merit.
edgarallanpoe,"“What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epigram and melodrame"
edgarallanpoe,"of the idea, that Marie Rogêt still lives, rather than any true"
edgarallanpoe,"plausibility in this idea, which have suggested it to L’Etoile, and"
edgarallanpoe,secured it a favorable reception with the public. Let us examine the
edgarallanpoe,heads of this journal’s argument; endeavoring to avoid the incoherence
edgarallanpoe,with which it is originally set forth.
edgarallanpoe,"“The first aim of the writer is to show, from the brevity of the"
edgarallanpoe,interval between Marie’s disappearance and the finding of the floating
edgarallanpoe,"corpse, that this corpse cannot be that of Marie. The reduction of this"
edgarallanpoe,"interval to its smallest possible dimension, becomes thus, at once, an"
edgarallanpoe,"object with the reasoner. In the rash pursuit of this object, he rushes"
edgarallanpoe,"into mere assumption at the outset. ‘It is folly to suppose,’ he says,"
edgarallanpoe,"‘that the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been"
edgarallanpoe,consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body
edgarallanpoe,"into the river before midnight.’ We demand at once, and very naturally,"
edgarallanpoe,why? Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed _within
edgarallanpoe,five minutes_ after the girl’s quitting her mother’s house? Why is it
edgarallanpoe,folly to suppose that the murder was committed at any given period
edgarallanpoe,"of the day? There have been assassinations at all hours. But, had the"
edgarallanpoe,murder taken place at any moment between nine o’clock in the morning of
edgarallanpoe,"Sunday, and a quarter before midnight, there would still have been"
edgarallanpoe,time enough ‘to throw the body into the river before midnight.’ This
edgarallanpoe,"assumption, then, amounts precisely to this--that the murder was not"
edgarallanpoe,"committed on Sunday at all--and, if we allow L’Etoile to assume this,"
edgarallanpoe,we may permit it any liberties whatever. The paragraph beginning ‘It is
edgarallanpoe,"folly to suppose that the murder, etc.,’ however it appears as printed"
edgarallanpoe,"in L’Etoile, may be imagined to have existed actually thus in the brain"
edgarallanpoe,"of its inditer--‘It is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was"
edgarallanpoe,"committed on the body, could have been committed soon enough to have"
edgarallanpoe,enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight;
edgarallanpoe,"it is folly, we say, to suppose all this, and to suppose at the same"
edgarallanpoe,"time, (as we are resolved to suppose,) that the body was not thrown"
edgarallanpoe,in until after midnight’--a sentence sufficiently inconsequential in
edgarallanpoe,"itself, but not so utterly preposterous as the one printed."
edgarallanpoe,"“Were it my purpose,” continued Dupin, “merely to _make out a case_"
edgarallanpoe,"against this passage of L’Etoile’s argument, I might safely leave it"
edgarallanpoe,"where it is. It is not, however, with L’Etoile that we have to do, but"
edgarallanpoe,"with the truth. The sentence in question has but one meaning, as it"
edgarallanpoe,stands; and this meaning I have fairly stated: but it is material
edgarallanpoe,"that we go behind the mere words, for an idea which these words have"
edgarallanpoe,"obviously intended, and failed to convey. It was the design of the"
edgarallanpoe,"journalist to say that, at whatever period of the day or night of Sunday"
edgarallanpoe,"this murder was committed, it was improbable that the assassins would"
edgarallanpoe,have ventured to bear the corpse to the river before midnight. And
edgarallanpoe,"herein lies, really, the assumption of which I complain. It is assumed"
edgarallanpoe,"that the murder was committed at such a position, and under such"
edgarallanpoe,"circumstances, that the bearing it to the river became necessary. Now,"
edgarallanpoe,"the assassination might have taken place upon the river’s brink, or on"
edgarallanpoe,"the river itself; and, thus, the throwing the corpse in the water might"
edgarallanpoe,"have been resorted to, at any period of the day or night, as the most"
edgarallanpoe,obvious and most immediate mode of disposal. You will understand that I
edgarallanpoe,"suggest nothing here as probable, or as cöincident with my own opinion."
edgarallanpoe,"My design, so far, has no reference to the facts of the case. I wish"
edgarallanpoe,"merely to caution you against the whole tone of L’Etoile’s suggestion,"
edgarallanpoe,by calling your attention to its ex parte character at the outset.
edgarallanpoe,“Having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived notions;
edgarallanpoe,"having assumed that, if this were the body of Marie, it could have been"
edgarallanpoe,in the water but a very brief time; the journal goes on to say:
edgarallanpoe,"‘All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the"
edgarallanpoe,"water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days"
edgarallanpoe,for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top
edgarallanpoe,"of the water. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises"
edgarallanpoe,"before at least five or six days’ immersion, it sinks again if let"
edgarallanpoe,alone.’
edgarallanpoe,"“These assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in Paris,"
edgarallanpoe,with the exception of Le Moniteur. (*15) This latter print endeavors
edgarallanpoe,to combat that portion of the paragraph which has reference to ‘drowned
edgarallanpoe,"bodies’ only, by citing some five or six instances in which the bodies"
edgarallanpoe,of individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse
edgarallanpoe,of less time than is insisted upon by L’Etoile. But there is something
edgarallanpoe,"excessively unphilosophical in the attempt on the part of Le Moniteur,"
edgarallanpoe,"to rebut the general assertion of L’Etoile, by a citation of particular"
edgarallanpoe,instances militating against that assertion. Had it been possible to
edgarallanpoe,adduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies found floating at the
edgarallanpoe,"end of two or three days, these fifty examples could still have been"
edgarallanpoe,"properly regarded only as exceptions to L’Etoile’s rule, until such time"
edgarallanpoe,"as the rule itself should be confuted. Admitting the rule, (and this"
edgarallanpoe,"Le Moniteur does not deny, insisting merely upon its exceptions,) the"
edgarallanpoe,argument of L’Etoile is suffered to remain in full force; for this
edgarallanpoe,argument does not pretend to involve more than a question of the
edgarallanpoe,probability of the body having risen to the surface in less than three
edgarallanpoe,days; and this probability will be in favor of L’Etoile’s position until
edgarallanpoe,the instances so childishly adduced shall be sufficient in number to
edgarallanpoe,establish an antagonistical rule.
edgarallanpoe,"“You will see at once that all argument upon this head should be urged,"
edgarallanpoe,"if at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we must examine the"
edgarallanpoe,"rationale of the rule. Now the human body, in general, is neither much"
edgarallanpoe,"lighter nor much heavier than the water of the Seine; that is to say,"
edgarallanpoe,"the specific gravity of the human body, in its natural condition, is"
edgarallanpoe,about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displaces. The bodies
edgarallanpoe,"of fat and fleshy persons, with small bones, and of women generally,"
edgarallanpoe,"are lighter than those of the lean and large-boned, and of men; and the"
edgarallanpoe,specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the
edgarallanpoe,"presence of the tide from sea. But, leaving this tide out of question,"
edgarallanpoe,"it may be said that very few human bodies will sink at all, even in"
edgarallanpoe,"fresh water, of their own accord. Almost any one, falling into a river,"
edgarallanpoe,"will be enabled to float, if he suffer the specific gravity of the water"
edgarallanpoe,"fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own--that is to say, if"
edgarallanpoe,"he suffer his whole person to be immersed, with as little exception as"
edgarallanpoe,"possible. The proper position for one who cannot swim, is the upright"
edgarallanpoe,"position of the walker on land, with the head thrown fully back, and"
edgarallanpoe,immersed; the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface.
edgarallanpoe,"Thus circumstanced, we shall find that we float without difficulty and"
edgarallanpoe,"without exertion. It is evident, however, that the gravities of the"
edgarallanpoe,"body, and of the bulk of water displaced, are very nicely balanced, and"
edgarallanpoe,"that a trifle will cause either to preponderate. An arm, for instance,"
edgarallanpoe,"uplifted from the water, and thus deprived of its support, is an"
edgarallanpoe,"additional weight sufficient to immerse the whole head, while the"
edgarallanpoe,accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber will enable us to elevate
edgarallanpoe,"the head so as to look about. Now, in the struggles of one unused to"
edgarallanpoe,"swimming, the arms are invariably thrown upwards, while an attempt is"
edgarallanpoe,made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position. The result
edgarallanpoe,"is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception, during"
edgarallanpoe,"efforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the lungs."
edgarallanpoe,"Much is also received into the stomach, and the whole body becomes"
edgarallanpoe,heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally
edgarallanpoe,"distending these cavities, and that of the fluid which now fills them."
edgarallanpoe,"This difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink, as a general"
edgarallanpoe,rule; but is insufficient in the cases of individuals with small bones
edgarallanpoe,and an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter. Such individuals
edgarallanpoe,float even after drowning.
edgarallanpoe,"“The corpse, being supposed at the bottom of the river, will there"
edgarallanpoe,"remain until, by some means, its specific gravity again becomes less"
edgarallanpoe,than that of the bulk of water which it displaces. This effect
edgarallanpoe,"is brought about by decomposition, or otherwise. The result of"
edgarallanpoe,"decomposition is the generation of gas, distending the cellular tissues"
edgarallanpoe,"and all the cavities, and giving the puffed appearance which is so"
edgarallanpoe,horrible. When this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of
edgarallanpoe,the corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of
edgarallanpoe,"mass or weight, its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water"
edgarallanpoe,"displaced, and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface. But"
edgarallanpoe,decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances--is hastened or
edgarallanpoe,"retarded by innumerable agencies; for example, by the heat or cold of"
edgarallanpoe,"the season, by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water, by its"
edgarallanpoe,"depth or shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, by the temperament"
edgarallanpoe,"of the body, by its infection or freedom from disease before death."
edgarallanpoe,"Thus it is evident that we can assign no period, with any thing like"
edgarallanpoe,"accuracy, at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition. Under"
edgarallanpoe,certain conditions this result would be brought about within an hour;
edgarallanpoe,"under others, it might not take place at all. There are chemical"
edgarallanpoe,infusions by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from
edgarallanpoe,"corruption; the Bi-chloride of Mercury is one. But, apart from"
edgarallanpoe,"decomposition, there may be, and very usually is, a generation of gas"
edgarallanpoe,"within the stomach, from the acetous fermentation of vegetable matter"
edgarallanpoe,(or within other cavities from other causes) sufficient to induce a
edgarallanpoe,distension which will bring the body to the surface. The effect produced
edgarallanpoe,by the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration. This may either
edgarallanpoe,"loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded,"
edgarallanpoe,thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared
edgarallanpoe,it for so doing; or it may overcome the tenacity of some putrescent
edgarallanpoe,portions of the cellular tissue; allowing the cavities to distend under
edgarallanpoe,the influence of the gas.
edgarallanpoe,"“Having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject, we can"
edgarallanpoe,"easily test by it the assertions of L’Etoile. ‘All experience shows,’"
edgarallanpoe,"says this paper, ‘that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water"
edgarallanpoe,"immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for"
edgarallanpoe,sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the
edgarallanpoe,"water. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at"
edgarallanpoe,"least five or six days’ immersion, it sinks again if let alone.’"
edgarallanpoe,“The whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of inconsequence
edgarallanpoe,and incoherence. All experience does not show that ‘drowned bodies’
edgarallanpoe,require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place
edgarallanpoe,to bring them to the surface. Both science and experience show that the
edgarallanpoe,"period of their rising is, and necessarily must be, indeterminate. If,"
edgarallanpoe,"moreover, a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon,"
edgarallanpoe,"it will not ‘sink again if let alone,’ until decomposition has so far"
edgarallanpoe,progressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas. But I wish to
edgarallanpoe,call your attention to the distinction which is made between ‘drowned
edgarallanpoe,"bodies,’ and ‘bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by"
edgarallanpoe,"violence.’ Although the writer admits the distinction, he yet includes"
edgarallanpoe,them all in the same category. I have shown how it is that the body of
edgarallanpoe,"a drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water,"
edgarallanpoe,"and that he would not sink at all, except for the struggles by which"
edgarallanpoe,"he elevates his arms above the surface, and his gasps for breath while"
edgarallanpoe,beneath the surface--gasps which supply by water the place of the
edgarallanpoe,original air in the lungs. But these struggles and these gasps would
edgarallanpoe,not occur in the body ‘thrown into the water immediately after death by
edgarallanpoe,"violence.’ Thus, in the latter instance, the body, as a general rule,"
edgarallanpoe,would not sink at all--a fact of which L’Etoile is evidently ignorant.
edgarallanpoe,When decomposition had proceeded to a very great extent--when the flesh
edgarallanpoe,"had in a great measure left the bones--then, indeed, but not till then,"
edgarallanpoe,should we lose sight of the corpse.
edgarallanpoe,"“And now what are we to make of the argument, that the body found could"
edgarallanpoe,"not be that of Marie Rogêt, because, three days only having elapsed,"
edgarallanpoe,"this body was found floating? If drowned, being a woman, she might never"
edgarallanpoe,"have sunk; or having sunk, might have reappeared in twenty-four hours,"
edgarallanpoe,"or less. But no one supposes her to have been drowned; and, dying before"
edgarallanpoe,"being thrown into the river, she might have been found floating at any"
edgarallanpoe,period afterwards whatever.
edgarallanpoe,"“‘But,’ says L’Etoile, ‘if the body had been kept in its mangled state"
edgarallanpoe,"on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the"
edgarallanpoe,murderers.’ Here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention
edgarallanpoe,of the reasoner. He means to anticipate what he imagines would be an
edgarallanpoe,"objection to his theory--viz: that the body was kept on shore two days,"
edgarallanpoe,suffering rapid decomposition--more rapid than if immersed in water. He
edgarallanpoe,"supposes that, had this been the case, it might have appeared at the"
edgarallanpoe,"surface on the Wednesday, and thinks that only under such circumstances"
edgarallanpoe,it could so have appeared. He is accordingly in haste to show that it
edgarallanpoe,"was not kept on shore; for, if so, ‘some trace would be found on shore"
edgarallanpoe,of the murderers.’ I presume you smile at the sequitur. You cannot
edgarallanpoe,be made to see how the mere duration of the corpse on the shore could
edgarallanpoe,operate to multiply traces of the assassins. Nor can I.
edgarallanpoe,"“‘And furthermore it is exceedingly improbable,’ continues our journal,"
edgarallanpoe,"‘that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed,"
edgarallanpoe,"would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such"
edgarallanpoe,"a precaution could have so easily been taken.’ Observe, here, the"
edgarallanpoe,laughable confusion of thought! No one--not even L’Etoile--disputes
edgarallanpoe,the murder committed _on the body found_. The marks of violence are too
edgarallanpoe,obvious. It is our reasoner’s object merely to show that this body is
edgarallanpoe,not Marie’s. He wishes to prove that Marie is not assassinated--not that
edgarallanpoe,the corpse was not. Yet his observation proves only the latter point.
edgarallanpoe,"Here is a corpse without weight attached. Murderers, casting it in,"
edgarallanpoe,would not have failed to attach a weight. Therefore it was not thrown in
edgarallanpoe,"by murderers. This is all which is proved, if any thing is. The question"
edgarallanpoe,"of identity is not even approached, and L’Etoile has been at great pains"
edgarallanpoe,merely to gainsay now what it has admitted only a moment before. ‘We
edgarallanpoe,"are perfectly convinced,’ it says, ‘that the body found was that of a"
edgarallanpoe,murdered female.’
edgarallanpoe,"“Nor is this the sole instance, even in this division of his subject,"
edgarallanpoe,where our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself. His evident
edgarallanpoe,"object, I have already said, is to reduce, as much as possible, the"
edgarallanpoe,interval between Marie’s disappearance and the finding of the corpse.
edgarallanpoe,Yet we find him urging the point that no person saw the girl from the
edgarallanpoe,"moment of her leaving her mother’s house. ‘We have no evidence,’ he"
edgarallanpoe,"says, ‘that Marie Rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o’clock"
edgarallanpoe,"on Sunday, June the twenty-second.’ As his argument is obviously an ex"
edgarallanpoe,"parte one, he should, at least, have left this matter out of sight; for"
edgarallanpoe,"had any one been known to see Marie, say on Monday, or on Tuesday,"
edgarallanpoe,"the interval in question would have been much reduced, and, by his own"
edgarallanpoe,"ratiocination, the probability much diminished of the corpse being that"
edgarallanpoe,"of the grisette. It is, nevertheless, amusing to observe that L’Etoile"
edgarallanpoe,insists upon its point in the full belief of its furthering its general
edgarallanpoe,argument.
edgarallanpoe,“Reperuse now that portion of this argument which has reference to the
edgarallanpoe,identification of the corpse by Beauvais. In regard to the hair upon the
edgarallanpoe,"arm, L’Etoile has been obviously disingenuous. M. Beauvais, not being an"
edgarallanpoe,"idiot, could never have urged, in identification of the corpse, simply"
edgarallanpoe,hair upon its arm. No arm is without hair. The generality of the
edgarallanpoe,expression of L’Etoile is a mere perversion of the witness’ phraseology.
edgarallanpoe,He must have spoken of some peculiarity in this hair. It must have been
edgarallanpoe,"a peculiarity of color, of quantity, of length, or of situation."
edgarallanpoe,"“‘Her foot,’ says the journal, ‘was small--so are thousands of feet. Her"
edgarallanpoe,garter is no proof whatever--nor is her shoe--for shoes and garters are
edgarallanpoe,sold in packages. The same may be said of the flowers in her hat. One
edgarallanpoe,"thing upon which M. Beauvais strongly insists is, that the clasp on the"
edgarallanpoe,"garter found, had been set back to take it in. This amounts to nothing;"
edgarallanpoe,for most women find it proper to take a pair of garters home and fit
edgarallanpoe,"them to the size of the limbs they are to encircle, rather than to try"
edgarallanpoe,them in the store where they purchase.’ Here it is difficult to suppose
edgarallanpoe,"the reasoner in earnest. Had M. Beauvais, in his search for the body of"
edgarallanpoe,"Marie, discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance"
edgarallanpoe,"to the missing girl, he would have been warranted (without reference to"
edgarallanpoe,the question of habiliment at all) in forming an opinion that his search
edgarallanpoe,"had been successful. If, in addition to the point of general size and"
edgarallanpoe,"contour, he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he"
edgarallanpoe,"had observed upon the living Marie, his opinion might have been justly"
edgarallanpoe,strengthened; and the increase of positiveness might well have been in
edgarallanpoe,"the ratio of the peculiarity, or unusualness, of the hairy mark. If,"
edgarallanpoe,"the feet of Marie being small, those of the corpse were also small, the"
edgarallanpoe,increase of probability that the body was that of Marie would not be an
edgarallanpoe,"increase in a ratio merely arithmetical, but in one highly geometrical,"
edgarallanpoe,or accumulative. Add to all this shoes such as she had been known to
edgarallanpoe,"wear upon the day of her disappearance, and, although these shoes may be"
edgarallanpoe,"‘sold in packages,’ you so far augment the probability as to verge upon"
edgarallanpoe,"the certain. What, of itself, would be no evidence of identity, becomes"
edgarallanpoe,"through its corroborative position, proof most sure. Give us, then,"
edgarallanpoe,"flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl, and"
edgarallanpoe,"we seek for nothing farther. If only one flower, we seek for nothing"
edgarallanpoe,"farther--what then if two or three, or more? Each successive one"
edgarallanpoe,"is multiple evidence--proof not _added_ to proof, but multiplied by"
edgarallanpoe,"hundreds or thousands. Let us now discover, upon the deceased, garters"
edgarallanpoe,"such as the living used, and it is almost folly to proceed. But these"
edgarallanpoe,"garters are found to be tightened, by the setting back of a clasp,"
edgarallanpoe,"in just such a manner as her own had been tightened by Marie, shortly"
edgarallanpoe,previous to her leaving home. It is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt.
edgarallanpoe,What L’Etoile says in respect to this abbreviation of the garter’s being
edgarallanpoe,"an usual occurrence, shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in error."
edgarallanpoe,The elastic nature of the clasp-garter is self-demonstration of the
edgarallanpoe,"unusualness of the abbreviation. What is made to adjust itself, must of"
edgarallanpoe,necessity require foreign adjustment but rarely. It must have been by an
edgarallanpoe,"accident, in its strictest sense, that these garters of Marie needed"
edgarallanpoe,the tightening described. They alone would have amply established her
edgarallanpoe,identity. But it is not that the corpse was found to have the garters
edgarallanpoe,"of the missing girl, or found to have her shoes, or her bonnet, or the"
edgarallanpoe,"flowers of her bonnet, or her feet, or a peculiar mark upon the arm,"
edgarallanpoe,"or her general size and appearance--it is that the corpse had each,"
edgarallanpoe,and _all collectively_. Could it be proved that the editor of L’Etoile
edgarallanpoe,"_really_ entertained a doubt, under the circumstances, there would be"
edgarallanpoe,"no need, in his case, of a commission de lunatico inquirendo. He has"
edgarallanpoe,"thought it sagacious to echo the small talk of the lawyers, who, for the"
edgarallanpoe,"most part, content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of"
edgarallanpoe,the courts. I would here observe that very much of what is rejected as
edgarallanpoe,"evidence by a court, is the best of evidence to the intellect. For"
edgarallanpoe,"the court, guiding itself by the general principles of evidence--the"
edgarallanpoe,recognized and _booked_ principles--is averse from swerving at
edgarallanpoe,"particular instances. And this steadfast adherence to principle, with"
edgarallanpoe,"rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception, is a sure mode of"
edgarallanpoe,"attaining the maximum of attainable truth, in any long sequence of time."
edgarallanpoe,"The practice, in mass, is therefore philosophical; but it is not the"
edgarallanpoe,less certain that it engenders vast individual error. (*16)
edgarallanpoe,"“In respect to the insinuations levelled at Beauvais, you will be"
edgarallanpoe,willing to dismiss them in a breath. You have already fathomed the
edgarallanpoe,"true character of this good gentleman. He is a busy-body, with much"
edgarallanpoe,of romance and little of wit. Any one so constituted will readily so
edgarallanpoe,"conduct himself, upon occasion of real excitement, as to render himself"
edgarallanpoe,"liable to suspicion on the part of the over acute, or the ill-disposed."
edgarallanpoe,M. Beauvais (as it appears from your notes) had some personal interviews
edgarallanpoe,"with the editor of L’Etoile, and offended him by venturing an opinion"
edgarallanpoe,"that the corpse, notwithstanding the theory of the editor, was, in sober"
edgarallanpoe,"fact, that of Marie. ‘He persists,’ says the paper, ‘in asserting the"
edgarallanpoe,"corpse to be that of Marie, but cannot give a circumstance, in addition"
edgarallanpoe,"to those which we have commented upon, to make others believe.’ Now,"
edgarallanpoe,without re-adverting to the fact that stronger evidence ‘to make others
edgarallanpoe,"believe,’ could never have been adduced, it may be remarked that a man"
edgarallanpoe,"may very well be understood to believe, in a case of this kind, without"
edgarallanpoe,the ability to advance a single reason for the belief of a second party.
edgarallanpoe,Nothing is more vague than impressions of individual identity. Each man
edgarallanpoe,"recognizes his neighbor, yet there are few instances in which any one"
edgarallanpoe,is prepared to give a reason for his recognition. The editor of L’Etoile
edgarallanpoe,had no right to be offended at M. Beauvais’ unreasoning belief.
edgarallanpoe,"“The suspicious circumstances which invest him, will be found to tally"
edgarallanpoe,"much better with my hypothesis of romantic busy-bodyism, than with"
edgarallanpoe,the reasoner’s suggestion of guilt. Once adopting the more charitable
edgarallanpoe,"interpretation, we shall find no difficulty in comprehending the rose"
edgarallanpoe,in the key-hole; the ‘Marie’ upon the slate; the ‘elbowing the male
edgarallanpoe,relatives out of the way;’ the ‘aversion to permitting them to see
edgarallanpoe,"the body;’ the caution given to Madame B----, that she must hold no"
edgarallanpoe,"conversation with the gendarme until his return (Beauvais’); and,"
edgarallanpoe,"lastly, his apparent determination ‘that nobody should have anything to"
edgarallanpoe,do with the proceedings except himself.’ It seems to me unquestionable
edgarallanpoe,that Beauvais was a suitor of Marie’s; that she coquetted with him; and
edgarallanpoe,that he was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy
edgarallanpoe,"and confidence. I shall say nothing more upon this point; and, as the"
edgarallanpoe,"evidence fully rebuts the assertion of L’Etoile, touching the matter"
edgarallanpoe,of apathy on the part of the mother and other relatives--an apathy
edgarallanpoe,inconsistent with the supposition of their believing the corpse to be
edgarallanpoe,that of the perfumery-girl--we shall now proceed as if the question of
edgarallanpoe,identity were settled to our perfect satisfaction.”
edgarallanpoe,"“And what,” I here demanded, “do you think of the opinions of Le"
edgarallanpoe,Commerciel?”
edgarallanpoe,"“That, in spirit, they are far more worthy of attention than any which"
edgarallanpoe,have been promulgated upon the subject. The deductions from the premises
edgarallanpoe,"are philosophical and acute; but the premises, in two instances, at"
edgarallanpoe,"least, are founded in imperfect observation. Le Commerciel wishes to"
edgarallanpoe,intimate that Marie was seized by some gang of low ruffians not far from
edgarallanpoe,"her mother’s door. ‘It is impossible,’ it urges, ‘that a person so well"
edgarallanpoe,"known to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three"
edgarallanpoe,blocks without some one having seen her.’ This is the idea of a man long
edgarallanpoe,resident in Paris--a public man--and one whose walks to and fro in the
edgarallanpoe,"city, have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices."
edgarallanpoe,He is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own
edgarallanpoe,"bureau, without being recognized and accosted. And, knowing the extent"
edgarallanpoe,"of his personal acquaintance with others, and of others with him, he"
edgarallanpoe,"compares his notoriety with that of the perfumery-girl, finds no great"
edgarallanpoe,"difference between them, and reaches at once the conclusion that she, in"
edgarallanpoe,"her walks, would be equally liable to recognition with himself in"
edgarallanpoe,"his. This could only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying,"
edgarallanpoe,"methodical character, and within the same species of limited region"
edgarallanpoe,"as are his own. He passes to and fro, at regular intervals, within a"
edgarallanpoe,"confined periphery, abounding in individuals who are led to observation"
edgarallanpoe,of his person through interest in the kindred nature of his occupation
edgarallanpoe,"with their own. But the walks of Marie may, in general, be supposed"
edgarallanpoe,"discursive. In this particular instance, it will be understood as most"
edgarallanpoe,"probable, that she proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity"
edgarallanpoe,from her accustomed ones. The parallel which we imagine to have existed
edgarallanpoe,in the mind of Le Commerciel would only be sustained in the event of the
edgarallanpoe,"two individuals’ traversing the whole city. In this case, granting the"
edgarallanpoe,"personal acquaintances to be equal, the chances would be also equal that"
edgarallanpoe,an equal number of personal rencounters would be made. For my own
edgarallanpoe,"part, I should hold it not only as possible, but as very far more than"
edgarallanpoe,"probable, that Marie might have proceeded, at any given period, by any"
edgarallanpoe,"one of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt,"
edgarallanpoe,"without meeting a single individual whom she knew, or by whom she was"
edgarallanpoe,"known. In viewing this question in its full and proper light, we must"
edgarallanpoe,hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal
edgarallanpoe,"acquaintances of even the most noted individual in Paris, and the entire"
edgarallanpoe,population of Paris itself.
edgarallanpoe,“But whatever force there may still appear to be in the suggestion of Le
edgarallanpoe,"Commerciel, will be much diminished when we take into consideration the"
edgarallanpoe,hour at which the girl went abroad. ‘It was when the streets were full
edgarallanpoe,"of people,’ says Le Commerciel, ‘that she went out.’ But not so. It was"
edgarallanpoe,at nine o’clock in the morning. Now at nine o’clock of every morning in
edgarallanpoe,"the week, _with the exception of Sunday_, the streets of the city are,"
edgarallanpoe,"it is true, thronged with people. At nine on Sunday, the populace are"
edgarallanpoe,chiefly within doors _preparing for church_. No observing person can
edgarallanpoe,"have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town, from"
edgarallanpoe,about eight until ten on the morning of every Sabbath. Between ten and
edgarallanpoe,"eleven the streets are thronged, but not at so early a period as that"
edgarallanpoe,designated.
edgarallanpoe,“There is another point at which there seems a deficiency of observation
edgarallanpoe,"on the part of Le Commerciel. ‘A piece,’ it says, ‘of one of the"
edgarallanpoe,"unfortunate girl’s petticoats, two feet long, and one foot wide, was"
edgarallanpoe,"torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head,"
edgarallanpoe,"probably to prevent screams. This was done, by fellows who had no"
edgarallanpoe,"pocket-handkerchiefs.’ Whether this idea is, or is not well founded,"
edgarallanpoe,we will endeavor to see hereafter; but by ‘fellows who have no
edgarallanpoe,pocket-handkerchiefs’ the editor intends the lowest class of ruffians.
edgarallanpoe,"These, however, are the very description of people who will always be"
edgarallanpoe,found to have handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts. You must have
edgarallanpoe,"had occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable, of late years, to"
edgarallanpoe,"the thorough blackguard, has become the pocket-handkerchief.”"
edgarallanpoe,"“And what are we to think,” I asked, “of the article in Le Soleil?”"
edgarallanpoe,“That it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrot--in which
edgarallanpoe,case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his race. He has
edgarallanpoe,merely repeated the individual items of the already published opinion;
edgarallanpoe,"collecting them, with a laudable industry, from this paper and from"
edgarallanpoe,"that. ‘The things had all evidently been there,’ he says, ‘at least,"
edgarallanpoe,"three or four weeks, and there can be _no doubt_ that the spot of this"
edgarallanpoe,appalling outrage has been discovered.’ The facts here re-stated by
edgarallanpoe,"Le Soleil, are very far indeed from removing my own doubts upon this"
edgarallanpoe,"subject, and we will examine them more particularly hereafter in"
edgarallanpoe,connexion with another division of the theme.
edgarallanpoe,“At present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations. You
edgarallanpoe,cannot fail to have remarked the extreme laxity of the examination of
edgarallanpoe,"the corpse. To be sure, the question of identity was readily determined,"
edgarallanpoe,or should have been; but there were other points to be ascertained. Had
edgarallanpoe,the body been in any respect despoiled? Had the deceased any articles
edgarallanpoe,"of jewelry about her person upon leaving home? if so, had she any when"
edgarallanpoe,found? These are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence;
edgarallanpoe,"and there are others of equal moment, which have met with no attention."
edgarallanpoe,We must endeavor to satisfy ourselves by personal inquiry. The case of
edgarallanpoe,St. Eustache must be re-examined. I have no suspicion of this person;
edgarallanpoe,but let us proceed methodically. We will ascertain beyond a doubt the
edgarallanpoe,validity of the affidavits in regard to his whereabouts on the Sunday.
edgarallanpoe,Affidavits of this character are readily made matter of mystification.
edgarallanpoe,"Should there be nothing wrong here, however, we will dismiss St."
edgarallanpoe,"Eustache from our investigations. His suicide, however corroborative of"
edgarallanpoe,"suspicion, were there found to be deceit in the affidavits, is, without"
edgarallanpoe,"such deceit, in no respect an unaccountable circumstance, or one which"
edgarallanpoe,need cause us to deflect from the line of ordinary analysis.
edgarallanpoe,"“In that which I now propose, we will discard the interior points of"
edgarallanpoe,"this tragedy, and concentrate our attention upon its outskirts. Not the"
edgarallanpoe,"least usual error, in investigations such as this, is the limiting of"
edgarallanpoe,"inquiry to the immediate, with total disregard of the collateral or"
edgarallanpoe,circumstantial events. It is the mal-practice of the courts to confine
edgarallanpoe,evidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy. Yet
edgarallanpoe,"experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a"
edgarallanpoe,"vast, perhaps the larger portion of truth, arises from the seemingly"
edgarallanpoe,"irrelevant. It is through the spirit of this principle, if not precisely"
edgarallanpoe,"through its letter, that modern science has resolved to calculate upon"
edgarallanpoe,the unforeseen. But perhaps you do not comprehend me. The history of
edgarallanpoe,"human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or"
edgarallanpoe,"incidental, or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous"
edgarallanpoe,"and most valuable discoveries, that it has at length become necessary,"
edgarallanpoe,"in any prospective view of improvement, to make not only large, but the"
edgarallanpoe,"largest allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite"
edgarallanpoe,out of the range of ordinary expectation. It is no longer philosophical
edgarallanpoe,"to base, upon what has been, a vision of what is to be. Accident is"
edgarallanpoe,admitted as a portion of the substructure. We make chance a matter of
edgarallanpoe,"absolute calculation. We subject the unlooked for and unimagined, to the"
edgarallanpoe,mathematical _formulae_ of the schools.
edgarallanpoe,"“I repeat that it is no more than fact, that the larger portion of all"
edgarallanpoe,truth has sprung from the collateral; and it is but in accordance with
edgarallanpoe,"the spirit of the principle involved in this fact, that I would divert"
edgarallanpoe,"inquiry, in the present case, from the trodden and hitherto unfruitful"
edgarallanpoe,"ground of the event itself, to the contemporary circumstances which"
edgarallanpoe,"surround it. While you ascertain the validity of the affidavits, I will"
edgarallanpoe,"examine the newspapers more generally than you have as yet done. So far,"
edgarallanpoe,we have only reconnoitred the field of investigation; but it will be
edgarallanpoe,"strange indeed if a comprehensive survey, such as I propose, of the"
edgarallanpoe,"public prints, will not afford us some minute points which shall"
edgarallanpoe,establish a direction for inquiry.”
edgarallanpoe,"In pursuance of Dupin’s suggestion, I made scrupulous examination of"
edgarallanpoe,the affair of the affidavits. The result was a firm conviction of their
edgarallanpoe,"validity, and of the consequent innocence of St. Eustache. In the mean"
edgarallanpoe,"time my friend occupied himself, with what seemed to me a minuteness"
edgarallanpoe,"altogether objectless, in a scrutiny of the various newspaper files. At"
edgarallanpoe,the end of a week he placed before me the following extracts:
edgarallanpoe,"“About three years and a half ago, a disturbance very similar to the"
edgarallanpoe,"present, was caused by the disappearance of this same Marie Rogêt, from"
edgarallanpoe,"the parfumerie of Monsieur Le Blanc, in the Palais Royal. At the end of"
edgarallanpoe,"a week, however, she re-appeared at her customary comptoir, as well as"
edgarallanpoe,"ever, with the exception of a slight paleness not altogether usual. It"
edgarallanpoe,"was given out by Monsieur Le Blanc and her mother, that she had merely"
edgarallanpoe,been on a visit to some friend in the country; and the affair was
edgarallanpoe,speedily hushed up. We presume that the present absence is a freak of
edgarallanpoe,"the same nature, and that, at the expiration of a week, or perhaps of"
edgarallanpoe,"a month, we shall have her among us again.”--Evening Paper--Monday June"
edgarallanpoe,23. (*17)
edgarallanpoe,"“An evening journal of yesterday, refers to a former mysterious"
edgarallanpoe,"disappearance of Mademoiselle Rogêt. It is well known that, during the"
edgarallanpoe,"week of her absence from Le Blanc’s parfumerie, she was in the company"
edgarallanpoe,"of a young naval officer, much noted for his debaucheries. A quarrel, it"
edgarallanpoe,"is supposed, providentially led to her return home. We have the name of"
edgarallanpoe,"the Lothario in question, who is, at present, stationed in Paris, but,"
edgarallanpoe,"for obvious reasons, forbear to make it public.”--Le Mercurie--Tuesday"
edgarallanpoe,"Morning, June 24. (*18)"
edgarallanpoe,“An outrage of the most atrocious character was perpetrated near this
edgarallanpoe,"city the day before yesterday. A gentleman, with his wife and daughter,"
edgarallanpoe,"engaged, about dusk, the services of six young men, who were idly rowing"
edgarallanpoe,"a boat to and fro near the banks of the Seine, to convey him across the"
edgarallanpoe,"river. Upon reaching the opposite shore, the three passengers stepped"
edgarallanpoe,"out, and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat,"
edgarallanpoe,when the daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol. She
edgarallanpoe,"returned for it, was seized by the gang, carried out into the stream,"
edgarallanpoe,"gagged, brutally treated, and finally taken to the shore at a point"
edgarallanpoe,not far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with her
edgarallanpoe,"parents. The villains have escaped for the time, but the police are upon"
edgarallanpoe,"their trail, and some of them will soon be taken.”--Morning Paper--June"
edgarallanpoe,25. (*19)
edgarallanpoe,"“We have received one or two communications, the object of which is to"
edgarallanpoe,fasten the crime of the late atrocity upon Mennais; (*20) but as this
edgarallanpoe,"gentleman has been fully exonerated by a loyal inquiry, and as the"
edgarallanpoe,arguments of our several correspondents appear to be more zealous than
edgarallanpoe,"profound, we do not think it advisable to make them public.”--Morning"
edgarallanpoe,Paper--June 28. (*21)
edgarallanpoe,"“We have received several forcibly written communications, apparently"
edgarallanpoe,"from various sources, and which go far to render it a matter of"
edgarallanpoe,certainty that the unfortunate Marie Rogêt has become a victim of one of
edgarallanpoe,the numerous bands of blackguards which infest the vicinity of the city
edgarallanpoe,upon Sunday. Our own opinion is decidedly in favor of this
edgarallanpoe,supposition. We shall endeavor to make room for some of these arguments
edgarallanpoe,"hereafter.”--Evening Paper--Tuesday, June 31. (*22)"
edgarallanpoe,"“On Monday, one of the bargemen connected with the revenue service, saw"
edgarallanpoe,a empty boat floating down the Seine. Sails were lying in the bottom of
edgarallanpoe,the boat. The bargeman towed it under the barge office. The next morning
edgarallanpoe,"it was taken from thence, without the knowledge of any of the officers."
edgarallanpoe,"The rudder is now at the barge office.”--Le Diligence--Thursday, June"
edgarallanpoe,26.
edgarallanpoe,"Upon reading these various extracts, they not only seemed to me"
edgarallanpoe,"irrelevant, but I could perceive no mode in which any one of them"
edgarallanpoe,could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand. I waited for some
edgarallanpoe,explanation from Dupin.
edgarallanpoe,"“It is not my present design,” he said, “to dwell upon the first and"
edgarallanpoe,second of those extracts. I have copied them chiefly to show you the
edgarallanpoe,"extreme remissness of the police, who, as far as I can understand from"
edgarallanpoe,"the Prefect, have not troubled themselves, in any respect, with an"
edgarallanpoe,examination of the naval officer alluded to. Yet it is mere folly to say
edgarallanpoe,"that between the first and second disappearance of Marie, there is"
edgarallanpoe,no _supposable_ connection. Let us admit the first elopement to have
edgarallanpoe,"resulted in a quarrel between the lovers, and the return home of the"
edgarallanpoe,betrayed. We are now prepared to view a second elopement (if we know
edgarallanpoe,that an elopement has again taken place) as indicating a renewal of the
edgarallanpoe,"betrayer’s advances, rather than as the result of new proposals by a"
edgarallanpoe,second individual--we are prepared to regard it as a ‘making up’ of the
edgarallanpoe,"old amour, rather than as the commencement of a new one. The chances are"
edgarallanpoe,"ten to one, that he who had once eloped with Marie, would again propose"
edgarallanpoe,"an elopement, rather than that she to whom proposals of elopement had"
edgarallanpoe,"been made by one individual, should have them made to her by another."
edgarallanpoe,"And here let me call your attention to the fact, that the time elapsing"
edgarallanpoe,"between the first ascertained, and the second supposed elopement, is"
edgarallanpoe,a few months more than the general period of the cruises of our
edgarallanpoe,men-of-war. Had the lover been interrupted in his first villany by the
edgarallanpoe,"necessity of departure to sea, and had he seized the first moment of his"
edgarallanpoe,return to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplished--or
edgarallanpoe,not yet altogether accomplished by _him?_ Of all these things we know
edgarallanpoe,nothing.
edgarallanpoe,"“You will say, however, that, in the second instance, there was no"
edgarallanpoe,elopement as imagined. Certainly not--but are we prepared to say that
edgarallanpoe,"there was not the frustrated design? Beyond St. Eustache, and perhaps"
edgarallanpoe,"Beauvais, we find no recognized, no open, no honorable suitors of Marie."
edgarallanpoe,"Of none other is there any thing said. Who, then, is the secret lover,"
edgarallanpoe,"of whom the relatives (at least most of them) know nothing, but whom"
edgarallanpoe,"Marie meets upon the morning of Sunday, and who is so deeply in her"
edgarallanpoe,"confidence, that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades"
edgarallanpoe,"of the evening descend, amid the solitary groves of the Barrière du"
edgarallanpoe,"Roule? Who is that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most of the"
edgarallanpoe,relatives know nothing? And what means the singular prophecy of Madame
edgarallanpoe,Rogêt on the morning of Marie’s departure?--‘I fear that I shall never
edgarallanpoe,see Marie again.’
edgarallanpoe,"“But if we cannot imagine Madame Rogêt privy to the design of elopement,"
edgarallanpoe,may we not at least suppose this design entertained by the girl? Upon
edgarallanpoe,"quitting home, she gave it to be understood that she was about to visit"
edgarallanpoe,her aunt in the Rue des Drômes and St. Eustache was requested to call
edgarallanpoe,"for her at dark. Now, at first glance, this fact strongly militates"
edgarallanpoe,against my suggestion;--but let us reflect. That she did meet some
edgarallanpoe,"companion, and proceed with him across the river, reaching the Barrière"
edgarallanpoe,"du Roule at so late an hour as three o’clock in the afternoon, is"
edgarallanpoe,"known. But in consenting so to accompany this individual, (_for whatever"
edgarallanpoe,"purpose--to her mother known or unknown,_) she must have thought of her"
edgarallanpoe,"expressed intention when leaving home, and of the surprise and suspicion"
edgarallanpoe,"aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor, St. Eustache, when,"
edgarallanpoe,"calling for her, at the hour appointed, in the Rue des Drômes, he should"
edgarallanpoe,"find that she had not been there, and when, moreover, upon returning to"
edgarallanpoe,"the pension with this alarming intelligence, he should become aware of"
edgarallanpoe,"her continued absence from home. She must have thought of these things,"
edgarallanpoe,"I say. She must have foreseen the chagrin of St. Eustache, the suspicion"
edgarallanpoe,of all. She could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion;
edgarallanpoe,"but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her, if we"
edgarallanpoe,suppose her not intending to return.
edgarallanpoe,“We may imagine her thinking thus--‘I am to meet a certain person for
edgarallanpoe,"the purpose of elopement, or for certain other purposes known only to"
edgarallanpoe,myself. It is necessary that there be no chance of interruption--there
edgarallanpoe,must be sufficient time given us to elude pursuit--I will give it to be
edgarallanpoe,understood that I shall visit and spend the day with my aunt at the Rue
edgarallanpoe,des Drômes--I well tell St. Eustache not to call for me until dark--in
edgarallanpoe,"this way, my absence from home for the longest possible period, without"
edgarallanpoe,"causing suspicion or anxiety, will be accounted for, and I shall gain"
edgarallanpoe,more time than in any other manner. If I bid St. Eustache call for me
edgarallanpoe,"at dark, he will be sure not to call before; but, if I wholly neglect"
edgarallanpoe,"to bid him call, my time for escape will be diminished, since it will"
edgarallanpoe,"be expected that I return the earlier, and my absence will the sooner"
edgarallanpoe,"excite anxiety. Now, if it were my design to return at all--if I had in"
edgarallanpoe,contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question--it would
edgarallanpoe,"not be my policy to bid St. Eustache call; for, calling, he will be sure"
edgarallanpoe,to ascertain that I have played him false--a fact of which I might keep
edgarallanpoe,"him for ever in ignorance, by leaving home without notifying him of my"
edgarallanpoe,"intention, by returning before dark, and by then stating that I had been"
edgarallanpoe,"to visit my aunt in the Rue des Drômes. But, as it is my design never"
edgarallanpoe,to return--or not for some weeks--or not until certain concealments are
edgarallanpoe,effected--the gaining of time is the only point about which I need give
edgarallanpoe,myself any concern.’
edgarallanpoe,"“You have observed, in your notes, that the most general opinion in"
edgarallanpoe,"relation to this sad affair is, and was from the first, that the girl"
edgarallanpoe,"had been the victim of a gang of blackguards. Now, the popular opinion,"
edgarallanpoe,"under certain conditions, is not to be disregarded. When arising of"
edgarallanpoe,itself--when manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous manner--we
edgarallanpoe,should look upon it as analogous with that _intuition_ which is the
edgarallanpoe,idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius. In ninety-nine cases from
edgarallanpoe,the hundred I would abide by its decision. But it is important that we
edgarallanpoe,find no palpable traces of _suggestion_. The opinion must be rigorously
edgarallanpoe,_the public’s own_; and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult
edgarallanpoe,"to perceive and to maintain. In the present instance, it appears to me"
edgarallanpoe,"that this ‘public opinion’ in respect to a gang, has been superinduced"
edgarallanpoe,by the collateral event which is detailed in the third of my extracts.
edgarallanpoe,"All Paris is excited by the discovered corpse of Marie, a girl young,"
edgarallanpoe,"beautiful and notorious. This corpse is found, bearing marks of"
edgarallanpoe,"violence, and floating in the river. But it is now made known that, at"
edgarallanpoe,"the very period, or about the very period, in which it is supposed that"
edgarallanpoe,"the girl was assassinated, an outrage similar in nature to that endured"
edgarallanpoe,"by the deceased, although less in extent, was perpetuated, by a gang"
edgarallanpoe,"of young ruffians, upon the person of a second young female. Is it"
edgarallanpoe,wonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular
edgarallanpoe,judgment in regard to the other unknown? This judgment awaited
edgarallanpoe,"direction, and the known outrage seemed so opportunely to afford it!"
edgarallanpoe,"Marie, too, was found in the river; and upon this very river was this"
edgarallanpoe,known outrage committed. The connexion of the two events had about it so
edgarallanpoe,"much of the palpable, that the true wonder would have been a failure"
edgarallanpoe,"of the populace to appreciate and to seize it. But, in fact, the one"
edgarallanpoe,"atrocity, known to be so committed, is, if any thing, evidence that the"
edgarallanpoe,"other, committed at a time nearly coincident, was not so committed."
edgarallanpoe,"It would have been a miracle indeed, if, while a gang of ruffians were"
edgarallanpoe,"perpetrating, at a given locality, a most unheard-of wrong, there should"
edgarallanpoe,"have been another similar gang, in a similar locality, in the same"
edgarallanpoe,"city, under the same circumstances, with the same means and appliances,"
edgarallanpoe,"engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect, at precisely the"
edgarallanpoe,"same period of time! Yet in what, if not in this marvellous train of"
edgarallanpoe,"coincidence, does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace"
edgarallanpoe,call upon us to believe?
edgarallanpoe,"“Before proceeding farther, let us consider the supposed scene of the"
edgarallanpoe,"assassination, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule. This thicket,"
edgarallanpoe,"although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public road. Within"
edgarallanpoe,"were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and"
edgarallanpoe,footstool. On the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat; on the
edgarallanpoe,"second, a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief,"
edgarallanpoe,"were also here found. The handkerchief bore the name, ‘Marie Rogêt.’"
edgarallanpoe,Fragments of dress were seen on the branches around. The earth was
edgarallanpoe,"trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a"
edgarallanpoe,violent struggle.
edgarallanpoe,“Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this
edgarallanpoe,"thicket was received by the press, and the unanimity with which it"
edgarallanpoe,"was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage, it must be"
edgarallanpoe,admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt. That it was the
edgarallanpoe,"scene, I may or I may not believe--but there was excellent reason for"
edgarallanpoe,"doubt. Had the true scene been, as Le Commerciel suggested, in the"
edgarallanpoe,"neighborhood of the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, the perpetrators of the"
edgarallanpoe,"crime, supposing them still resident in Paris, would naturally have been"
edgarallanpoe,stricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely directed into
edgarallanpoe,"the proper channel; and, in certain classes of minds, there would have"
edgarallanpoe,"arisen, at once, a sense of the necessity of some exertion to redivert"
edgarallanpoe,"this attention. And thus, the thicket of the Barrière du Roule having"
edgarallanpoe,"been already suspected, the idea of placing the articles where they were"
edgarallanpoe,"found, might have been naturally entertained. There is no real evidence,"
edgarallanpoe,"although Le Soleil so supposes, that the articles discovered had"
edgarallanpoe,been more than a very few days in the thicket; while there is much
edgarallanpoe,"circumstantial proof that they could not have remained there, without"
edgarallanpoe,"attracting attention, during the twenty days elapsing between the fatal"
edgarallanpoe,Sunday and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys. ‘They
edgarallanpoe,"were all _mildewed_ down hard,’ says Le Soleil, adopting the opinions of"
edgarallanpoe,"its predecessors, ‘with the action of the rain, and stuck together from"
edgarallanpoe,_mildew_. The grass had grown around and over some of them. The silk of
edgarallanpoe,"the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within."
edgarallanpoe,"The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all _mildewed_"
edgarallanpoe,"and rotten, and tore on being opened.’ In respect to the grass having"
edgarallanpoe,"‘grown around and over some of them,’ it is obvious that the fact"
edgarallanpoe,"could only have been ascertained from the words, and thus from the"
edgarallanpoe,"recollections, of two small boys; for these boys removed the articles"
edgarallanpoe,and took them home before they had been seen by a third party. But grass
edgarallanpoe,"will grow, especially in warm and damp weather, (such as was that of the"
edgarallanpoe,"period of the murder,) as much as two or three inches in a single day."
edgarallanpoe,"A parasol lying upon a newly turfed ground, might, in a single week,"
edgarallanpoe,be entirely concealed from sight by the upspringing grass. And touching
edgarallanpoe,that mildew upon which the editor of Le Soleil so pertinaciously
edgarallanpoe,"insists, that he employs the word no less than three times in the"
edgarallanpoe,"brief paragraph just quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this"
edgarallanpoe,"mildew? Is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus,"
edgarallanpoe,of which the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence
edgarallanpoe,within twenty-four hours?
edgarallanpoe,"“Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most triumphantly adduced"
edgarallanpoe,in support of the idea that the articles had been ‘for at least three
edgarallanpoe,"or four weeks’ in the thicket, is most absurdly null as regards any"
edgarallanpoe,"evidence of that fact. On the other hand, it is exceedingly difficult"
edgarallanpoe,to believe that these articles could have remained in the thicket
edgarallanpoe,"specified, for a longer period than a single week--for a longer period"
edgarallanpoe,than from one Sunday to the next. Those who know any thing of the
edgarallanpoe,"vicinity of Paris, know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion"
edgarallanpoe,unless at a great distance from its suburbs. Such a thing as an
edgarallanpoe,"unexplored, or even an unfrequently visited recess, amid its woods or"
edgarallanpoe,"groves, is not for a moment to be imagined. Let any one who, being at"
edgarallanpoe,"heart a lover of nature, is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat"
edgarallanpoe,"of this great metropolis--let any such one attempt, even during the"
edgarallanpoe,"weekdays, to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of natural"
edgarallanpoe,"loveliness which immediately surround us. At every second step, he will"
edgarallanpoe,find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and personal intrusion
edgarallanpoe,of some ruffian or party of carousing blackguards. He will seek privacy
edgarallanpoe,"amid the densest foliage, all in vain. Here are the very nooks where the"
edgarallanpoe,unwashed most abound--here are the temples most desecrate. With sickness
edgarallanpoe,of the heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted Paris as to
edgarallanpoe,a less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution. But if the
edgarallanpoe,"vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the week,"
edgarallanpoe,"how much more so on the Sabbath! It is now especially that, released"
edgarallanpoe,"from the claims of labor, or deprived of the customary opportunities of"
edgarallanpoe,"crime, the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town, not through"
edgarallanpoe,"love of the rural, which in his heart he despises, but by way of escape"
edgarallanpoe,from the restraints and conventionalities of society. He desires
edgarallanpoe,"less the fresh air and the green trees, than the utter license of the"
edgarallanpoe,"country. Here, at the road-side inn, or beneath the foliage of the"
edgarallanpoe,"woods, he indulges, unchecked by any eye except those of his boon"
edgarallanpoe,"companions, in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity--the joint"
edgarallanpoe,offspring of liberty and of rum. I say nothing more than what must
edgarallanpoe,"be obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I repeat that the"
edgarallanpoe,"circumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered,"
edgarallanpoe,"for a longer period--than from one Sunday to another, in any thicket in"
edgarallanpoe,"the immediate neighborhood of Paris, is to be looked upon as little less"
edgarallanpoe,than miraculous.
edgarallanpoe,“But there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that the
edgarallanpoe,articles were placed in the thicket with the view of diverting attention
edgarallanpoe,"from the real scene of the outrage. And, first, let me direct your"
edgarallanpoe,notice to the date of the discovery of the articles. Collate this with
edgarallanpoe,the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers. You
edgarallanpoe,"will find that the discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent"
edgarallanpoe,"communications sent to the evening paper. These communications, although"
edgarallanpoe,"various and apparently from various sources, tended all to the same"
edgarallanpoe,"point--viz., the directing of attention to a gang as the perpetrators"
edgarallanpoe,"of the outrage, and to the neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule as its"
edgarallanpoe,"scene. Now here, of course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of"
edgarallanpoe,"these communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the"
edgarallanpoe,articles were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well
edgarallanpoe,"have been, that the articles were not before found by the boys, for the"
edgarallanpoe,reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket; having
edgarallanpoe,"been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly"
edgarallanpoe,prior to the date of the communications by the guilty authors of these
edgarallanpoe,communications themselves.
edgarallanpoe,“This thicket was a singular--an exceedingly singular one. It was
edgarallanpoe,unusually dense. Within its naturally walled enclosure were three
edgarallanpoe,"extraordinary stones, forming a seat with a back and footstool. And this"
edgarallanpoe,"thicket, so full of a natural art, was in the immediate vicinity, within"
edgarallanpoe,"a few rods, of the dwelling of Madame Deluc, whose boys were in the"
edgarallanpoe,habit of closely examining the shrubberies about them in search of
edgarallanpoe,the bark of the sassafras. Would it be a rash wager--a wager of one
edgarallanpoe,thousand to one--that a day never passed over the heads of these boys
edgarallanpoe,"without finding at least one of them ensconced in the umbrageous hall,"
edgarallanpoe,and enthroned upon its natural throne? Those who would hesitate at such
edgarallanpoe,"a wager, have either never been boys themselves, or have forgotten the"
edgarallanpoe,boyish nature. I repeat--it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the
edgarallanpoe,"articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered, for a longer"
edgarallanpoe,period than one or two days; and that thus there is good ground for
edgarallanpoe,"suspicion, in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of Le Soleil, that they"
edgarallanpoe,"were, at a comparatively late date, deposited where found."
edgarallanpoe,“But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so
edgarallanpoe,"deposited, than any which I have as yet urged. And, now, let me beg"
edgarallanpoe,your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles. On the
edgarallanpoe,upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf; scattered
edgarallanpoe,"around, were a parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the"
edgarallanpoe,"name, ‘Marie Rogêt.’ Here is just such an arrangement as would naturally"
edgarallanpoe,be made by a not over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles
edgarallanpoe,naturally. But it is by no means a really natural arrangement. I
edgarallanpoe,should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and
edgarallanpoe,"trampled under foot. In the narrow limits of that bower, it would have"
edgarallanpoe,been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained
edgarallanpoe,"a position upon the stones, when subjected to the brushing to and fro"
edgarallanpoe,"of many struggling persons. ‘There was evidence,’ it is said, ‘of a"
edgarallanpoe,"struggle; and the earth was trampled, the bushes were broken,’--but the"
edgarallanpoe,petticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves. ‘The
edgarallanpoe,pieces of the frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide
edgarallanpoe,and six inches long. One part was the hem of the frock and it had been
edgarallanpoe,"mended. They looked like strips torn off.’ Here, inadvertently, Le"
edgarallanpoe,"Soleil has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase. The pieces, as"
edgarallanpoe,"described, do indeed ‘look like strips torn off;’ but purposely and by"
edgarallanpoe,"hand. It is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is ‘torn off,’"
edgarallanpoe,"from any garment such as is now in question, by the agency of a thorn."
edgarallanpoe,"From the very nature of such fabrics, a thorn or nail becoming entangled"
edgarallanpoe,"in them, tears them rectangularly--divides them into two longitudinal"
edgarallanpoe,"rents, at right angles with each other, and meeting at an apex where the"
edgarallanpoe,thorn enters--but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece ‘torn
edgarallanpoe,"off.’ I never so knew it, nor did you. To tear a piece off from such"
edgarallanpoe,"fabric, two distinct forces, in different directions, will be, in almost"
edgarallanpoe,"every case, required. If there be two edges to the fabric--if, for"
edgarallanpoe,"example, it be a pocket-handkerchief, and it is desired to tear from it"
edgarallanpoe,"a slip, then, and then only, will the one force serve the purpose. But"
edgarallanpoe,"in the present case the question is of a dress, presenting but one edge."
edgarallanpoe,"To tear a piece from the interior, where no edge is presented, could"
edgarallanpoe,"only be effected by a miracle through the agency of thorns, and no one"
edgarallanpoe,"thorn could accomplish it. But, even where an edge is presented, two"
edgarallanpoe,"thorns will be necessary, operating, the one in two distinct directions,"
edgarallanpoe,and the other in one. And this in the supposition that the edge is
edgarallanpoe,"unhemmed. If hemmed, the matter is nearly out of the question. We thus"
edgarallanpoe,see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being ‘torn
edgarallanpoe,off’ through the simple agency of ‘thorns;’ yet we are required to
edgarallanpoe,believe not only that one piece but that many have been so torn. ‘And
edgarallanpoe,"one part,’ too, ‘was the hem of the frock!’ Another piece was ‘part"
edgarallanpoe,"of the skirt, not the hem,’--that is to say, was torn completely out"
edgarallanpoe,"through the agency of thorns, from the uncaged interior of the"
edgarallanpoe,"dress! These, I say, are things which one may well be pardoned for"
edgarallanpoe,"disbelieving; yet, taken collectedly, they form, perhaps, less of"
edgarallanpoe,"reasonable ground for suspicion, than the one startling circumstance of"
edgarallanpoe,"the articles’ having been left in this thicket at all, by any murderers"
edgarallanpoe,who had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse. You will not
edgarallanpoe,"have apprehended me rightly, however, if you suppose it my design to"
edgarallanpoe,deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage. There might have been a
edgarallanpoe,"wrong here, or, more possibly, an accident at Madame Deluc’s. But, in"
edgarallanpoe,"fact, this is a point of minor importance. We are not engaged in an"
edgarallanpoe,"attempt to discover the scene, but to produce the perpetrators of the"
edgarallanpoe,"murder. What I have adduced, notwithstanding the minuteness with which I"
edgarallanpoe,"have adduced it, has been with the view, first, to show the folly of the"
edgarallanpoe,"positive and headlong assertions of Le Soleil, but secondly and chiefly,"
edgarallanpoe,"to bring you, by the most natural route, to a further contemplation of"
edgarallanpoe,"the doubt whether this assassination has, or has not been, the work of a"
edgarallanpoe,gang.
edgarallanpoe,“We will resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting details
edgarallanpoe,of the surgeon examined at the inquest. It is only necessary to say that
edgarallanpoe,"his published inferences, in regard to the number of ruffians, have been"
edgarallanpoe,"properly ridiculed as unjust and totally baseless, by all the reputable"
edgarallanpoe,anatomists of Paris. Not that the matter might not have been as
edgarallanpoe,"inferred, but that there was no ground for the inference:--was there not"
edgarallanpoe,much for another?
edgarallanpoe,“Let us reflect now upon ‘the traces of a struggle;’ and let me ask what
edgarallanpoe,these traces have been supposed to demonstrate. A gang. But do they not
edgarallanpoe,rather demonstrate the absence of a gang? What struggle could have taken
edgarallanpoe,place--what struggle so violent and so enduring as to have left its
edgarallanpoe,‘traces’ in all directions--between a weak and defenceless girl and the
edgarallanpoe,gang of ruffians imagined? The silent grasp of a few rough arms and all
edgarallanpoe,would have been over. The victim must have been absolutely passive at
edgarallanpoe,their will. You will here bear in mind that the arguments urged against
edgarallanpoe,"the thicket as the scene, are applicable in chief part, only against it"
edgarallanpoe,as the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single individual.
edgarallanpoe,"If we imagine but one violator, we can conceive, and thus only conceive,"
edgarallanpoe,the struggle of so violent and so obstinate a nature as to have left the
edgarallanpoe,‘traces’ apparent.
edgarallanpoe,“And again. I have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited by the
edgarallanpoe,fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain at all in
edgarallanpoe,the thicket where discovered. It seems almost impossible that these
edgarallanpoe,evidences of guilt should have been accidentally left where found. There
edgarallanpoe,was sufficient presence of mind (it is supposed) to remove the corpse;
edgarallanpoe,and yet a more positive evidence than the corpse itself (whose features
edgarallanpoe,"might have been quickly obliterated by decay,) is allowed to lie"
edgarallanpoe,conspicuously in the scene of the outrage--I allude to the handkerchief
edgarallanpoe,"with the name of the deceased. If this was accident, it was not"
edgarallanpoe,the accident of a gang. We can imagine it only the accident of an
edgarallanpoe,individual. Let us see. An individual has committed the murder. He
edgarallanpoe,is alone with the ghost of the departed. He is appalled by what lies
edgarallanpoe,"motionless before him. The fury of his passion is over, and there is"
edgarallanpoe,abundant room in his heart for the natural awe of the deed. His is none
edgarallanpoe,of that confidence which the presence of numbers inevitably inspires.
edgarallanpoe,He is alone with the dead. He trembles and is bewildered. Yet there is
edgarallanpoe,"a necessity for disposing of the corpse. He bears it to the river, but"
edgarallanpoe,"leaves behind him the other evidences of guilt; for it is difficult, if"
edgarallanpoe,"not impossible to carry all the burthen at once, and it will be easy to"
edgarallanpoe,return for what is left. But in his toilsome journey to the water his
edgarallanpoe,fears redouble within him. The sounds of life encompass his path. A
edgarallanpoe,dozen times he hears or fancies the step of an observer. Even the very
edgarallanpoe,"lights from the city bewilder him. Yet, in time and by long and frequent"
edgarallanpoe,"pauses of deep agony, he reaches the river’s brink, and disposes of"
edgarallanpoe,his ghastly charge--perhaps through the medium of a boat. But now what
edgarallanpoe,treasure does the world hold--what threat of vengeance could it hold
edgarallanpoe,out--which would have power to urge the return of that lonely murderer
edgarallanpoe,"over that toilsome and perilous path, to the thicket and its blood"
edgarallanpoe,"chilling recollections? He returns not, let the consequences be what"
edgarallanpoe,they may. He could not return if he would. His sole thought is immediate
edgarallanpoe,escape. He turns his back forever upon those dreadful shrubberies and
edgarallanpoe,flees as from the wrath to come.
edgarallanpoe,“But how with a gang? Their number would have inspired them with
edgarallanpoe,"confidence; if, indeed confidence is ever wanting in the breast of the"
edgarallanpoe,arrant blackguard; and of arrant blackguards alone are the supposed
edgarallanpoe,"gangs ever constituted. Their number, I say, would have prevented the"
edgarallanpoe,bewildering and unreasoning terror which I have imagined to paralyze the
edgarallanpoe,"single man. Could we suppose an oversight in one, or two, or three, this"
edgarallanpoe,oversight would have been remedied by a fourth. They would have left
edgarallanpoe,nothing behind them; for their number would have enabled them to carry
edgarallanpoe,all at once. There would have been no need of return.
edgarallanpoe,“Consider now the circumstance that in the outer garment of the corpse
edgarallanpoe,"when found, ‘a slip, about a foot wide had been torn upward from the"
edgarallanpoe,"bottom hem to the waist wound three times round the waist, and secured"
edgarallanpoe,by a sort of hitch in the back.’ This was done with the obvious design
edgarallanpoe,of affording a handle by which to carry the body. But would any number
edgarallanpoe,"of men have dreamed of resorting to such an expedient? To three or four,"
edgarallanpoe,"the limbs of the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient, but"
edgarallanpoe,the best possible hold. The device is that of a single individual; and
edgarallanpoe,"this brings us to the fact that ‘between the thicket and the river, the"
edgarallanpoe,"rails of the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evident"
edgarallanpoe,traces of some heavy burden having been dragged along it!’ But would a
edgarallanpoe,number of men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble of taking
edgarallanpoe,"down a fence, for the purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they"
edgarallanpoe,might have lifted over any fence in an instant? Would a number of men
edgarallanpoe,have so dragged a corpse at all as to have left evident traces of the
edgarallanpoe,dragging?
edgarallanpoe,“And here we must refer to an observation of Le Commerciel; an
edgarallanpoe,"observation upon which I have already, in some measure, commented. ‘A"
edgarallanpoe,"piece,’ says this journal, ‘of one of the unfortunate girl’s petticoats"
edgarallanpoe,"was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her"
edgarallanpoe,"head, probably to prevent screams. This was done by fellows who had no"
edgarallanpoe,pocket-handkerchiefs.’
edgarallanpoe,“I have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never without a
edgarallanpoe,pocket-handkerchief. But it is not to this fact that I now especially
edgarallanpoe,advert. That it was not through want of a handkerchief for the purpose
edgarallanpoe,"imagined by Le Commerciel, that this bandage was employed, is rendered"
edgarallanpoe,apparent by the handkerchief left in the thicket; and that the object
edgarallanpoe,"was not ‘to prevent screams’ appears, also, from the bandage having been"
edgarallanpoe,employed in preference to what would so much better have answered
edgarallanpoe,the purpose. But the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in
edgarallanpoe,"question as ‘found around the neck, fitting loosely, and secured with"
edgarallanpoe,"a hard knot.’ These words are sufficiently vague, but differ materially"
edgarallanpoe,"from those of Le Commerciel. The slip was eighteen inches wide, and"
edgarallanpoe,"therefore, although of muslin, would form a strong band when folded or"
edgarallanpoe,rumpled longitudinally. And thus rumpled it was discovered. My inference
edgarallanpoe,"is this. The solitary murderer, having borne the corpse, for some"
edgarallanpoe,"distance, (whether from the thicket or elsewhere) by means of the"
edgarallanpoe,"bandage hitched around its middle, found the weight, in this mode"
edgarallanpoe,"of procedure, too much for his strength. He resolved to drag the"
edgarallanpoe,burthen--the evidence goes to show that it was dragged. With this object
edgarallanpoe,"in view, it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of"
edgarallanpoe,"the extremities. It could be best attached about the neck, where the"
edgarallanpoe,"head would prevent its slipping off. And, now, the murderer bethought"
edgarallanpoe,"him, unquestionably, of the bandage about the loins. He would have used"
edgarallanpoe,"this, but for its volution about the corpse, the hitch which embarrassed"
edgarallanpoe,"it, and the reflection that it had not been ‘torn off’ from the garment."
edgarallanpoe,"It was easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat. He tore it, made"
edgarallanpoe,"it fast about the neck, and so dragged his victim to the brink of the"
edgarallanpoe,"river. That this ‘bandage,’ only attainable with trouble and delay, and"
edgarallanpoe,but imperfectly answering its purpose--that this bandage was employed
edgarallanpoe,"at all, demonstrates that the necessity for its employment sprang from"
edgarallanpoe,circumstances arising at a period when the handkerchief was no longer
edgarallanpoe,"attainable--that is to say, arising, as we have imagined, after quitting"
edgarallanpoe,"the thicket, (if the thicket it was), and on the road between the"
edgarallanpoe,thicket and the river.
edgarallanpoe,"“But the evidence, you will say, of Madame Deluc, (!) points especially"
edgarallanpoe,"to the presence of a gang, in the vicinity of the thicket, at or about"
edgarallanpoe,the epoch of the murder. This I grant. I doubt if there were not a dozen
edgarallanpoe,"gangs, such as described by Madame Deluc, in and about the vicinity of"
edgarallanpoe,the Barrière du Roule at or about the period of this tragedy. But the
edgarallanpoe,"gang which has drawn upon itself the pointed animadversion, although the"
edgarallanpoe,"somewhat tardy and very suspicious evidence of Madame Deluc, is the"
edgarallanpoe,only gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous old lady
edgarallanpoe,"as having eaten her cakes and swallowed her brandy, without putting"
edgarallanpoe,themselves to the trouble of making her payment. Et hinc illæ iræ?
edgarallanpoe,“But what is the precise evidence of Madame Deluc? ‘A gang of miscreants
edgarallanpoe,"made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without"
edgarallanpoe,"making payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl,"
edgarallanpoe,"returned to the inn about dusk, and recrossed the river as if in great"
edgarallanpoe,haste.’
edgarallanpoe,“Now this ‘great haste’ very possibly seemed greater haste in the eyes
edgarallanpoe,"of Madame Deluc, since she dwelt lingeringly and lamentingly upon her"
edgarallanpoe,violated cakes and ale--cakes and ale for which she might still have
edgarallanpoe,"entertained a faint hope of compensation. Why, otherwise, since it was"
edgarallanpoe,"about dusk, should she make a point of the haste? It is no cause for"
edgarallanpoe,"wonder, surely, that even a gang of blackguards should make haste to"
edgarallanpoe,"get home, when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats, when storm"
edgarallanpoe,"impends, and when night approaches."
edgarallanpoe,“I say approaches; for the night had not yet arrived. It was only about
edgarallanpoe,dusk that the indecent haste of these ‘miscreants’ offended the sober
edgarallanpoe,eyes of Madame Deluc. But we are told that it was upon this very evening
edgarallanpoe,"that Madame Deluc, as well as her eldest son, ‘heard the screams of a"
edgarallanpoe,female in the vicinity of the inn.’ And in what words does Madame Deluc
edgarallanpoe,designate the period of the evening at which these screams were heard?
edgarallanpoe,"‘It was soon after dark,’ she says. But ‘soon after dark,’ is, at least,"
edgarallanpoe,dark; and ‘about dusk’ is as certainly daylight. Thus it is abundantly
edgarallanpoe,clear that the gang quitted the Barrière du Roule prior to the screams
edgarallanpoe,"overheard (?) by Madame Deluc. And although, in all the many reports of"
edgarallanpoe,"the evidence, the relative expressions in question are distinctly and"
edgarallanpoe,invariably employed just as I have employed them in this conversation
edgarallanpoe,"with yourself, no notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has, as yet,"
edgarallanpoe,"been taken by any of the public journals, or by any of the Myrmidons of"
edgarallanpoe,police.
edgarallanpoe,"“I shall add but one to the arguments against a gang; but this one has,"
edgarallanpoe,"to my own understanding at least, a weight altogether irresistible."
edgarallanpoe,"Under the circumstances of large reward offered, and full pardon to"
edgarallanpoe,"any King’s evidence, it is not to be imagined, for a moment, that some"
edgarallanpoe,"member of a gang of low ruffians, or of any body of men, would not long"
edgarallanpoe,"ago have betrayed his accomplices. Each one of a gang so placed, is not"
edgarallanpoe,"so much greedy of reward, or anxious for escape, as fearful of betrayal."
edgarallanpoe,He betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed. That
edgarallanpoe,"the secret has not been divulged, is the very best of proof that it is,"
edgarallanpoe,"in fact, a secret. The horrors of this dark deed are known only to one,"
edgarallanpoe,"or two, living human beings, and to God."
edgarallanpoe,“Let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long analysis.
edgarallanpoe,We have attained the idea either of a fatal accident under the roof of
edgarallanpoe,"Madame Deluc, or of a murder perpetrated, in the thicket at the Barrière"
edgarallanpoe,"du Roule, by a lover, or at least by an intimate and secret associate of"
edgarallanpoe,"the deceased. This associate is of swarthy complexion. This complexion,"
edgarallanpoe,"the ‘hitch’ in the bandage, and the ‘sailor’s knot,’ with which the"
edgarallanpoe,"bonnet-ribbon is tied, point to a seaman. His companionship with the"
edgarallanpoe,"deceased, a gay, but not an abject young girl, designates him as"
edgarallanpoe,above the grade of the common sailor. Here the well written and urgent
edgarallanpoe,communications to the journals are much in the way of corroboration. The
edgarallanpoe,"circumstance of the first elopement, as mentioned by Le Mercurie, tends"
edgarallanpoe,to blend the idea of this seaman with that of the ‘naval officer’ who is
edgarallanpoe,first known to have led the unfortunate into crime.
edgarallanpoe,"“And here, most fitly, comes the consideration of the continued"
edgarallanpoe,absence of him of the dark complexion. Let me pause to observe that the
edgarallanpoe,complexion of this man is dark and swarthy; it was no common swarthiness
edgarallanpoe,"which constituted the sole point of remembrance, both as regards Valence"
edgarallanpoe,and Madame Deluc. But why is this man absent? Was he murdered by the
edgarallanpoe,"gang? If so, why are there only traces of the assassinated girl? The"
edgarallanpoe,scene of the two outrages will naturally be supposed identical. And
edgarallanpoe,where is his corpse? The assassins would most probably have disposed
edgarallanpoe,"of both in the same way. But it may be said that this man lives, and is"
edgarallanpoe,"deterred from making himself known, through dread of being charged with"
edgarallanpoe,the murder. This consideration might be supposed to operate upon him
edgarallanpoe,now--at this late period--since it has been given in evidence that he
edgarallanpoe,was seen with Marie--but it would have had no force at the period of the
edgarallanpoe,deed. The first impulse of an innocent man would have been to announce
edgarallanpoe,"the outrage, and to aid in identifying the ruffians. This policy would"
edgarallanpoe,have suggested. He had been seen with the girl. He had crossed the river
edgarallanpoe,with her in an open ferry-boat. The denouncing of the assassins would
edgarallanpoe,"have appeared, even to an idiot, the surest and sole means of relieving"
edgarallanpoe,"himself from suspicion. We cannot suppose him, on the night of the fatal"
edgarallanpoe,"Sunday, both innocent himself and incognizant of an outrage committed."
edgarallanpoe,Yet only under such circumstances is it possible to imagine that he
edgarallanpoe,"would have failed, if alive, in the denouncement of the assassins."
edgarallanpoe,"“And what means are ours, of attaining the truth? We shall find these"
edgarallanpoe,means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed. Let us sift
edgarallanpoe,to the bottom this affair of the first elopement. Let us know the
edgarallanpoe,"full history of ‘the officer,’ with his present circumstances, and"
edgarallanpoe,his whereabouts at the precise period of the murder. Let us carefully
edgarallanpoe,compare with each other the various communications sent to the evening
edgarallanpoe,"paper, in which the object was to inculpate a gang. This done, let us"
edgarallanpoe,"compare these communications, both as regards style and MS., with"
edgarallanpoe,"those sent to the morning paper, at a previous period, and insisting so"
edgarallanpoe,"vehemently upon the guilt of Mennais. And, all this done, let us again"
edgarallanpoe,compare these various communications with the known MSS. of the officer.
edgarallanpoe,"Let us endeavor to ascertain, by repeated questionings of Madame Deluc"
edgarallanpoe,"and her boys, as well as of the omnibus driver, Valence, something more"
edgarallanpoe,of the personal appearance and bearing of the ‘man of dark complexion.’
edgarallanpoe,"Queries, skilfully directed, will not fail to elicit, from some of"
edgarallanpoe,"these parties, information on this particular point (or upon"
edgarallanpoe,others)--information which the parties themselves may not even be aware
edgarallanpoe,of possessing. And let us now trace the boat picked up by the bargeman
edgarallanpoe,"on the morning of Monday the twenty-third of June, and which was"
edgarallanpoe,"removed from the barge-office, without the cognizance of the officer"
edgarallanpoe,"in attendance, and without the rudder, at some period prior to the"
edgarallanpoe,discovery of the corpse. With a proper caution and perseverance we shall
edgarallanpoe,infallibly trace this boat; for not only can the bargeman who picked
edgarallanpoe,"it up identify it, but the rudder is at hand. The rudder of a sail-boat"
edgarallanpoe,"would not have been abandoned, without inquiry, by one altogether at"
edgarallanpoe,ease in heart. And here let me pause to insinuate a question. There was
edgarallanpoe,no advertisement of the picking up of this boat. It was silently
edgarallanpoe,"taken to the barge-office, and as silently removed. But its owner or"
edgarallanpoe,"employer--how happened he, at so early a period as Tuesday morning, to"
edgarallanpoe,"be informed, without the agency of advertisement, of the locality of"
edgarallanpoe,"the boat taken up on Monday, unless we imagine some connexion with the"
edgarallanpoe,navy--some personal permanent connexion leading to cognizance of its
edgarallanpoe,minute in interests--its petty local news?
edgarallanpoe,"“In speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the shore,"
edgarallanpoe,I have already suggested the probability of his availing himself of a
edgarallanpoe,boat. Now we are to understand that Marie Rogêt was precipitated from a
edgarallanpoe,boat. This would naturally have been the case. The corpse could not have
edgarallanpoe,been trusted to the shallow waters of the shore. The peculiar marks on
edgarallanpoe,the back and shoulders of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat.
edgarallanpoe,That the body was found without weight is also corroborative of the
edgarallanpoe,idea. If thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached. We can
edgarallanpoe,only account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have neglected
edgarallanpoe,the precaution of supplying himself with it before pushing off. In the
edgarallanpoe,"act of consigning the corpse to the water, he would unquestionably have"
edgarallanpoe,noticed his oversight; but then no remedy would have been at hand.
edgarallanpoe,Any risk would have been preferred to a return to that accursed shore.
edgarallanpoe,"Having rid himself of his ghastly charge, the murderer would have"
edgarallanpoe,"hastened to the city. There, at some obscure wharf, he would have leaped"
edgarallanpoe,on land. But the boat--would he have secured it? He would have been
edgarallanpoe,"in too great haste for such things as securing a boat. Moreover, in"
edgarallanpoe,"fastening it to the wharf, he would have felt as if securing evidence"
edgarallanpoe,"against himself. His natural thought would have been to cast from him,"
edgarallanpoe,"as far as possible, all that had held connection with his crime. He"
edgarallanpoe,"would not only have fled from the wharf, but he would not have permitted"
edgarallanpoe,the boat to remain. Assuredly he would have cast it adrift. Let us
edgarallanpoe,"pursue our fancies.--In the morning, the wretch is stricken with"
edgarallanpoe,unutterable horror at finding that the boat has been picked up and
edgarallanpoe,detained at a locality which he is in the daily habit of frequenting
edgarallanpoe,"--at a locality, perhaps, which his duty compels him to frequent. The"
edgarallanpoe,"next night, without daring to ask for the rudder, he removes it. Now"
edgarallanpoe,where is that rudderless boat? Let it be one of our first purposes
edgarallanpoe,"to discover. With the first glimpse we obtain of it, the dawn of our"
edgarallanpoe,"success shall begin. This boat shall guide us, with a rapidity which"
edgarallanpoe,"will surprise even ourselves, to him who employed it in the midnight of"
edgarallanpoe,"the fatal Sabbath. Corroboration will rise upon corroboration, and the"
edgarallanpoe,murderer will be traced.”
edgarallanpoe,"[For reasons which we shall not specify, but which to many readers will"
edgarallanpoe,"appear obvious, we have taken the liberty of here omitting, from the"
edgarallanpoe,"MSS. placed in our hands, such portion as details the following up of"
edgarallanpoe,the apparently slight clew obtained by Dupin. We feel it advisable only
edgarallanpoe,"to state, in brief, that the result desired was brought to pass; and"
edgarallanpoe,"that the Prefect fulfilled punctually, although with reluctance, the"
edgarallanpoe,terms of his compact with the Chevalier. Mr. Poe’s article concludes
edgarallanpoe,with the following words.--Eds. (*23)]
edgarallanpoe,It will be understood that I speak of coincidences and no more. What
edgarallanpoe,I have said above upon this topic must suffice. In my own heart there
edgarallanpoe,"dwells no faith in præter-nature. That Nature and its God are two, no"
edgarallanpoe,"man who thinks, will deny. That the latter, creating the former, can, at"
edgarallanpoe,"will, control or modify it, is also unquestionable. I say “at will;” for"
edgarallanpoe,"the question is of will, and not, as the insanity of logic has assumed,"
edgarallanpoe,"of power. It is not that the Deity cannot modify his laws, but that we"
edgarallanpoe,insult him in imagining a possible necessity for modification. In their
edgarallanpoe,origin these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which
edgarallanpoe,could lie in the Future. With God all is Now.
edgarallanpoe,"I repeat, then, that I speak of these things only as of coincidences."
edgarallanpoe,And farther: in what I relate it will be seen that between the fate of
edgarallanpoe,"the unhappy Mary Cecilia Rogers, so far as that fate is known, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"fate of one Marie Rogêt up to a certain epoch in her history, there has"
edgarallanpoe,existed a parallel in the contemplation of whose wonderful exactitude
edgarallanpoe,the reason becomes embarrassed. I say all this will be seen. But let it
edgarallanpoe,"not for a moment be supposed that, in proceeding with the sad narrative"
edgarallanpoe,"of Marie from the epoch just mentioned, and in tracing to its dénouement"
edgarallanpoe,"the mystery which enshrouded her, it is my covert design to hint at an"
edgarallanpoe,"extension of the parallel, or even to suggest that the measures adopted"
edgarallanpoe,"in Paris for the discovery of the assassin of a grisette, or measures"
edgarallanpoe,"founded in any similar ratiocination, would produce any similar result."
edgarallanpoe,"For, in respect to the latter branch of the supposition, it should be"
edgarallanpoe,considered that the most trifling variation in the facts of the
edgarallanpoe,"two cases might give rise to the most important miscalculations,"
edgarallanpoe,"by diverting thoroughly the two courses of events; very much as,"
edgarallanpoe,"in arithmetic, an error which, in its own individuality, may be"
edgarallanpoe,"inappreciable, produces, at length, by dint of multiplication at all"
edgarallanpoe,"points of the process, a result enormously at variance with truth. And,"
edgarallanpoe,"in regard to the former branch, we must not fail to hold in view that"
edgarallanpoe,"the very Calculus of Probabilities to which I have referred, forbids all"
edgarallanpoe,idea of the extension of the parallel:--forbids it with a positiveness
edgarallanpoe,strong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has already been
edgarallanpoe,"long-drawn and exact. This is one of those anomalous propositions which,"
edgarallanpoe,"seemingly appealing to thought altogether apart from the mathematical,"
edgarallanpoe,"is yet one which only the mathematician can fully entertain. Nothing,"
edgarallanpoe,"for example, is more difficult than to convince the merely general"
edgarallanpoe,reader that the fact of sixes having been thrown twice in succession by
edgarallanpoe,"a player at dice, is sufficient cause for betting the largest odds that"
edgarallanpoe,sixes will not be thrown in the third attempt. A suggestion to this
edgarallanpoe,effect is usually rejected by the intellect at once. It does not
edgarallanpoe,"appear that the two throws which have been completed, and which lie now"
edgarallanpoe,"absolutely in the Past, can have influence upon the throw which exists"
edgarallanpoe,only in the Future. The chance for throwing sixes seems to be precisely
edgarallanpoe,"as it was at any ordinary time--that is to say, subject only to the"
edgarallanpoe,influence of the various other throws which may be made by the dice. And
edgarallanpoe,this is a reflection which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts
edgarallanpoe,to controvert it are received more frequently with a derisive smile
edgarallanpoe,than with anything like respectful attention. The error here involved--a
edgarallanpoe,gross error redolent of mischief--I cannot pretend to expose within the
edgarallanpoe,limits assigned me at present; and with the philosophical it needs
edgarallanpoe,no exposure. It may be sufficient here to say that it forms one of an
edgarallanpoe,infinite series of mistakes which arise in the path of Reason through
edgarallanpoe,her propensity for seeking truth in detail.
edgarallanpoe,Footnotes--Marie Rogêt
edgarallanpoe,"(*1) Upon the original publication of “Marie Roget,” the foot-notes now"
edgarallanpoe,appended were considered unnecessary; but the lapse of several years
edgarallanpoe,"since the tragedy upon which the tale is based, renders it expedient"
edgarallanpoe,"to give them, and also to say a few words in explanation of the general"
edgarallanpoe,"design. A young girl, Mary Cecilia Rogers, was murdered in the"
edgarallanpoe,"vicinity of New York; and, although her death occasioned an intense and"
edgarallanpoe,"long-enduring excitement, the mystery attending it had remained"
edgarallanpoe,unsolved at the period when the present paper was written and published
edgarallanpoe,"(November, 1842). Herein, under pretence of relating the fate of"
edgarallanpoe,"a Parisian grisette, the author has followed in minute detail, the"
edgarallanpoe,"essential, while merely paralleling the inessential facts of the real"
edgarallanpoe,murder of Mary Rogers. Thus all argument founded upon the fiction is
edgarallanpoe,applicable to the truth: and the investigation of the truth was the
edgarallanpoe,object. The “Mystery of Marie Roget” was composed at a distance from the
edgarallanpoe,"scene of the atrocity, and with no other means of investigation than the"
edgarallanpoe,newspapers afforded. Thus much escaped the writer of which he could have
edgarallanpoe,"availed himself had he been upon the spot, and visited the localities."
edgarallanpoe,"It may not be improper to record, nevertheless, that the confessions of"
edgarallanpoe,"two persons, (one of them the Madame Deluc of the narrative) made, at"
edgarallanpoe,"different periods, long subsequent to the publication, confirmed, in"
edgarallanpoe,"full, not only the general conclusion, but absolutely all the chief"
edgarallanpoe,hypothetical details by which that conclusion was attained.

edgarallanpoe,apparent danger--with thorough control of the machine--and in the
edgarallanpoe,inconceivably brief period of seventy-five hours from shore to shore!
edgarallanpoe,"By the energy of an agent at Charleston, S.C., we are enabled to be"
edgarallanpoe,the first to furnish the public with a detailed account of this most
edgarallanpoe,"extraordinary voyage, which was performed between Saturday, the 6th"
edgarallanpoe,"instant, at 11, A.M., and 2, P.M., on Tuesday, the 9th instant, by Sir"
edgarallanpoe,"Everard Bringhurst; Mr. Osborne, a nephew of Lord Bentinck’s; Mr. Monck"
edgarallanpoe,"Mason and Mr. Robert Holland, the well-known æronauts; Mr. Harrison"
edgarallanpoe,"Ainsworth, author of “Jack Sheppard,” &c.; and Mr. Henson, the"
edgarallanpoe,projector of the late unsuccessful flying machine--with two seamen from
edgarallanpoe,"Woolwich--in all, eight persons. The particulars furnished below may be"
edgarallanpoe,"relied on as authentic and accurate in every respect, as, with a slight"
edgarallanpoe,"exception, they are copied _verbatim_ from the joint diaries of Mr."
edgarallanpoe,"Monck Mason and Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, to whose politeness our agent is"
edgarallanpoe,"also indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon itself,"
edgarallanpoe,"its construction, and other matters of interest. The only alteration in"
edgarallanpoe,"the MS. received, has been made for the purpose of throwing the hurried"
edgarallanpoe,"account of our agent, Mr. Forsyth, into a connected and intelligible"
edgarallanpoe,form.
edgarallanpoe,“THE BALLOON.
edgarallanpoe,"“Two very decided failures, of late--those of Mr. Henson and Sir George"
edgarallanpoe,Cayley--had much weakened the public interest in the subject of aerial
edgarallanpoe,navigation. Mr. Henson’s scheme (which at first was considered very
edgarallanpoe,"feasible even by men of science,) was founded upon the principle of an"
edgarallanpoe,"inclined plane, started from an eminence by an extrinsic force, applied"
edgarallanpoe,"and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes, in form and number"
edgarallanpoe,"resembling the vanes of a windmill. But, in all the experiments made"
edgarallanpoe,"with models at the Adelaide Gallery, it was found that the operation of"
edgarallanpoe,"these fans not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded"
edgarallanpoe,"its flight. The only propelling force it ever exhibited, was the mere"
edgarallanpoe,_impetus_ acquired from the descent of the inclined plane; and this
edgarallanpoe,"_impetus_ carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest, than"
edgarallanpoe,when they were in motion--a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their
edgarallanpoe,"inutility; and in the absence of the propelling, which was also the"
edgarallanpoe,"_sustaining_ power, the whole fabric would necessarily descend."
edgarallanpoe,This consideration led Sir George Cayley to think only of adapting
edgarallanpoe,a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of
edgarallanpoe,"support--in a word, to a balloon; the idea, however, being novel,"
edgarallanpoe,"or original, with Sir George, only so far as regards the mode of its"
edgarallanpoe,application to practice. He exhibited a model of his invention at the
edgarallanpoe,"Polytechnic Institution. The propelling principle, or power, was here,"
edgarallanpoe,"also, applied to interrupted surfaces, or vanes, put in revolution."
edgarallanpoe,"These vanes were four in number, but were found entirely ineffectual in"
edgarallanpoe,"moving the balloon, or in aiding its ascending power. The whole project"
edgarallanpoe,was thus a complete failure.
edgarallanpoe,“It was at this juncture that Mr. Monck Mason (whose voyage from Dover
edgarallanpoe,"to Weilburg in the balloon, “Nassau,” occasioned so much excitement in"
edgarallanpoe,"1837,) conceived the idea of employing the principle of the Archimedean"
edgarallanpoe,screw for the purpose of propulsion through the air--rightly
edgarallanpoe,"attributing the failure of Mr. Henson’s scheme, and of Sir George"
edgarallanpoe,"Cayley’s, to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes."
edgarallanpoe,"He made the first public experiment at Willis’s Rooms, but afterward"
edgarallanpoe,removed his model to the Adelaide Gallery.
edgarallanpoe,"“Like Sir George Cayley’s balloon, his own was an ellipsoid. Its"
edgarallanpoe,"length was thirteen feet six inches--height, six feet eight inches. It"
edgarallanpoe,"contained about three hundred and twenty cubic feet of gas, which, if"
edgarallanpoe,"pure hydrogen, would support twenty-one pounds upon its first inflation,"
edgarallanpoe,before the gas has time to deteriorate or escape. The weight of the
edgarallanpoe,whole machine and apparatus was seventeen pounds--leaving about four
edgarallanpoe,"pounds to spare. Beneath the centre of the balloon, was a frame of light"
edgarallanpoe,"wood, about nine feet long, and rigged on to the balloon itself with"
edgarallanpoe,a network in the customary manner. From this framework was suspended a
edgarallanpoe,wicker basket or car.
edgarallanpoe,"“The screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube, eighteen inches in"
edgarallanpoe,"length, through which, upon a semi-spiral inclined at fifteen degrees,"
edgarallanpoe,"pass a series of steel wire radii, two feet long, and thus projecting a"
edgarallanpoe,foot on either side. These radii are connected at the outer extremities
edgarallanpoe,by two bands of flattened wire--the whole in this manner forming the
edgarallanpoe,"framework of the screw, which is completed by a covering of oiled silk"
edgarallanpoe,"cut into gores, and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform"
edgarallanpoe,surface. At each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of
edgarallanpoe,hollow brass tube descending from the hoop. In the lower ends of these
edgarallanpoe,tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve. From the end
edgarallanpoe,"of the axis which is next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel, connecting"
edgarallanpoe,the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the
edgarallanpoe,"car. By the operation of this spring, the screw is made to revolve with"
edgarallanpoe,"great rapidity, communicating a progressive motion to the whole. By"
edgarallanpoe,"means of the rudder, the machine was readily turned in any direction."
edgarallanpoe,"The spring was of great power, compared with its dimensions, being"
edgarallanpoe,capable of raising forty-five pounds upon a barrel of four inches
edgarallanpoe,"diameter, after the first turn, and gradually increasing as it was wound"
edgarallanpoe,"up. It weighed, altogether, eight pounds six ounces. The rudder was"
edgarallanpoe,"a light frame of cane covered with silk, shaped somewhat like a"
edgarallanpoe,"battle-door, and was about three feet long, and at the widest, one foot."
edgarallanpoe,"Its weight was about two ounces. It could be turned _flat_, and directed"
edgarallanpoe,"upwards or downwards, as well as to the right or left; and thus enabled"
edgarallanpoe,the æronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined
edgarallanpoe,"position it must generate in its passage, to any side upon which he"
edgarallanpoe,might desire to act; thus determining the balloon in the opposite
edgarallanpoe,direction.
edgarallanpoe,"“This model (which, through want of time, we have necessarily described"
edgarallanpoe,"in an imperfect manner,) was put in action at the Adelaide Gallery,"
edgarallanpoe,"where it accomplished a velocity of five miles per hour; although,"
edgarallanpoe,"strange to say, it excited very little interest in comparison with the"
edgarallanpoe,previous complex machine of Mr. Henson--so resolute is the world
edgarallanpoe,to despise anything which carries with it an air of simplicity. To
edgarallanpoe,"accomplish the great desideratum of ærial navigation, it was very"
edgarallanpoe,generally supposed that some exceedingly complicated application must be
edgarallanpoe,made of some unusually profound principle in dynamics.
edgarallanpoe,"“So well satisfied, however, was Mr. Mason of the ultimate success of"
edgarallanpoe,"his invention, that he determined to construct immediately, if possible,"
edgarallanpoe,a balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of
edgarallanpoe,"some extent--the original design being to cross the British Channel, as"
edgarallanpoe,"before, in the Nassau balloon. To carry out his views, he solicited and"
edgarallanpoe,"obtained the patronage of Sir Everard Bringhurst and Mr. Osborne, two"
edgarallanpoe,"gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement, and especially for the"
edgarallanpoe,"interest they have exhibited in the progress of ærostation. The project,"
edgarallanpoe,"at the desire of Mr. Osborne, was kept a profound secret from the"
edgarallanpoe,public--the only persons entrusted with the design being those actually
edgarallanpoe,"engaged in the construction of the machine, which was built (under the"
edgarallanpoe,"superintendence of Mr. Mason, Mr. Holland, Sir Everard Bringhurst, and"
edgarallanpoe,"Mr. Osborne,) at the seat of the latter gentleman near Penstruthal, in"
edgarallanpoe,"Wales. Mr. Henson, accompanied by his friend Mr. Ainsworth, was admitted"
edgarallanpoe,"to a private view of the balloon, on Saturday last--when the two"
edgarallanpoe,gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure. We
edgarallanpoe,are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in
edgarallanpoe,"the party--but, in the course of a day or two, we shall put our readers"
edgarallanpoe,in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary
edgarallanpoe,voyage.
edgarallanpoe,"“The balloon is composed of silk, varnished with the liquid gum"
edgarallanpoe,"caoutchouc. It is of vast dimensions, containing more than 40,000 cubic"
edgarallanpoe,feet of gas; but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive
edgarallanpoe,"and inconvenient hydrogen, the supporting power of the machine, when"
edgarallanpoe,"fully inflated, and immediately after inflation, is not more than about"
edgarallanpoe,"2500 pounds. The coal gas is not only much less costly, but is easily"
edgarallanpoe,procured and managed.
edgarallanpoe,"“For its introduction into common use for purposes of aerostation, we"
edgarallanpoe,"are indebted to Mr. Charles Green. Up to his discovery, the process of"
edgarallanpoe,"inflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain. Two, and"
edgarallanpoe,"even three days, have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to"
edgarallanpoe,"procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it"
edgarallanpoe,"had great tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its"
edgarallanpoe,affinity for the surrounding atmosphere. In a balloon sufficiently
edgarallanpoe,"perfect to retain its contents of coal-gas unaltered, in quantity or"
edgarallanpoe,"amount, for six months, an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be"
edgarallanpoe,maintained in equal purity for six weeks.
edgarallanpoe,"“The supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds, and the united"
edgarallanpoe,"weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a"
edgarallanpoe,"surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged"
edgarallanpoe,"in bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon"
edgarallanpoe,"them--by cordage, barometers, telescopes, barrels containing provision"
edgarallanpoe,"for a fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other"
edgarallanpoe,"indispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming"
edgarallanpoe,"coffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire,"
edgarallanpoe,"if it should be judged prudent to do so. All these articles, with the"
edgarallanpoe,"exception of the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the"
edgarallanpoe,"hoop overhead. The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than"
edgarallanpoe,"the one appended to the model. It is formed of a light wicker, and is"
edgarallanpoe,"wonderfully strong, for so frail looking a machine. Its rim is about"
edgarallanpoe,"four feet deep. The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than"
edgarallanpoe,that of the model; and the screw is considerably smaller. The balloon is
edgarallanpoe,"furnished besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope; which latter is of"
edgarallanpoe,"the most indispensable importance. A few words, in explanation, will"
edgarallanpoe,here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the
edgarallanpoe,details of aerostation.
edgarallanpoe,"“As soon as the balloon quits the earth, it is subjected to the"
edgarallanpoe,influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its
edgarallanpoe,"weight; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power. For example,"
edgarallanpoe,"there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk, to the extent, even,"
edgarallanpoe,"of several hundred pounds; ballast has then to be thrown out, or the"
edgarallanpoe,"machine may descend. This ballast being discarded, and a clear sunshine"
edgarallanpoe,"evaporating the dew, and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk,"
edgarallanpoe,"the whole will again rapidly ascend. To check this ascent, the only"
edgarallanpoe,"recourse is, (or rather _was_, until Mr. Green’s invention of the"
edgarallanpoe,"guide-rope,) the permission of the escape of gas from the valve; but, in"
edgarallanpoe,"the loss of gas, is a proportionate general loss of ascending power; so"
edgarallanpoe,"that, in a comparatively brief period, the best-constructed balloon must"
edgarallanpoe,"necessarily exhaust all its resources, and come to the earth. This was"
edgarallanpoe,the great obstacle to voyages of length.
edgarallanpoe,“The guide-rope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner
edgarallanpoe,conceivable. It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail
edgarallanpoe,"from the car, and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from"
edgarallanpoe,"changing its level in any material degree. If, for example, there should"
edgarallanpoe,"be a deposition of moisture upon the silk, and the machine begins to"
edgarallanpoe,"descend in consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging"
edgarallanpoe,"ballast to remedy the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or"
edgarallanpoe,"counteracted, in an exactly just proportion, by the deposit on the"
edgarallanpoe,"ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary. If,"
edgarallanpoe,"on the other hand, any circumstances should cause undue levity, and"
edgarallanpoe,"consequent ascent, this levity is immediately counteracted by the"
edgarallanpoe,"additional weight of rope upraised from the earth. Thus, the balloon"
edgarallanpoe,"can neither ascend or descend, except within very narrow limits, and its"
edgarallanpoe,"resources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively unimpaired."
edgarallanpoe,"When passing over an expanse of water, it becomes necessary to employ"
edgarallanpoe,"small kegs of copper or wood, filled with liquid ballast of a lighter"
edgarallanpoe,"nature than water. These float, and serve all the purposes of a mere"
edgarallanpoe,"rope on land. Another most important office of the guide-rope, is to"
edgarallanpoe,"point out the _direction_ of the balloon. The rope _drags_, either on"
edgarallanpoe,"land or sea, while the balloon is free; the latter, consequently, is"
edgarallanpoe,"always in advance, when any progress whatever is made: a comparison,"
edgarallanpoe,"therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative positions of the two"
edgarallanpoe,"objects, will always indicate the _course_. In the same way, the angle"
edgarallanpoe,"formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine, indicates"
edgarallanpoe,"the _velocity_. When there is _no_ angle--in other words, when the rope"
edgarallanpoe,"hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger"
edgarallanpoe,"the angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of"
edgarallanpoe,"the rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse."
edgarallanpoe,"“As the original design was to cross the British Channel, and alight as"
edgarallanpoe,"near Paris as possible, the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare"
edgarallanpoe,"themselves with passports directed to all parts of the Continent,"
edgarallanpoe,"specifying the nature of the expedition, as in the case of the Nassau"
edgarallanpoe,"voyage, and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual"
edgarallanpoe,"formalities of office: unexpected events, however, rendered these"
edgarallanpoe,passports superfluous.
edgarallanpoe,"“The inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak, on Saturday"
edgarallanpoe,"morning, the 6th instant, in the Court-Yard of Weal-Vor House, Mr."
edgarallanpoe,"Osborne’s seat, about a mile from Penstruthal, in North Wales; and at 7"
edgarallanpoe,"minutes past 11, every thing being ready for departure, the balloon was"
edgarallanpoe,"set free, rising gently but steadily, in a direction nearly South; no"
edgarallanpoe,"use being made, for the first half hour, of either the screw or the"
edgarallanpoe,"rudder. We proceed now with the journal, as transcribed by Mr. Forsyth"
edgarallanpoe,"from the joint MSS. Of Mr. Monck Mason, and Mr. Ainsworth. The body of"
edgarallanpoe,"the journal, as given, is in the hand-writing of Mr. Mason, and a P."
edgarallanpoe,"S. is appended, each day, by Mr. Ainsworth, who has in preparation, and"
edgarallanpoe,"will shortly give the public a more minute, and no doubt, a thrillingly"
edgarallanpoe,interesting account of the voyage.
edgarallanpoe,“THE JOURNAL.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Saturday, April the 6th_.--Every preparation likely to embarrass us,"
edgarallanpoe,"having been made over night, we commenced the inflation this morning at"
edgarallanpoe,"daybreak; but owing to a thick fog, which encumbered the folds of the"
edgarallanpoe,"silk and rendered it unmanageable, we did not get through before nearly"
edgarallanpoe,"eleven o’clock. Cut loose, then, in high spirits, and rose gently but"
edgarallanpoe,"steadily, with a light breeze at North, which bore us in the direction"
edgarallanpoe,of the British Channel. Found the ascending force greater than we had
edgarallanpoe,"expected; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs, and"
edgarallanpoe,"more in the sun’s rays, our ascent became very rapid. I did not wish,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure, and so"
edgarallanpoe,concluded to ascend for the present. We soon ran out our guide-rope;
edgarallanpoe,"but even when we had raised it clear of the earth, we still went up very"
edgarallanpoe,"rapidly. The balloon was unusually steady, and looked beautifully. In"
edgarallanpoe,"about ten minutes after starting, the barometer indicated an altitude"
edgarallanpoe,"of 15,000 feet. The weather was remarkably fine, and the view of the"
edgarallanpoe,"subjacent country--a most romantic one when seen from any point,--was"
edgarallanpoe,now especially sublime. The numerous deep gorges presented the
edgarallanpoe,"appearance of lakes, on account of the dense vapors with which they"
edgarallanpoe,"were filled, and the pinnacles and crags to the South East, piled in"
edgarallanpoe,"inextricable confusion, resembling nothing so much as the giant cities"
edgarallanpoe,of eastern fable. We were rapidly approaching the mountains in the
edgarallanpoe,South; but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass
edgarallanpoe,them in safety. In a few minutes we soared over them in fine style; and
edgarallanpoe,"Mr. Ainsworth, with the seamen, was surprised at their apparent want of"
edgarallanpoe,"altitude when viewed from the car, the tendency of great elevation in a"
edgarallanpoe,"balloon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below, to nearly"
edgarallanpoe,"a dead level. At half-past eleven still proceeding nearly South, we"
edgarallanpoe,"obtained our first view of the Bristol Channel; and, in fifteen minutes"
edgarallanpoe,"afterward, the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately"
edgarallanpoe,"beneath us, and we were fairly out at sea. We now resolved to let off"
edgarallanpoe,"enough gas to bring our guide-rope, with the buoys affixed, into the"
edgarallanpoe,"water. This was immediately done, and we commenced a gradual descent."
edgarallanpoe,"In about twenty minutes our first buoy dipped, and at the touch of the"
edgarallanpoe,"second soon afterwards, we remained stationary as to elevation. We were"
edgarallanpoe,"all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw, and we"
edgarallanpoe,"put them both into requisition forthwith, for the purpose of altering"
edgarallanpoe,"our direction more to the eastward, and in a line for Paris. By means of"
edgarallanpoe,"the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction, and"
edgarallanpoe,our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind; when
edgarallanpoe,"we set in motion the spring of the screw, and were rejoiced to find it"
edgarallanpoe,"propel us readily as desired. Upon this we gave nine hearty cheers, and"
edgarallanpoe,"dropped in the sea a bottle, enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief"
edgarallanpoe,"account of the principle of the invention. Hardly, however, had we"
edgarallanpoe,"done with our rejoicings, when an unforeseen accident occurred which"
edgarallanpoe,discouraged us in no little degree. The steel rod connecting the spring
edgarallanpoe,"with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place, at the car end, (by"
edgarallanpoe,a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we
edgarallanpoe,"had taken up,) and in an instant hung dangling out of reach, from the"
edgarallanpoe,"pivot of the axis of the screw. While we were endeavoring to regain it,"
edgarallanpoe,"our attention being completely absorbed, we became involved in a strong"
edgarallanpoe,"current of wind from the East, which bore us, with rapidly increasing"
edgarallanpoe,"force, towards the Atlantic. We soon found ourselves driving out to sea"
edgarallanpoe,"at the rate of not less, certainly, than fifty or sixty miles an hour,"
edgarallanpoe,"so that we came up with Cape Clear, at some forty miles to our North,"
edgarallanpoe,"before we had secured the rod, and had time to think what we were about."
edgarallanpoe,"It was now that Mr. Ainsworth made an extraordinary, but to my fancy,"
edgarallanpoe,"a by no means unreasonable or chimerical proposition, in which he was"
edgarallanpoe,instantly seconded by Mr. Holland--viz.: that we should take advantage
edgarallanpoe,"of the strong gale which bore us on, and in place of beating back to"
edgarallanpoe,"Paris, make an attempt to reach the coast of North America. After slight"
edgarallanpoe,"reflection I gave a willing assent to this bold proposition, which"
edgarallanpoe,(strange to say) met with objection from the two seamen only. As the
edgarallanpoe,"stronger party, however, we overruled their fears, and kept resolutely"
edgarallanpoe,upon our course. We steered due West; but as the trailing of the buoys
edgarallanpoe,"materially impeded our progress, and we had the balloon abundantly at"
edgarallanpoe,"command, either for ascent or descent, we first threw out fifty pounds"
edgarallanpoe,"of ballast, and then wound up (by means of a windlass) so much of the"
edgarallanpoe,rope as brought it quite clear of the sea. We perceived the effect of
edgarallanpoe,"this manoeuvre immediately, in a vastly increased rate of progress; and,"
edgarallanpoe,"as the gale freshened, we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable; the"
edgarallanpoe,"guide-rope flying out behind the car, like a streamer from a vessel. It"
edgarallanpoe,is needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of
edgarallanpoe,"the coast. We passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds, a few of"
edgarallanpoe,"which were endeavoring to beat up, but the most of them lying to. We"
edgarallanpoe,occasioned the greatest excitement on board all--an excitement greatly
edgarallanpoe,"relished by ourselves, and especially by our two men, who, now under the"
edgarallanpoe,"influence of a dram of Geneva, seemed resolved to give all scruple, or"
edgarallanpoe,"fear, to the wind. Many of the vessels fired signal guns; and in all"
edgarallanpoe,we were saluted with loud cheers (which we heard with surprising
edgarallanpoe,distinctness) and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs. We kept on in
edgarallanpoe,"this manner throughout the day, with no material incident, and, as"
edgarallanpoe,"the shades of night closed around us, we made a rough estimate of the"
edgarallanpoe,distance traversed. It could not have been less than five hundred
edgarallanpoe,"miles, and was probably much more. The propeller was kept in constant"
edgarallanpoe,"operation, and, no doubt, aided our progress materially. As the sun"
edgarallanpoe,"went down, the gale freshened into an absolute hurricane, and the ocean"
edgarallanpoe,beneath was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence. The wind
edgarallanpoe,"was from the East all night, and gave us the brightest omen of success."
edgarallanpoe,"We suffered no little from cold, and the dampness of the atmosphere was"
edgarallanpoe,"most unpleasant; but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down,"
edgarallanpoe,"and by means of cloaks and a few blankets, we did sufficiently well."
edgarallanpoe,“P.S. (by Mr. Ainsworth.) The last nine hours have been unquestionably
edgarallanpoe,the most exciting of my life. I can conceive nothing more sublimating
edgarallanpoe,than the strange peril and novelty of an adventure such as this. May
edgarallanpoe,God grant that we succeed! I ask not success for mere safety to my
edgarallanpoe,"insignificant person, but for the sake of human knowledge and--for the"
edgarallanpoe,vastness of the triumph. And yet the feat is only so evidently feasible
edgarallanpoe,that the sole wonder is why men have scrupled to attempt it before. One
edgarallanpoe,single gale such as now befriends us--let such a tempest whirl forward
edgarallanpoe,a balloon for four or five days (these gales often last longer) and the
edgarallanpoe,"voyager will be easily borne, in that period, from coast to coast. In"
edgarallanpoe,view of such a gale the broad Atlantic becomes a mere lake. I am more
edgarallanpoe,"struck, just now, with the supreme silence which reigns in the"
edgarallanpoe,"sea beneath us, notwithstanding its agitation, than with any other"
edgarallanpoe,phenomenon presenting itself. The waters give up no voice to
edgarallanpoe,the heavens. The immense flaming ocean writhes and is tortured
edgarallanpoe,uncomplainingly. The mountainous surges suggest the idea of innumerable
edgarallanpoe,dumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony. In a night such as is
edgarallanpoe,"this to me, a man _lives_--lives a whole century of ordinary life--nor"
edgarallanpoe,would I forego this rapturous delight for that of a whole century of
edgarallanpoe,ordinary existence.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Sunday, the seventh_. [Mr. Mason’s MS.] This morning the gale, by 10,"
edgarallanpoe,"had subsided to an eight or nine--knot breeze, (for a vessel at sea,)"
edgarallanpoe,"and bears us, perhaps, thirty miles per hour, or more. It has veered,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, very considerably to the north; and now, at sundown, we are"
edgarallanpoe,"holding our course due west, principally by the screw and rudder, which"
edgarallanpoe,answer their purposes to admiration. I regard the project as thoroughly
edgarallanpoe,"successful, and the easy navigation of the air in any direction (not"
edgarallanpoe,exactly in the teeth of a gale) as no longer problematical. We could not
edgarallanpoe,"have made head against the strong wind of yesterday; but, by ascending,"
edgarallanpoe,"we might have got out of its influence, if requisite. Against a pretty"
edgarallanpoe,"stiff breeze, I feel convinced, we can make our way with the propeller."
edgarallanpoe,"At noon, to-day, ascended to an elevation of nearly 25,000 feet, by"
edgarallanpoe,"discharging ballast. Did this to search for a more direct current, but"
edgarallanpoe,found none so favorable as the one we are now in. We have an abundance
edgarallanpoe,"of gas to take us across this small pond, even should the voyage"
edgarallanpoe,last three weeks. I have not the slightest fear for the result. The
edgarallanpoe,difficulty has been strangely exaggerated and misapprehended. I can
edgarallanpoe,"choose my current, and should I find _all_ currents against me, I can"
edgarallanpoe,make very tolerable headway with the propeller. We have had no incidents
edgarallanpoe,worth recording. The night promises fair.
edgarallanpoe,"P.S. [By Mr. Ainsworth.] I have little to record, except the fact (to me"
edgarallanpoe,"quite a surprising one) that, at an elevation equal to that of Cotopaxi,"
edgarallanpoe,"I experienced neither very intense cold, nor headache, nor difficulty"
edgarallanpoe,"of breathing; neither, I find, did Mr. Mason, nor Mr. Holland, nor Sir"
edgarallanpoe,Everard. Mr. Osborne complained of constriction of the chest--but this
edgarallanpoe,"soon wore off. We have flown at a great rate during the day, and we"
edgarallanpoe,must be more than half way across the Atlantic. We have passed over
edgarallanpoe,"some twenty or thirty vessels of various kinds, and all seem to be"
edgarallanpoe,delightfully astonished. Crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so
edgarallanpoe,difficult a feat after all. _Omne ignotum pro magnifico. Mem:_ at
edgarallanpoe,"25,000 feet elevation the sky appears nearly black, and the stars are"
edgarallanpoe,distinctly visible; while the sea does not seem convex (as one might
edgarallanpoe,suppose) but absolutely and most unequivocally _concave_.(*1)
edgarallanpoe,"“_Monday, the 8th_. [Mr. Mason’s MS.] This morning we had again some"
edgarallanpoe,"little trouble with the rod of the propeller, which must be entirely"
edgarallanpoe,"remodelled, for fear of serious accident--I mean the steel rod--not"
edgarallanpoe,the vanes. The latter could not be improved. The wind has been blowing
edgarallanpoe,steadily and strongly from the north-east all day and so far fortune
edgarallanpoe,"seems bent upon favoring us. Just before day, we were all somewhat"
edgarallanpoe,"alarmed at some odd noises and concussions in the balloon, accompanied"
edgarallanpoe,with the apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine. These phenomena
edgarallanpoe,"were occasioned by the expansion of the gas, through increase of heat in"
edgarallanpoe,"the atmosphere, and the consequent disruption of the minute particles of"
edgarallanpoe,ice with which the network had become encrusted during the night. Threw
edgarallanpoe,down several bottles to the vessels below. Saw one of them picked up by
edgarallanpoe,a large ship--seemingly one of the New York line packets. Endeavored to
edgarallanpoe,"make out her name, but could not be sure of it. Mr. Osborne’s telescope"
edgarallanpoe,"made it out something like “Atalanta.” It is now 12, at night, and we"
edgarallanpoe,"are still going nearly west, at a rapid pace. The sea is peculiarly"
edgarallanpoe,phosphorescent.
edgarallanpoe,"“P.S. [By Mr. Ainsworth.] It is now 2, A.M., and nearly calm, as well as"
edgarallanpoe,"I can judge--but it is very difficult to determine this point, since"
edgarallanpoe,we move _with_ the air so completely. I have not slept since quitting
edgarallanpoe,"Wheal-Vor, but can stand it no longer, and must take a nap. We cannot be"
edgarallanpoe,far from the American coast.
edgarallanpoe,"“_Tuesday, the _9_th_. [Mr. Ainsworth’s MS.] _One, P.M. We are in"
edgarallanpoe,full view of the low coast of South Carolina_. The great problem is
edgarallanpoe,accomplished. We have crossed the Atlantic--fairly and _easily_
edgarallanpoe,crossed it in a balloon! God be praised! Who shall say that anything is
edgarallanpoe,impossible hereafter?”
edgarallanpoe,The Journal here ceases. Some particulars of the descent were
edgarallanpoe,"communicated, however, by Mr. Ainsworth to Mr. Forsyth. It was nearly"
edgarallanpoe,"dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast, which"
edgarallanpoe,"was immediately recognized by both the seamen, and by Mr. Osborne."
edgarallanpoe,"The latter gentleman having acquaintances at Fort Moultrie, it was"
edgarallanpoe,immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity. The balloon was brought
edgarallanpoe,"over the beach (the tide being out and the sand hard, smooth, and"
edgarallanpoe,"admirably adapted for a descent,) and the grapnel let go, which took"
edgarallanpoe,"firm hold at once. The inhabitants of the island, and of the fort,"
edgarallanpoe,"thronged out, of course, to see the balloon; but it was with the"
edgarallanpoe,greatest difficulty that any one could be made to credit the actual
edgarallanpoe,"voyage--_the crossing of the Atlantic_. The grapnel caught at 2, P.M.,"
edgarallanpoe,precisely; and thus the whole voyage was completed in seventy-five
edgarallanpoe,"hours; or rather less, counting from shore to shore. No serious accident"
edgarallanpoe,occurred. No real danger was at any time apprehended. The balloon was
edgarallanpoe,exhausted and secured without trouble; and when the MS.  from which this
edgarallanpoe,"narrative is compiled was despatched from Charleston, the party were"
edgarallanpoe,still at Fort Moultrie. Their farther intentions were not ascertained;
edgarallanpoe,but we can safely promise our readers some additional information either
edgarallanpoe,"on Monday or in the course of the next day, at farthest."
edgarallanpoe,"This is unquestionably the most stupendous, the most interesting, and"
edgarallanpoe,"the most important undertaking, ever accomplished or even attempted by"
edgarallanpoe,"man. What magnificent events may ensue, it would be useless now to think"
edgarallanpoe,of determining.
edgarallanpoe,(*1) _Note_.--Mr. Ainsworth has not attempted to account for this
edgarallanpoe,"phenomenon, which, however, is quite susceptible of explanation. A line"
edgarallanpoe,"dropped from an elevation of 25,000 feet, perpendicularly to the surface"
edgarallanpoe,"of the earth (or sea), would form the perpendicular of a right-angled"
edgarallanpoe,"triangle, of which the base would extend from the right angle to the"
edgarallanpoe,"horizon, and the hypothenuse from the horizon to the balloon. But the"
edgarallanpoe,"25,000 feet of altitude is little or nothing, in comparison with the"
edgarallanpoe,"extent of the prospect. In other words, the base and hypothenuse of the"
edgarallanpoe,"supposed triangle would be so long when compared with the perpendicular,"
edgarallanpoe,that the two former may be regarded as nearly parallel. In this manner
edgarallanpoe,the horizon of the æronaut would appear to be _on a level_ with the
edgarallanpoe,"car. But, as the point immediately beneath him seems, and is, at a great"
edgarallanpoe,"distance below him, it seems, of course, also, at a great distance below"
edgarallanpoe,the horizon. Hence the impression of _concavity_; and this impression
edgarallanpoe,"must remain, until the elevation shall bear so great a proportion to"
edgarallanpoe,"the extent of prospect, that the apparent parallelism of the base and"
edgarallanpoe,hypothenuse disappears--when the earth’s real convexity must become
edgarallanpoe,apparent.

edgarallanpoe,--Quinault--Atys.
edgarallanpoe,OF my country and of my family I have little to say. Ill usage and
edgarallanpoe,"length of years have driven me from the one, and estranged me from the"
edgarallanpoe,"other. Hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order,"
edgarallanpoe,and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the stores
edgarallanpoe,"which early study very diligently garnered up.--Beyond all things,"
edgarallanpoe,the study of the German moralists gave me great delight; not from any
edgarallanpoe,"ill-advised admiration of their eloquent madness, but from the ease with"
edgarallanpoe,which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities.
edgarallanpoe,I have often been reproached with the aridity of my genius; a deficiency
edgarallanpoe,of imagination has been imputed to me as a crime; and the Pyrrhonism
edgarallanpoe,"of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious. Indeed, a strong"
edgarallanpoe,"relish for physical philosophy has, I fear, tinctured my mind with"
edgarallanpoe,a very common error of this age--I mean the habit of referring
edgarallanpoe,"occurrences, even the least susceptible of such reference, to the"
edgarallanpoe,"principles of that science. Upon the whole, no person could be less"
edgarallanpoe,liable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by
edgarallanpoe,the ignes fatui of superstition. I have thought proper to premise thus
edgarallanpoe,"much, lest the incredible tale I have to tell should be considered"
edgarallanpoe,"rather the raving of a crude imagination, than the positive experience"
edgarallanpoe,of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a
edgarallanpoe,nullity.
edgarallanpoe,"After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in the year 18-- ,"
edgarallanpoe,"from the port of Batavia, in the rich and populous island of Java, on"
edgarallanpoe,a voyage to the Archipelago of the Sunda islands. I went as
edgarallanpoe,passenger--having no other inducement than a kind of nervous
edgarallanpoe,restlessness which haunted me as a fiend.
edgarallanpoe,"Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons,"
edgarallanpoe,"copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak. She was freighted"
edgarallanpoe,"with cotton-wool and oil, from the Lachadive islands. We had also on"
edgarallanpoe,"board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of opium. The"
edgarallanpoe,"stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently crank."
edgarallanpoe,"We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and for many days stood"
edgarallanpoe,"along the eastern coast of Java, without any other incident to beguile"
edgarallanpoe,the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the
edgarallanpoe,small grabs of the Archipelago to which we were bound.
edgarallanpoe,"One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very singular,"
edgarallanpoe,"isolated cloud, to the N.W. It was remarkable, as well for its color, as"
edgarallanpoe,from its being the first we had seen since our departure from Batavia.
edgarallanpoe,"I watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once to"
edgarallanpoe,"the eastward and westward, girting in the horizon with a narrow strip"
edgarallanpoe,"of vapor, and looking like a long line of low beach. My notice was soon"
edgarallanpoe,"afterwards attracted by the dusky-red appearance of the moon, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"peculiar character of the sea. The latter was undergoing a rapid change,"
edgarallanpoe,and the water seemed more than usually transparent. Although I could
edgarallanpoe,"distinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in"
edgarallanpoe,"fifteen fathoms. The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with"
edgarallanpoe,spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heat iron. As night
edgarallanpoe,"came on, every breath of wind died away, an more entire calm it is"
edgarallanpoe,impossible to conceive. The flame of a candle burned upon the poop
edgarallanpoe,"without the least perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between the"
edgarallanpoe,"finger and thumb, hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration."
edgarallanpoe,"However, as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger,"
edgarallanpoe,"and as we were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to"
edgarallanpoe,"be furled, and the anchor let go. No watch was set, and the crew,"
edgarallanpoe,"consisting principally of Malays, stretched themselves deliberately upon"
edgarallanpoe,"deck. I went below--not without a full presentiment of evil. Indeed,"
edgarallanpoe,every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom. I told the
edgarallanpoe,"captain my fears; but he paid no attention to what I said, and left me"
edgarallanpoe,"without deigning to give a reply. My uneasiness, however, prevented me"
edgarallanpoe,"from sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck.--As I placed my foot"
edgarallanpoe,"upon the upper step of the companion-ladder, I was startled by a"
edgarallanpoe,"loud, humming noise, like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a"
edgarallanpoe,"mill-wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the ship"
edgarallanpoe,"quivering to its centre. In the next instant, a wilderness of foam"
edgarallanpoe,"hurled us upon our beam-ends, and, rushing over us fore and aft, swept"
edgarallanpoe,the entire decks from stem to stern.
edgarallanpoe,"The extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great measure, the salvation"
edgarallanpoe,"of the ship. Although completely water-logged, yet, as her masts had"
edgarallanpoe,"gone by the board, she rose, after a minute, heavily from the sea, and,"
edgarallanpoe,"staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest, finally"
edgarallanpoe,righted.
edgarallanpoe,"By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say. Stunned"
edgarallanpoe,"by the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery, jammed in"
edgarallanpoe,between the stern-post and rudder. With great difficulty I gained my
edgarallanpoe,"feet, and looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck with the idea of"
edgarallanpoe,"our being among breakers; so terrific, beyond the wildest imagination,"
edgarallanpoe,was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were
edgarallanpoe,"engulfed. After a while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had"
edgarallanpoe,shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port. I hallooed to
edgarallanpoe,"him with all my strength, and presently he came reeling aft. We soon"
edgarallanpoe,"discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident. All on deck,"
edgarallanpoe,"with the exception of ourselves, had been swept overboard;--the captain"
edgarallanpoe,"and mates must have perished as they slept, for the cabins were deluged"
edgarallanpoe,"with water. Without assistance, we could expect to do little for the"
edgarallanpoe,"security of the ship, and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the"
edgarallanpoe,"momentary expectation of going down. Our cable had, of course, parted"
edgarallanpoe,"like pack-thread, at the first breath of the hurricane, or we should"
edgarallanpoe,have been instantaneously overwhelmed. We scudded with frightful
edgarallanpoe,"velocity before the sea, and the water made clear breaches over us. The"
edgarallanpoe,"frame-work of our stern was shattered excessively, and, in almost every"
edgarallanpoe,"respect, we had received considerable injury; but to our extreme Joy we"
edgarallanpoe,"found the pumps unchoked, and that we had made no great shifting of"
edgarallanpoe,"our ballast. The main fury of the blast had already blown over, and we"
edgarallanpoe,apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind; but we looked
edgarallanpoe,"forward to its total cessation with dismay; well believing, that, in our"
edgarallanpoe,"shattered condition, we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell"
edgarallanpoe,which would ensue. But this very just apprehension seemed by no means
edgarallanpoe,likely to be soon verified. For five entire days and nights--during
edgarallanpoe,"which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured"
edgarallanpoe,with great difficulty from the forecastle--the hulk flew at a rate
edgarallanpoe,"defying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind, which,"
edgarallanpoe,"without equalling the first violence of the Simoom, were still more"
edgarallanpoe,terrific than any tempest I had before encountered. Our course for the
edgarallanpoe,"first four days was, with trifling variations, S.E. and by S.; and we"
edgarallanpoe,must have run down the coast of New Holland.--On the fifth day the cold
edgarallanpoe,"became extreme, although the wind had hauled round a point more to the"
edgarallanpoe,"northward.--The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and clambered a"
edgarallanpoe,very few degrees above the horizon--emitting no decisive light.--There
edgarallanpoe,"were no clouds apparent, yet the wind was upon the increase, and blew"
edgarallanpoe,"with a fitful and unsteady fury. About noon, as nearly as we could"
edgarallanpoe,"guess, our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun."
edgarallanpoe,"It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull and sullen glow"
edgarallanpoe,"without reflection, as if all its rays were polarized. Just before"
edgarallanpoe,"sinking within the turgid sea, its central fires suddenly went out, as"
edgarallanpoe,"if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power. It was a dim,"
edgarallanpoe,"sliver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean."
edgarallanpoe,We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day--that day to me
edgarallanpoe,"has not arrived--to the Swede, never did arrive. Thenceforward we were"
edgarallanpoe,"enshrouded in patchy darkness, so that we could not have seen an object"
edgarallanpoe,"at twenty paces from the ship. Eternal night continued to envelop us,"
edgarallanpoe,all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to which we had been
edgarallanpoe,"accustomed in the tropics. We observed too, that, although the tempest"
edgarallanpoe,"continued to rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be"
edgarallanpoe,"discovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which had hitherto"
edgarallanpoe,"attended us. All around were horror, and thick gloom, and a black"
edgarallanpoe,sweltering desert of ebony.--Superstitious terror crept by degrees into
edgarallanpoe,"the spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent"
edgarallanpoe,"wonder. We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and"
edgarallanpoe,"securing ourselves, as well as possible, to the stump of the mizen-mast,"
edgarallanpoe,looked out bitterly into the world of ocean. We had no means of
edgarallanpoe,"calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation. We were,"
edgarallanpoe,"however, well aware of having made farther to the southward than any"
edgarallanpoe,"previous navigators, and felt great amazement at not meeting with the"
edgarallanpoe,usual impediments of ice. In the meantime every moment threatened to be
edgarallanpoe,our last--every mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us. The swell
edgarallanpoe,"surpassed anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not"
edgarallanpoe,instantly buried is a miracle. My companion spoke of the lightness of
edgarallanpoe,"our cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship; but"
edgarallanpoe,"I could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and"
edgarallanpoe,prepared myself gloomily for that death which I thought nothing could
edgarallanpoe,"defer beyond an hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made,"
edgarallanpoe,the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally
edgarallanpoe,appalling. At times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the
edgarallanpoe,albatross--at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into
edgarallanpoe,"some watery hell, where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed"
edgarallanpoe,the slumbers of the kraken.
edgarallanpoe,"We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick scream"
edgarallanpoe,"from my companion broke fearfully upon the night. “See! see!” cried he,"
edgarallanpoe,"shrieking in my ears, “Almighty God! see! see!” As he spoke, I became"
edgarallanpoe,"aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides"
edgarallanpoe,"of the vast chasm where we lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our"
edgarallanpoe,"deck. Casting my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the"
edgarallanpoe,"current of my blood. At a terrific height directly above us, and upon"
edgarallanpoe,"the very verge of the precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of,"
edgarallanpoe,"perhaps, four thousand tons. Although upreared upon the summit of a wave"
edgarallanpoe,"more than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent size exceeded"
edgarallanpoe,that of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence. Her huge
edgarallanpoe,"hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary"
edgarallanpoe,carvings of a ship. A single row of brass cannon protruded from her open
edgarallanpoe,"ports, and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable"
edgarallanpoe,"battle-lanterns, which swung to and fro about her rigging. But what"
edgarallanpoe,"mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up"
edgarallanpoe,"under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of"
edgarallanpoe,"that ungovernable hurricane. When we first discovered her, her bows"
edgarallanpoe,"were alone to be seen, as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf"
edgarallanpoe,beyond her. For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy
edgarallanpoe,"pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own sublimity, then trembled and"
edgarallanpoe,"tottered, and--came down."
edgarallanpoe,"At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession came over my"
edgarallanpoe,"spirit. Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited fearlessly the ruin"
edgarallanpoe,that was to overwhelm. Our own vessel was at length ceasing from her
edgarallanpoe,"struggles, and sinking with her head to the sea. The shock of the"
edgarallanpoe,"descending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion of her frame"
edgarallanpoe,"which was already under water, and the inevitable result was to hurl me,"
edgarallanpoe,"with irresistible violence, upon the rigging of the stranger."
edgarallanpoe,"As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to the confusion"
edgarallanpoe,ensuing I attributed my escape from the notice of the crew. With little
edgarallanpoe,"difficulty I made my way unperceived to the main hatchway, which was"
edgarallanpoe,"partially open, and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the"
edgarallanpoe,"hold. Why I did so I can hardly tell. An indefinite sense of awe, which"
edgarallanpoe,"at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind,"
edgarallanpoe,was perhaps the principle of my concealment. I was unwilling to trust
edgarallanpoe,"myself with a race of people who had offered, to the cursory glance I"
edgarallanpoe,"had taken, so many points of vague novelty, doubt, and apprehension. I"
edgarallanpoe,therefore thought proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold. This I
edgarallanpoe,"did by removing a small portion of the shifting-boards, in such a manner"
edgarallanpoe,as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the
edgarallanpoe,ship.
edgarallanpoe,"I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold forced me"
edgarallanpoe,to make use of it. A man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble
edgarallanpoe,"and unsteady gait. I could not see his face, but had an opportunity"
edgarallanpoe,of observing his general appearance. There was about it an evidence of
edgarallanpoe,"great age and infirmity. His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and"
edgarallanpoe,"his entire frame quivered under the burthen. He muttered to himself,"
edgarallanpoe,"in a low broken tone, some words of a language which I could not"
edgarallanpoe,"understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of singular-looking"
edgarallanpoe,"instruments, and decayed charts of navigation. His manner was a wild"
edgarallanpoe,"mixture of the peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity"
edgarallanpoe,"of a God. He at length went on deck, and I saw him no more."
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,"A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul"
edgarallanpoe,"--a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the lessons of"
edgarallanpoe,"bygone times are inadequate, and for which I fear futurity itself"
edgarallanpoe,"will offer me no key. To a mind constituted like my own, the latter"
edgarallanpoe,consideration is an evil. I shall never--I know that I shall
edgarallanpoe,never--be satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions. Yet it
edgarallanpoe,"is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have"
edgarallanpoe,their origin in sources so utterly novel. A new sense--a new entity is
edgarallanpoe,added to my soul.

edgarallanpoe,"It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship, and the"
edgarallanpoe,"rays of my destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus. Incomprehensible"
edgarallanpoe,"men! Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I cannot divine, they"
edgarallanpoe,"pass me by unnoticed. Concealment is utter folly on my part, for the"
edgarallanpoe,people will not see. It was but just now that I passed directly before
edgarallanpoe,the eyes of the mate--it was no long while ago that I ventured into the
edgarallanpoe,"captain’s own private cabin, and took thence the materials with which"
edgarallanpoe,"I write, and have written. I shall from time to time continue this"
edgarallanpoe,Journal. It is true that I may not find an opportunity of transmitting
edgarallanpoe,"it to the world, but I will not fall to make the endeavour. At the last"
edgarallanpoe,"moment I will enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the sea."
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,An incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation. Are
edgarallanpoe,such things the operation of ungoverned Chance? I had ventured upon deck
edgarallanpoe,"and thrown myself down, without attracting any notice, among a pile of"
edgarallanpoe,ratlin-stuff and old sails in the bottom of the yawl. While musing upon
edgarallanpoe,"the singularity of my fate, I unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the"
edgarallanpoe,edges of a neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a barrel.
edgarallanpoe,"The studding-sail is now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless touches"
edgarallanpoe,of the brush are spread out into the word DISCOVERY.
edgarallanpoe,I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel.
edgarallanpoe,"Although well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war. Her rigging,"
edgarallanpoe,"build, and general equipment, all negative a supposition of this"
edgarallanpoe,"kind. What she is not, I can easily perceive--what she is I fear it is"
edgarallanpoe,"impossible to say. I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange"
edgarallanpoe,"model and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits"
edgarallanpoe,"of canvas, her severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will"
edgarallanpoe,"occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and"
edgarallanpoe,"there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection,"
edgarallanpoe,an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,I have been looking at the timbers of the ship. She is built of a
edgarallanpoe,material to which I am a stranger. There is a peculiar character about
edgarallanpoe,the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to
edgarallanpoe,"which it has been applied. I mean its extreme porousness, considered"
edgarallanpoe,independently by the worm-eaten condition which is a consequence of
edgarallanpoe,"navigation in these seas, and apart from the rottenness attendant upon"
edgarallanpoe,"age. It will appear perhaps an observation somewhat over-curious, but"
edgarallanpoe,"this wood would have every characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak"
edgarallanpoe,were distended by any unnatural means.
edgarallanpoe,In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old
edgarallanpoe,weather-beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection. “It
edgarallanpoe,"is as sure,” he was wont to say, when any doubt was entertained of his"
edgarallanpoe,"veracity, “as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in"
edgarallanpoe,bulk like the living body of the seaman.”
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,"About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of the"
edgarallanpoe,"crew. They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I stood in the"
edgarallanpoe,"very midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious of my presence. Like"
edgarallanpoe,"the one I had at first seen in the hold, they all bore about them the"
edgarallanpoe,marks of a hoary old age. Their knees trembled with infirmity; their
edgarallanpoe,shoulders were bent double with decrepitude; their shrivelled skins
edgarallanpoe,"rattled in the wind; their voices were low, tremulous and broken; their"
edgarallanpoe,eyes glistened with the rheum of years; and their gray hairs streamed
edgarallanpoe,"terribly in the tempest. Around them, on every part of the deck, lay"
edgarallanpoe,scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete
edgarallanpoe,construction.
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding-sail. From that
edgarallanpoe,"period the ship, being thrown dead off the wind, has continued her"
edgarallanpoe,"terrific course due south, with every rag of canvas packed upon her,"
edgarallanpoe,"from her trucks to her lower studding-sail booms, and rolling every"
edgarallanpoe,moment her top-gallant yard-arms into the most appalling hell of water
edgarallanpoe,which it can enter into the mind of a man to imagine. I have just left
edgarallanpoe,"the deck, where I find it impossible to maintain a footing, although the"
edgarallanpoe,crew seem to experience little inconvenience. It appears to me a miracle
edgarallanpoe,of miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and
edgarallanpoe,forever. We are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of
edgarallanpoe,"Eternity, without taking a final plunge into the abyss. From billows a"
edgarallanpoe,"thousand times more stupendous than any I have ever seen, we glide away"
edgarallanpoe,with the facility of the arrowy sea-gull; and the colossal waters rear
edgarallanpoe,"their heads above us like demons of the deep, but like demons confined"
edgarallanpoe,to simple threats and forbidden to destroy. I am led to attribute these
edgarallanpoe,frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such
edgarallanpoe,effect.--I must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some
edgarallanpoe,"strong current, or impetuous under-tow."
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,"I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own cabin--but, as I"
edgarallanpoe,"expected, he paid me no attention. Although in his appearance there is,"
edgarallanpoe,"to a casual observer, nothing which might bespeak him more or less than"
edgarallanpoe,man--still a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the
edgarallanpoe,sensation of wonder with which I regarded him. In stature he is nearly
edgarallanpoe,"my own height; that is, about five feet eight inches. He is of a"
edgarallanpoe,"well-knit and compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkably"
edgarallanpoe,otherwise. But it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon
edgarallanpoe,"the face--it is the intense, the wonderful, the thrilling evidence of"
edgarallanpoe,"old age, so utter, so extreme, which excites within my spirit a sense--a"
edgarallanpoe,"sentiment ineffable. His forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to"
edgarallanpoe,bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years.--His gray hairs are records
edgarallanpoe,"of the past, and his grayer eyes are Sybils of the future. The cabin"
edgarallanpoe,"floor was thickly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and"
edgarallanpoe,"mouldering instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten charts."
edgarallanpoe,"His head was bowed down upon his hands, and he pored, with a fiery"
edgarallanpoe,"unquiet eye, over a paper which I took to be a commission, and which, at"
edgarallanpoe,"all events, bore the signature of a monarch. He muttered to himself, as"
edgarallanpoe,"did the first seaman whom I saw in the hold, some low peevish syllables"
edgarallanpoe,"of a foreign tongue, and although the speaker was close at my elbow, his"
edgarallanpoe,voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile.
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld. The crew glide
edgarallanpoe,to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries; their eyes have an eager
edgarallanpoe,and uneasy meaning; and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the
edgarallanpoe,"wild glare of the battle-lanterns, I feel as I have never felt before,"
edgarallanpoe,"although I have been all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have"
edgarallanpoe,"imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at Balbec, and Tadmor, and"
edgarallanpoe,"Persepolis, until my very soul has become a ruin."
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions. If I
edgarallanpoe,"trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I not stand"
edgarallanpoe,"aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which"
edgarallanpoe,the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective? All in the
edgarallanpoe,"immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a"
edgarallanpoe,"chaos of foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may"
edgarallanpoe,"be seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice,"
edgarallanpoe,"towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the"
edgarallanpoe,universe.
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,"As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if that appellation"
edgarallanpoe,"can properly be given to a tide which, howling and shrieking by the"
edgarallanpoe,"white ice, thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the"
edgarallanpoe,headlong dashing of a cataract.
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,"To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly"
edgarallanpoe,impossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful
edgarallanpoe,"regions, predominates even over my despair, and will reconcile me to the"
edgarallanpoe,most hideous aspect of death. It is evident that we are hurrying onwards
edgarallanpoe,"to some exciting knowledge--some never-to-be-imparted secret, whose"
edgarallanpoe,attainment is destruction. Perhaps this current leads us to the southern
edgarallanpoe,pole itself. It must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild
edgarallanpoe,has every probability in its favor.
edgarallanpoe,* * * * *
edgarallanpoe,The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step; but there is
edgarallanpoe,upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than
edgarallanpoe,of the apathy of despair.
edgarallanpoe,"In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as we carry a crowd"
edgarallanpoe,"of canvas, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea--Oh,"
edgarallanpoe,"horror upon horror! the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the"
edgarallanpoe,"left, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles, round"
edgarallanpoe,"and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre, the summit of whose"
edgarallanpoe,walls is lost in the darkness and the distance. But little time will be
edgarallanpoe,left me to ponder upon my destiny--the circles rapidly grow small--we
edgarallanpoe,are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool--and amid a
edgarallanpoe,"roaring, and bellowing, and thundering of ocean and of tempest, the ship"
edgarallanpoe,"is quivering, oh God! and--going down."
edgarallanpoe,"NOTE.--The “MS. Found in a Bottle,” was originally published in 1831,"
edgarallanpoe,and it was not until many years afterwards that I became acquainted with
edgarallanpoe,"the maps of Mercator, in which the ocean is represented as rushing, by"
edgarallanpoe,"four mouths, into the (northern) Polar Gulf, to be absorbed into the"
edgarallanpoe,"bowels of the earth; the Pole itself being represented by a black rock,"
edgarallanpoe,towering to a prodigious height.
edgarallanpoe,THE OVAL PORTRAIT
edgarallanpoe,"THE chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance,"
edgarallanpoe,"rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a"
edgarallanpoe,"night in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom and"
edgarallanpoe,"grandeur which have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in"
edgarallanpoe,fact than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been
edgarallanpoe,temporarily and very lately abandoned. We established ourselves in one
edgarallanpoe,of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay in a
edgarallanpoe,"remote turret of the building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered"
edgarallanpoe,and antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with
edgarallanpoe,"manifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually"
edgarallanpoe,great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden
edgarallanpoe,"arabesque. In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only"
edgarallanpoe,"in their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre"
edgarallanpoe,architecture of the chateau rendered necessary--in these paintings my
edgarallanpoe,"incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so"
edgarallanpoe,that I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room--since it was
edgarallanpoe,already night--to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by
edgarallanpoe,the head of my bed--and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains
edgarallanpoe,of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done
edgarallanpoe,"that I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the"
edgarallanpoe,"contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which"
edgarallanpoe,"had been found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and"
edgarallanpoe,describe them.
edgarallanpoe,"Long--long I read--and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and"
edgarallanpoe,gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came. The position of
edgarallanpoe,"the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty,"
edgarallanpoe,"rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its"
edgarallanpoe,rays more fully upon the book.
edgarallanpoe,But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The rays of
edgarallanpoe,the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of
edgarallanpoe,the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the
edgarallanpoe,bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It
edgarallanpoe,was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood. I glanced
edgarallanpoe,"at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this"
edgarallanpoe,was not at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids
edgarallanpoe,"remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting"
edgarallanpoe,them. It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought--to make
edgarallanpoe,sure that my vision had not deceived me--to calm and subdue my fancy for
edgarallanpoe,a more sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments I again looked
edgarallanpoe,fixedly at the painting.
edgarallanpoe,That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first
edgarallanpoe,flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the
edgarallanpoe,"dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at"
edgarallanpoe,once into waking life.
edgarallanpoe,"The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. It was a"
edgarallanpoe,"mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette"
edgarallanpoe,"manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the"
edgarallanpoe,"bosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into"
edgarallanpoe,the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole. The
edgarallanpoe,"frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque. As a thing of"
edgarallanpoe,art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it
edgarallanpoe,"could have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal"
edgarallanpoe,"beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved"
edgarallanpoe,"me. Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half"
edgarallanpoe,"slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person. I saw at"
edgarallanpoe,"once that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and of the"
edgarallanpoe,"frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea--must have prevented even"
edgarallanpoe,"its momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these points, I"
edgarallanpoe,"remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my"
edgarallanpoe,"vision riveted upon the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true"
edgarallanpoe,"secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed. I had found the spell"
edgarallanpoe,"of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at"
edgarallanpoe,"first startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me. With deep"
edgarallanpoe,and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position. The
edgarallanpoe,"cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly"
edgarallanpoe,the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories. Turning
edgarallanpoe,"to the number which designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague"
edgarallanpoe,and quaint words which follow:
edgarallanpoe,"“She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of"
edgarallanpoe,"glee. And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the"
edgarallanpoe,"painter. He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride"
edgarallanpoe,"in his Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full"
edgarallanpoe,"of glee; all light and smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn; loving"
edgarallanpoe,and cherishing all things; hating only the Art which was her rival;
edgarallanpoe,dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments
edgarallanpoe,which deprived her of the countenance of her lover. It was thus a
edgarallanpoe,terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to
edgarallanpoe,"portray even his young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat"
edgarallanpoe,"meekly for many weeks in the dark, high turret-chamber where the light"
edgarallanpoe,"dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead. But he, the painter,"
edgarallanpoe,"took glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour, and from day to"
edgarallanpoe,"day. And he was a passionate, and wild, and moody man, who became lost"
edgarallanpoe,in reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell so
edgarallanpoe,ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his
edgarallanpoe,"bride, who pined visibly to all but him. Yet she smiled on and still on,"
edgarallanpoe,"uncomplainingly, because she saw that the painter (who had high renown)"
edgarallanpoe,"took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and"
edgarallanpoe,"night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited"
edgarallanpoe,and weak. And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its
edgarallanpoe,"resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of"
edgarallanpoe,the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted
edgarallanpoe,"so surpassingly well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its"
edgarallanpoe,"conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the painter"
edgarallanpoe,"had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from"
edgarallanpoe,"canvas merely, even to regard the countenance of his wife. And he would"
edgarallanpoe,not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from
edgarallanpoe,"the cheeks of her who sate beside him. And when many weeks had passed,"
edgarallanpoe,"and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one"
edgarallanpoe,"tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the"
edgarallanpoe,"flame within the socket of the lamp. And then the brush was given,"
edgarallanpoe,"and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood"
edgarallanpoe,"entranced before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while"
edgarallanpoe,"he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying"
edgarallanpoe,"with a loud voice, ‘This is indeed Life itself!’ turned suddenly to"
edgarallanpoe,regard his beloved:--She was dead!”
