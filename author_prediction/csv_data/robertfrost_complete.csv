robertfrost,I shan’t be gone long.— You come too.

robertfrost,That’s standing by the mother. It’s so young

robertfrost,I shan’t be gone long.— You come too.
robertfrost,[ 1 ]
robertfrost,A
robertfrost,BOY'S
robertfrost,WILL
robertfrost,INTO MY OWN
robertfrost,"One of my wishes is that those dark trees,"
robertfrost,"So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,"
robertfrost,"Were not, as ’twere, the merest mask of gloom."
robertfrost,But stretched away unto the edge of doom.
robertfrost,I should not be withheld but that some day
robertfrost,"Into their vastness I should steal away,"
robertfrost,"Fearless of ever finding open land,"
robertfrost,Or highway v/here the slow wheel pours the sand.
robertfrost,"I do not see why I should e’er turn back,"
robertfrost,Or those should not set forth upon my track
robertfrost,"To overtake me, who should miss me here"
robertfrost,And long to know if still I held them dear.
robertfrost,They would not find me changed from him they knew—
robertfrost,Only more sure of all I thought was true.
robertfrost,[51
robertfrost,GHOST HOUSE
robertfrost,I dwell in a lonely house I know
robertfrost,"That vanished many a summer ago,"
robertfrost,"And left no trace but the cellar walls,"
robertfrost,"And a cellar in which the daylight falls,"
robertfrost,And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow.
robertfrost,O’er ruined fences the grapevines shield
robertfrost,The woods come back to the mowing field.
robertfrost,The orchard tree has grown one copse
robertfrost,"Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops,"
robertfrost,The footpath down to the well is healed.
robertfrost,I dwell with a strangely aching heart
robertfrost,In that vanished abode there far apart
robertfrost,On that disused and forgotten road
robertfrost,That has no dust-bath now for the toad.
robertfrost,Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart;
robertfrost,The whippoorwill is coming to shout
robertfrost,And hush and cluck and flutter about:
robertfrost,I hear him begin far enough away
robertfrost,Full many a time to say his say
robertfrost,Before he arrives to say it out.
robertfrost,"It is under the small, dim, summer star."
robertfrost,I know not who these mute folk are
robertfrost,Who share the unlit place with me—
robertfrost,Those stones out under the low-limbed tree
robertfrost,Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar.
robertfrost,[ 6 ]
robertfrost,"They are tireless folk, but slow and sad,"
robertfrost,"Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,—"
robertfrost,With none among them that ever sings.
robertfrost,"And yet, in view of how many things,"
robertfrost,As sweet companions as might be had.
robertfrost,[ 7 ]
robertfrost,MY NOVEMBER GUEST
robertfrost,"My Sorrow, when she's here with me."
robertfrost,Thinks these dark days of autumn rain
robertfrost,Are beautiful as days can be;
robertfrost,"She loves the bare, the withered tree;"
robertfrost,She walks the sodden pasture lane.
robertfrost,Her pleasure will not let me stay.
robertfrost,She talks and I am fain to list:
robertfrost,She’s glad the birds are gone away.
robertfrost,She’s glad her simple worsted gray
robertfrost,Is silver now with clinging mist.
robertfrost,"The desolate, deserted trees,"
robertfrost,"The faded earth, the heavy sky."
robertfrost,"The beauties she so truly sees,"
robertfrost,She thinks I have no eye for these.
robertfrost,And vexes me for reason why.
robertfrost,Not yesterday I learned to know
robertfrost,The love of bare November days
robertfrost,Before the coming of the snow.
robertfrost,But it were vain to tell her so.
robertfrost,And they are better for her praise.
robertfrost,C83
robertfrost,LOVE AND A QUESTION
robertfrost,A Stranger came to the door at eve.
robertfrost,And he spoke the bridegroom fair.
robertfrost,He bore a green-white stick in his hand.
robertfrost,"And, for all burden, care."
robertfrost,He asked with the eyes more than the lips
robertfrost,For a shelter for die night.
robertfrost,And he turned and looked at the road afar
robertfrost,Without a window light.
robertfrost,The bridegroom came forth into the porch
robertfrost,With ‘Let us look at the sky.
robertfrost,"And question what of the night to be,"
robertfrost,"Stranger, you and 1/"
robertfrost,The woodbine leaves littered the yard.
robertfrost,"The woodbine berries were blue,"
robertfrost,"Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;"
robertfrost,"‘Stranger, I wish I knew.’"
robertfrost,"Within, the bride in the dusk alone"
robertfrost,Bent over the open fire.
robertfrost,Her face rose-red with the glowing coal
robertfrost,And the thought of the heart’s desire.
robertfrost,The bridegroom looked at the weary road.
robertfrost,"Yet saw but her within,"
robertfrost,And wished her heart in a case of gold
robertfrost,And pinned with a silver pin.
robertfrost,The bridegroom thought it little to give
robertfrost,"A dole of bread, a purse,"
robertfrost,"A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God,"
robertfrost,Or for the rich a curse;
robertfrost,19 ]
robertfrost,But whether or not a man was asked
robertfrost,To mar the love of two
robertfrost,By harboring woe in the bridal house.
robertfrost,The bridegroom wished he knew.
robertfrost,[ 10 ]
robertfrost,A LATE WALK
robertfrost,When I go up through the mowing field.
robertfrost,"The headless aftermath,"
robertfrost,Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew.
robertfrost,Half closes the garden path.
robertfrost,"And when I come to the garden ground,"
robertfrost,The whir of sober birds
robertfrost,Up from the tangle of withered weeds
robertfrost,Is sadder than any words.
robertfrost,"A tree beside the wall stands bare,"
robertfrost,"But a leaf that lingered brown,"
robertfrost,"Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,"
robertfrost,Comes softly rattling down.
robertfrost,I end not far from my going forth
robertfrost,By picking the faded blue
robertfrost,Of the last remaining aster flower
robertfrost,To carry again to you.
robertfrost,[ 11 ]
robertfrost,STARS
robertfrost,How countlessly they congregate
robertfrost,"O’er our tumultuous snow,"
robertfrost,Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
robertfrost,When wintry winds do blow!—
robertfrost,As if with keenness for our fate.
robertfrost,Our faltering few steps on
robertfrost,"To white rest, and a place of rest"
robertfrost,"Invisible at dawn,—"
robertfrost,And yet with neither love nor hate.
robertfrost,Those stars like some snow-white
robertfrost,Minerva’s snow-white marble eyes
robertfrost,Without the gift of sight.
robertfrost,[ 12 ]
robertfrost,STORM FEAR
robertfrost,"When the wind works against us in the dark,"
robertfrost,And pelts with snow
robertfrost,The lower chamber window on the east.
robertfrost,"And whispers with a sort of stifled bark,"
robertfrost,"The beast,"
robertfrost,‘Come outl Come outl’—
robertfrost,It costs no inward struggle not to go.
robertfrost,"Ah, nol"
robertfrost,I count our strength.
robertfrost,"Two and a child,"
robertfrost,Those of us not asleep subdued to mark
robertfrost,"How the cold creeps as the fire dies at length,—"
robertfrost,"How drifts are piled,"
robertfrost,"Dooryard and road ungraded,"
robertfrost,Till even the comforting bam grows far away.
robertfrost,And my heart owns a doubt
robertfrost,Whether ’tis in us to arise with day
robertfrost,And save ourselves unaided.
robertfrost,US]
robertfrost,WIND AND WINDOW FLOWER
robertfrost,"Lovers, forget your love,"
robertfrost,And list to the love of these.
robertfrost,"She a window flower,"
robertfrost,And he a winter breeze.
robertfrost,When the frosty window veil
robertfrost,Was melted down at noon.
robertfrost,And the caged yellow bird
robertfrost,"Hung over her in tune,"

robertfrost,Where bird and flower were one and the same.

robertfrost,"Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound—"

robertfrost,To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
robertfrost,And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
robertfrost,We have to use a spell to make them balance:
robertfrost,‘Stay where you are until our backs are turned!’
robertfrost,We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
robertfrost,"Oh, just another kind of outdoor game."
robertfrost,One on a side. It comes to little more:
robertfrost,There where it is we do not need the wall:
robertfrost,He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
robertfrost,My apple trees will never get across
robertfrost,"And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him"
robertfrost,"He only says, ‘Good fences make good neighbors.’"
robertfrost,"Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder"
robertfrost,If I could put a notion in his head:
robertfrost,‘Why do they make good neighbors? Isn’t it
robertfrost,Where there are cows? But here there are no cows
robertfrost,[ 47 ]
robertfrost,Before I built a wall I’d ask to know
robertfrost,What I was walling in or walling out.
robertfrost,And to whom I was like to give offense.
robertfrost,"Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,"
robertfrost,That wants it down.’ I could say ‘Elves’ to him.
robertfrost,"But it’s not elves exactly, and I’d rather"
robertfrost,He said it for himself. I see him there
robertfrost,Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
robertfrost,"In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed."
robertfrost,"He moves in darkness as it seems to me,"
robertfrost,Not of woods only and the shade of trees
robertfrost,"He will not go behind his father’s saying,"
robertfrost,And he likes having thought of it so well
robertfrost,"He says again, ‘Good fences make good neighbors.’"

robertfrost,THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN
robertfrost,Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table
robertfrost,"Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,"
robertfrost,She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage
robertfrost,To meet him in the doorway with the news
robertfrost,And put him on his guard. ‘Silas is back.’
robertfrost,She pushed him outward with her through the door
robertfrost,"And shut it after her. ‘Be kind,’ she said."
robertfrost,She took the market things from Warren’s arms
robertfrost,"And set them on the porch, then drew him down"
robertfrost,To sit beside her on the wooden steps.
robertfrost,When was I ever anything but kind to him ?
robertfrost,"But I’ll not have the fellow back,’ he said."
robertfrost,"‘I told him so last haying, didn’t I?"
robertfrost,"If he left then, I said, that ended it."
robertfrost,What good is he? Who else will harbor him
robertfrost,At his age for the little he can do?
robertfrost,What help he is there’s no depending on.
robertfrost,Off he goes always when I need him most.
robertfrost,"He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,"
robertfrost,Enough at least to buy tobacco with.
robertfrost,So he won’t have to beg and be beholden.
robertfrost,"“All right,” I say, “I can’t afford to pay"
robertfrost,"Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.”"
robertfrost,"“Someone else can.” ""Then someone else will have to.”"
robertfrost,I shouldn’t mind his bettering himself
robertfrost,"If that was what it was. You can be certain,"
robertfrost,"When he begins like that, there’s someone at him"
robertfrost,"Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,—"
robertfrost,"In haying time, when any help is scarce."
robertfrost,"In ""winter he comes back to us. I’m done.’"

robertfrost,‘He’s worn out. He’s asleep beside the stove.
robertfrost,"When I came up from Rowe’s I found him here,"
robertfrost,"Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,"
robertfrost,"A miserable sight, and frightening, too-"
robertfrost,You needn’t smile— I didn’t recognize him—
robertfrost,I wasn’t looking for him-and he’s changed.
robertfrost,Wait till you see.’
robertfrost,‘Where did you say he’d been?’
robertfrost,"‘He didn’t say. I dragged him to the house,"
robertfrost,And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.
robertfrost,I tried to make him talk about his travels.
robertfrost,Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.’
robertfrost,‘What did he say? Did he say anything?’
robertfrost,‘But little.’
robertfrost,"‘Anything? Mary, confess"
robertfrost,He said he’d come to ditch the meadow for me.’

robertfrost,‘But did he? I just want to know.’
robertfrost,‘Of course he did. What would you have him say?
robertfrost,Surely you wouldn’t grudge the poor old man
robertfrost,Some humble way to save his self-respect.
robertfrost,"He added, if you really care to know,"
robertfrost,inns. t 5 °i
robertfrost,"He meant to clear the upper pasture, too."
robertfrost,That sounds like something you have heard before?
robertfrost,"Warren, I wish you could have heard the way"
robertfrost,He jumbled everything. I stopped to look ■
robertfrost,Two or three times-he made me feel so queer-
robertfrost,To see if he was talking in his sleep.
robertfrost,He ran on Harold Wilson— you remember—
robertfrost,The boy you had in haying four years since.
robertfrost,"He’s finished school, and teaching in his college-"
robertfrost,Silas declares you’ll have to get him back.
robertfrost,He says they two will make a team for work:
robertfrost,Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!
robertfrost,The way he mixed that in with other thin gs.
robertfrost,"He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft"
robertfrost,On education— you know how they fought
robertfrost,"All through July under the blazing sun,"
robertfrost,"Silas up on the cart to build the load,"
robertfrost,Harold along beside to pitch it on.’
robertfrost,"'Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.’"
robertfrost,"‘Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream."
robertfrost,You wouldn’t think they would. How some things Imgerf
robertfrost,Harold’s young college boy’s assurance piqued him.
robertfrost,After so many years he still keeps finding
robertfrost,Good arguments he sees he might have used.
robertfrost,I sympathize. I know just how it feels
robertfrost,To think of the right thing to say too late.
robertfrost,Harold’s associated in his mind with Latin.
robertfrost,He asked me what I thought of Harold’s saying
robertfrost,He studied Latin like the violin
robertfrost,Because he liked it— that an argument!
robertfrost,He said he couldn’t make the boy believe
robertfrost,[ 51 ]
robertfrost,He could find water with a hazel prong—
robertfrost,Which showed how much good school had ever done hire .
robertfrost,He wanted to go over that. But most of all
robertfrost,He thinks if he could have another chance
robertfrost,To teach him how to build a load of hay—’
robertfrost,"‘I know, that’s Silas’ one accomplishment."
robertfrost,He bundles every forkful in its place.
robertfrost,And tags and numbers it for future reference.
robertfrost,So he can find and easily dislodge it
robertfrost,In the unloading. Silas does that well.
robertfrost,He takes it out in bunches like big birds’ nests.
robertfrost,You never see him standing on the hay
robertfrost,"He’s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.’"
robertfrost,"He t h i n ks if he could teach him that, he’d be"
robertfrost,Some good perhaps to someone in the world.
robertfrost,He hates to see a boy the fool of books.
robertfrost,"Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk."
robertfrost,"And nothing to look backward to with pride,"
robertfrost,"And nothing to look forward to with hope,"
robertfrost,So now and never any different.’
robertfrost,Part of a moon was falling down the west.
robertfrost,Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.
robertfrost,Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw it
robertfrost,And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand
robertfrost,"Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,"
robertfrost,Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves.
robertfrost,As if she played unheard some tenderness
robertfrost,That wrought on him beside her in the night.
robertfrost,"‘Warren, she said, lie has come home to die:"
robertfrost,You needn t be afraid he’ll leave you this time.’
robertfrost,[ 52 ]
robertfrost,‘Home/ he mocked gently.
robertfrost,"“Yes, what else but home?"
robertfrost,It all depends on what you mean by home.
robertfrost,"Of course he’s nothing to us, any more"
robertfrost,Than was the hound that came a stranger to us
robertfrost,"Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail,’"
robertfrost,"Home is the place where, when you have to go there,"
robertfrost,They have to take you in/
robertfrost,1 should have called it
robertfrost,Something you somehow haven’t to deserve/
robertfrost,"Warren leaned out and took a step or two,"
robertfrost,"Picked up a little stick, and brought it back"
robertfrost,And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.
robertfrost,‘Silas has better claim on us you think
robertfrost,Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles
robertfrost,As the road winds would bring him to his door.
robertfrost,Silas has walked that far no doubt today.
robertfrost,"Why doesn’t he go there? His brother’s rich,"
robertfrost,A somebody— director in the bank/
robertfrost,‘He never told us that/
robertfrost,We know it though/
robertfrost,"T think his brother ought to help, of course."
robertfrost,I’ll see to that if there is need. He ought of right
robertfrost,"To take him in, and might be willing to—"
robertfrost,He may be better than appearances.
robertfrost,But have some pity on Silas. Do you think
robertfrost,[ 53 ]
robertfrost,If he had any pride m claiming kin
robertfrost,Or anything he looked for from his brother.
robertfrost,He’d keep so still about him all this time?’
robertfrost,1 wonder what’s between them.’
robertfrost,‘I can tell you.
robertfrost,Silas is what he is— we wouldn’t mind him—
robertfrost,But just the kind that kinsfolk can’t abide.
robertfrost,He never did a thing so very bad.
robertfrost,He don’t know why he isn’t quite as good
robertfrost,"As anybody. Worthless though he is,"
robertfrost,He won’t be made ashamed to please his brother ’
robertfrost,7 can’t think Si ever hurt anyone.’
robertfrost,"‘No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay"
robertfrost,And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.
robertfrost,He wouldn’t let me put him on the lounge.
robertfrost,You must go in and see what you can do.
robertfrost,I made the bed up for him there tonight.
robertfrost,You’ll be surprised at him— how much he’s broken.
robertfrost,His working days are done; I'm sure of it.’
robertfrost,Yd not be in a hurry to say that.’
robertfrost,"‘I haven’t been. Go, look, see for yourself."
robertfrost,"But, Warren, please remember how it is:"
robertfrost,He’s come to help you ditch the meadow.
robertfrost,He has a plan. You mustn’t laugh at him.
robertfrost,"He may not speak of it, and then he may."
robertfrost,Til sit and see if that small sailing cloud
robertfrost,Will hit or miss the moon/
robertfrost,[ 54 ]
robertfrost,It hit the moon.
robertfrost,"Then there were three there, making a dim row,"
robertfrost,"The moon, the little silver cloud, and she."
robertfrost,"Warren returned— too soon, it seemed to her,"

robertfrost,"""Warren?’ she questioned."
robertfrost,"‘Dead,’ was all he answered."

robertfrost,THE MOUNTAIN
robertfrost,The mountain held the town as in a shadow.
robertfrost,I saw so much before I slept there once:
robertfrost,"I noticed that I missed stars in the west,"
robertfrost,Where its black body cut into the sky.
robertfrost,Near me it seemed: I felt it like a wall
robertfrost,Behind which I was sheltered from a wind.
robertfrost,"And yet between the town and it I found,"
robertfrost,"When I walked forth at dawn to see new things,"
robertfrost,"Were fields, a river, and beyond, more fields."
robertfrost,"The river at the time was fallen away,"
robertfrost,And made a widespread brawl on cobblestones;
robertfrost,But the signs showed what it had done in spring:
robertfrost,"Good grassland gullied out, and in the grass"
robertfrost,"Bidges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark."
robertfrost,I crossed the river and swung round the mountain.
robertfrost,And there I met a man who moved so slow
robertfrost,With white-faced oxen in a heavy cart.
robertfrost,It seemed no harm to stop him altogether.
robertfrost,'What town is this?' I asked.
robertfrost,‘This? Lunenburg.’
robertfrost,"Then I was wrong: the town of my sojourn,"
robertfrost,"Beyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain,"
robertfrost,But only felt at night its shadowy presence.
robertfrost,‘Where is your village? Very far from here?'
robertfrost,There is no village— only scattered farms.
robertfrost,We were but sixty voters last election.
robertfrost,We can’t in nature grow to manv more:
robertfrost,[ 56 ]
robertfrost,That thing takes all the room!’ He moved his goad.
robertfrost,The mountain stood there to be pointed at.
robertfrost,"Pasture ran up the side a little way,"
robertfrost,And then there was a wall of trees with trunks;
robertfrost,"After that only tops of trees, and cliffs"
robertfrost,Imperfectly concealed among the leaves.
robertfrost,A dry ravine emerged from under boughs
robertfrost,Into the pasture.
robertfrost,‘That looks like a path.
robertfrost,Is that the way to reach the top from here?—
robertfrost,"Not for this morning, but some other time:"
robertfrost,I must be getting back to breakfast now.’
robertfrost,‘I don’t advise your trying from this side.
robertfrost,"There is no proper path, but those that have"
robertfrost,"Been up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd’s."
robertfrost,That’s five miles back. You can’t mistake the place:
robertfrost,They logged it there last winter some way up.
robertfrost,"I’d take you, but I’m bound the other way.’"
robertfrost,'You’ve never climbed it?’
robertfrost,"Tve been on the sides,"
robertfrost,Deer-hunting and trout-fishing. There’s a brook
robertfrost,That starts up on it somewhere— I’ve heard say
robertfrost,"Right on the top, tip-top— a curious thing."
robertfrost,But what would interest you about the brook.
robertfrost,"It’s always cold in summer, warm in winter."
robertfrost,One of the great sights going is to see
robertfrost,It steam in winter like an ox’s breath.
robertfrost,Until the bushes all along its banks
robertfrost,Are inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles—
robertfrost,You know the kind. Then let the sun shine on it!’
robertfrost,[ 57 ]
robertfrost,There ought to be a view around the world
robertfrost,From such a mountain— if it isn’t wooded
robertfrost,Clear to the top.' I saw through leafy screens
robertfrost,Great granite terraces in sun and shadow.
robertfrost,Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up—
robertfrost,With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet
robertfrost,Or turn and sit on and look out and down.
robertfrost,With little ferns in crevices at his elbow.
robertfrost,‘As to that I can’t say. But there’s the spring.
robertfrost,"Right on the summit, almost like a fountain."
robertfrost,That ought to be worth seeing.’
robertfrost,You never saw it?’
robertfrost,‘If it’s there
robertfrost,‘I guess there’s no doubt
robertfrost,About its being there. I never saw it.
robertfrost,It may not be right on the very top :
robertfrost,It wouldn’t have to be a long way down
robertfrost,To have some head of water from above.
robertfrost,And a good distance down might not be noticed
robertfrost,By anyone who’d come a long way up.
robertfrost,One time I asked a fellow climbing it
robertfrost,To look and tell me later how it was.’
robertfrost,What did he say?’
robertfrost,'He said there was a lake
robertfrost,Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top.'
robertfrost,'Em a lake’s different. What about the spring?’
robertfrost,158 ]
robertfrost,‘He never got up high enough to see.
robertfrost,That's why I don’t advise your trying this side.
robertfrost,He tried this side. I’ve always meant to go
robertfrost,"And look myself, but you know how it is:"
robertfrost,It doesn’t seem so much to climb a mountain
robertfrost,You’ve worked around the foot of all your life.
robertfrost,"What would I do? Go in my overalls,"
robertfrost,"With a big stick, the same as when the cows"
robertfrost,Haven’t come down to the bars at milking time?
robertfrost,Or with a shotgun for a stray black bear?
robertfrost,’Twouldn’t seem real to climb for climbing it’
robertfrost,T shouldn’t climb it if I didn’t want to—
robertfrost,Not for the sake of climbing. What’s its name?’
robertfrost,*We call it Hor: I don’t know if that’s right.’
robertfrost,‘Can one walk around it? Would it be too far?’
robertfrost,"*You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg,"
robertfrost,But it’s as much as ever you can do.
robertfrost,The boundary lines keep in so close to it.
robertfrost,"Hor is the township, and the township’s Hor—"
robertfrost,And a few houses sprinkled round the foot.
robertfrost,Like boulders broken off the upper cliff.
robertfrost,Rolled out a little farther than the rest.’
robertfrost,"‘Warm in December, cold in June, you say?’"
robertfrost,T don’t suppose the water’s changed at all.
robertfrost,You and I know enough to know it’s warm
robertfrost,"Compared with cold, and cold compared with warm"
robertfrost,But all the fun’s in how you say a thing.’
robertfrost,[ 59 ]
robertfrost,‘You’ve lived here all your life?’
robertfrost,‘Ever since Hor
robertfrost,"Was no bigger than a—’ What, I did not hear."
robertfrost,He drew the oxen toward him with light touches
robertfrost,"Of his slim goad on nose and offside flank,"
robertfrost,Gave them their marching orders and was moving.

robertfrost,A HUNDRED COLLARS
robertfrost,Lancaster bore him— such a little town.
robertfrost,Such a great man. It doesn’t see him often
robertfrost,"Of late years, though he keeps the old homestead"
robertfrost,And sends the children down there with their mother
robertfrost,To run wild in the summer— a little wild.
robertfrost,Sometimes he joins them for a day or two
robertfrost,And sees old friends he somehow can’t get near.
robertfrost,They meet him in the general store at night.
robertfrost,Preoccupied -with formidable mail.
robertfrost,Rifling a printed letter as he talks.
robertfrost,They seem afraid. He wouldn’t have it so:
robertfrost,"Though a great scholar, he’s a democrat."
robertfrost,"If not at heart, at least on principle."
robertfrost,"Lately when coming up to Lancaster,"
robertfrost,"His train being late, he missed another tr ain"
robertfrost,And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction
robertfrost,After eleven o’clock at night. Too tired
robertfrost,To think of sitting such an ordeal out.
robertfrost,He turned to the hotel to find a bed.
robertfrost,"‘No room,’ the night clerk said. ‘Unless—"
robertfrost,Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps
robertfrost,And cars that shock and rattle— and one hotel.
robertfrost,*You say “unless.” ’
robertfrost,‘Unless you wouldn’t mind
robertfrost,Sharing a room with someone else.’
robertfrost,[ 61 ]
robertfrost,‘Who is it?
robertfrost,'A man;
robertfrost,‘So I should hope. What kind of man?’
robertfrost,1 know him: he’s all right. A mans a man.
robertfrost,"Separate beds, of course, you understand.’"
robertfrost,The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on.
robertfrost,‘Who’s that man sleeping in the office chair?
robertfrost,Has he had the refusal of my chance?’
robertfrost,‘He was afraid of being robbed or murdered.
robertfrost,What do you say?’
robertfrost,TU have to have a bed.’
robertfrost,The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs
robertfrost,"And down a narrow passage full of doors,"
robertfrost,At the last one of which he knocked and entered.
robertfrost,"‘Lafe, here’s a fellow wants to share your room.’"
robertfrost,‘Show him this way. I’m not afraid of him.
robertfrost,I’m not so drunk I can’t take care of myself.’
robertfrost,The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot.
robertfrost,"‘This will be yours. Good-night,’ he said, and went."
robertfrost,"‘Lafe was the name, I think?’"
robertfrost,"‘Yes, Layfayette."
robertfrost,You got it the first time. And yours?’
robertfrost,‘Magoon.
robertfrost,Doctor Magoon.’
robertfrost,[ 62 ]
robertfrost,‘A Doctor?’
robertfrost,"""Well, a teacher.’"
robertfrost,‘Professor Square-the-circle-till-you’re-tired?

robertfrost,That I had on my mind to ask the first
robertfrost,Man that knew anything I happened in with.
robertfrost,I’ll ask you later— don’t let me forget it.’
robertfrost,The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away.
robertfrost,"A man? A brute. Naked above the waist,"
robertfrost,He sat there creased and shining in the light.
robertfrost,Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt.
robertfrost,'I’m moving into a size-larger shirt.
robertfrost,I’ve felt mean lately; mean’s no name for it.
robertfrost,I just found what the matter was tonight:
robertfrost,I’ve been a-choking like a nursery tree
robertfrost,When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag.
robertfrost,I blamed it on the hot spell we’ve been having.
robertfrost,’Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back.
robertfrost,Not liking to own up I’d grown a size.
robertfrost,Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?’
robertfrost,The Doctor caught his throat convulsively.
robertfrost,‘Oh— ah— fourteen— fourteen.’
robertfrost,‘Fourteen I You say so!
robertfrost,I can remember when I wore fourteen.
robertfrost,And come to think I must have back at home
robertfrost,"More than a hundred collars, size fourteen."
robertfrost,Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them.
robertfrost,[ 63 ]
robertfrost,They’re yours and welcome; let me send them to you.
robertfrost,What makes you stand there on one leg like that?
robertfrost,You’re not much furtherer than where Kike left you.
robertfrost,You act as if you wished you hadn’t come.
robertfrost,"Sit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous.’"
robertfrost,"The Doctor made a subdued dash for it,"
robertfrost,And propped himself at bay against a pillow.
robertfrost,"“Not that way, with your shoes on Kike’s white bed."
robertfrost,You can’t rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off.’
robertfrost,"‘Don’t touch me, please— I say, don’t touch me, please."
robertfrost,"I’ll not be put to bed by you, my man.’"
robertfrost,‘Just as you say. Have it your own way then.
robertfrost,“My man” is it? You talk like a professor.
robertfrost,"Speaking of who’s afraid of who, however,"
robertfrost,I’m thinking I have more to lose than you
robertfrost,If anything should happen to be wrong.
robertfrost,Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat!
robertfrost,Let’s have a showdown as an evidence
robertfrost,Of good faith. There is ninety dollars.
robertfrost,"Come, if you’re not afraid.’"
robertfrost,‘Z’m not afraid.
robertfrost,There’s five: that’s all I carry.’
robertfrost,‘I can search you?
robertfrost,Where are you moving over to? Stay still.
robertfrost,You’d better tuck your money under you
robertfrost,And sleep on it the way I always do
robertfrost,When I’m with people I don’t trust at night.’
robertfrost,[ 64 ]
robertfrost,“Will you believe me if I put it there
robertfrost,Right on the counterpane— that I do trust you?’
robertfrost,"'You’d say so, Mister Man.— I’m a collector."
robertfrost,My ninety isn’t mine— you won’t think that.
robertfrost,I pick it up a dollar at a time
robertfrost,"All round the country for the Weekly News,"
robertfrost,Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News F
robertfrost,“Known it since I was young.’
robertfrost,'Then you know me.
robertfrost,Now we are getting on together— talking.
robertfrost,I'm sort of Something for it at the front.

robertfrost,“Feel out the public sentiment”— he says.
robertfrost,A good deal comes on me when all is said.
robertfrost,The only trouble is we disagree
robertfrost,In politics: I’m Vermont Democrat—
robertfrost,"You know what that is, sort of double-dyed;"
robertfrost,The News has always been Republican.
robertfrost,"Fairbanks, he says to me, “Help us this year,”"
robertfrost,"Meaning by us their ticket. “No,” I says,"
robertfrost,“I can’t and won’t. You’ve been in long enough:
robertfrost,It’s time you turned around and boosted us.

robertfrost,I doubt if I could do it anyway.” ’
robertfrost,“You seem to shape the paper’s policy.’

robertfrost,I almost know their farms as well as they do.
robertfrost,‘You drive around? It must be pleasant work.’
robertfrost,"‘It’s business, but I can’t say it’s not fun."
robertfrost,What I like best’s the lay of different farms.
robertfrost,Coming out on them from a stretch of woods.
robertfrost,Or over a hill or round a sudden corner.
robertfrost,"I like to find folks getting out in spring,"
robertfrost,"Raking the dooryard, working near the house."
robertfrost,Later they get out further in the fields.
robertfrost,Everything’s shut sometimes except the bam;
robertfrost,The family’s all away in some back meadow.
robertfrost,There’s a hay load a-coming— when it comes.
robertfrost,And later still they all get driven in:
robertfrost,"The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches"
robertfrost,"Stripped to bare ground, the maple trees"
robertfrost,To whips and poles. There’s nobody about.
robertfrost,"The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking."

robertfrost,‘One would suppose they might not be as glad

robertfrost,[ 66 ]
robertfrost,"‘Oh,"
robertfrost,Because I want their dollar? I don’t want
robertfrost,Anything they’ve not got. I never dun.

robertfrost,"You’ll rest easier when I’m gone, perhaps—"
robertfrost,Lie down— let yourself go and get some sleep.
robertfrost,But first— let’s see— what was I going to ask you?
robertfrost,Those collars— who shall I address them to.
robertfrost,Suppose you aren’t awake when I come back?’
robertfrost,"‘Really, friend, I can’t let you. You— may need them.’"
robertfrost,"“Not till I shrink, when they’ll be out of style.’"
robertfrost,‘But really I— I have so many collars.’
robertfrost,‘I don’t know who I rather would have have them.
robertfrost,They’re only turning yellow where they are.
robertfrost,But you’re the doctor as the saying is.
robertfrost,I’ll put the light out. Don’t you wait for me:
robertfrost,I’ve just begun the night. You get some sleep.
robertfrost,Ill knock so-fashion and peep round the door
robertfrost,When I come back so you’ll know who it is.
robertfrost,There’s nothing I’m afraid of like scared people.
robertfrost,I don’t want you should shoot me in the head.
robertfrost,[6 7 ]
robertfrost,What am I doing carrying off this bottle?
robertfrost,"There now, you get some sleep/"
robertfrost,He shut the door.
robertfrost,The Doctor slid a little down the pillow.
robertfrost,[ 68 ]
robertfrost,HOME BURIAL
robertfrost,He saw her from the bottom of the stairs
robertfrost,"Before she saw him. She was starting down,"
robertfrost,Looking back over her shoulder at some fear.
robertfrost,She took a doubtful step and then undid it
robertfrost,To raise herself and look agam. He spoke
robertfrost,Advancing toward her. ‘What is it you see
robertfrost,From up there always— for I want to know.’
robertfrost,"She turned and sank upon her skirts at that,"
robertfrost,And her face changed from terrified to dull.
robertfrost,"He said to gain time: What is it you see,’"
robertfrost,Mounting until she cowered under him.
robertfrost,"‘I will find out now— you must tell me, dear.’"
robertfrost,"She, in her place, refused him any help"
robertfrost,With the least stiffening of her neck and silence.
robertfrost,"She let him look, sure that he wouldn’t see,"
robertfrost,Blind creature; and awhile he didn’t see.
robertfrost,"But at last he murmured, ‘Oh,’ and again, ‘Oh.’"
robertfrost,What is it— what?’ she said.
robertfrost,‘Just that I see.’
robertfrost,‘You don’t/ she challenged. ‘Tell me what it is.’
robertfrost,The wonder is I didn’t see at once.
robertfrost,I never noticed it from here before.
robertfrost,I must be wonted to it— that’s the reason.
robertfrost,The little graveyard where my people are!
robertfrost,So small the window frames the whole of it.
robertfrost,"Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?"
robertfrost,"There are three stones of slate and one of marble,"
robertfrost,[ 69 ]
robertfrost,Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunhght
robertfrost,On the sidehill. We haven’t to mind those.
robertfrost,"But I understand, it is not the stones,"
robertfrost,But the child’s mound—
robertfrost,"‘Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t/ she cried."
robertfrost,She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm
robertfrost,"That rested on the bannister, and slid downstairs,"
robertfrost,"And turned on him with such a daunting look,"
robertfrost,He said twice over before he knew himself:
robertfrost,‘Can’t a man speak of his own child he’s lost?’
robertfrost,"‘Not you! Oh, where’s my hat? Oh, I don’t need it!"
robertfrost,I must get out of here. I must get air.
robertfrost,I don’t know rightly whether any man can.’
robertfrost,‘Amy! Don’t go to someone else this time.
robertfrost,Listen to me. I won’t come down the stairs.’
robertfrost,He sat and fixed his chin between his fists.
robertfrost,"‘There’s something I should like to ask you, dear/"
robertfrost,‘You don’t know how to ask it.’
robertfrost,"‘Help me, then.’"
robertfrost,Her fingers moved the latch for all reply.
robertfrost,‘My words are nearly always an ofiFense.
robertfrost,I don’t know how to speak of anything
robertfrost,So as to please you. But I might be taught
robertfrost,I should suppose. I can’t say I see how.
robertfrost,A man must partly give up being a man
robertfrost,With women-folk. We could have some arrangement
robertfrost,[ 70 ]
robertfrost,By which I’d bind myself to keep hands off
robertfrost,Anything special you’re a-mind to name.
robertfrost,Though I don’t like such things ’twixt those that love.
robertfrost,Two that don’t love can’t live together without them.
robertfrost,But two that do can’t live together with them.’
robertfrost,She moved the latch a little. ‘Don’t— don’t go.
robertfrost,Don’t carry it to someone else this time.
robertfrost,Tell me about it if it’s something human.
robertfrost,Let me into your grief. I’m not so much
robertfrost,Unlike other folks as your standing there
robertfrost,Apart would make me out. Give me my chance.
robertfrost,"I do think, though, you overdo it a little."
robertfrost,What was it brought you up to think it the thing
robertfrost,To take your mother-loss of a first child
robertfrost,So inconsolably— in the face of love.
robertfrost,You'd think his memory might be satisfied—’
robertfrost,"""There you go sneering now!’"
robertfrost,‘I’m not. I’m not!
robertfrost,You make me angry. I’ll come down to you.
robertfrost,"God, what a woman! And its come to this,"
robertfrost,A man can’t speak of his own child that’s dead.’
robertfrost,“You can’t because you don’t know how to speak.
robertfrost,"If you had any feelings, you that dug"
robertfrost,With your own hand— how could you?— his little grave;
robertfrost,"I saw you from that very window there,"
robertfrost,"Making the gravel leap and leap in air,"
robertfrost,"Leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly"
robertfrost,And roll back down the mound beside the hole.
robertfrost,I thought. Who is that man? I didn’t know you.
robertfrost,And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs
robertfrost,[ 71 ]
robertfrost,"To look again, and still your spade kept lifting."
robertfrost,Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice
robertfrost,"Out in the kitchen, and I don’t know why,"
robertfrost,But I went near to see with my own eyes.
robertfrost,You could sit there with the stains on your shoes
robertfrost,Of the fresh earth from your own baby’s grave
robertfrost,And talk about your everyday concerns.
robertfrost,You had stood the spade up against the wall
robertfrost,"Outside there in the entry, for I saw it.’"
robertfrost,1 shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed.
robertfrost,"I’m cursed. God, if I don’t believe I’m cursed.’"
robertfrost,T can repeat the very words you were saying.
robertfrost,“Three foggy mornings and one rainy day
robertfrost,Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.”
robertfrost,"Think of it, talk like that at such a timel"
robertfrost,What had how long it takes a birch to rot
robertfrost,To do with what was in the darkened parlor.
robertfrost,You couldn’t care! The nearest friends can go
robertfrost,"With anyone to death, comes so far short"
robertfrost,They might as well not try to go at all
robertfrost,"No, from the time when one is sick to death."
robertfrost,"One is alone, and he dies more alone."
robertfrost,Friends make pretense of following to the grave.
robertfrost,"But before one is in it, their minds are turned"
robertfrost,And making the best of their way back to life
robertfrost,"And living people, and things they understand."
robertfrost,But the world’s evil. I won’t have grief so
robertfrost,"If I can change it. Oh, I won’t I won’t!’"
robertfrost,"There, you have said it all and you feel better."
robertfrost,You won’t go now. You're crying. Close the door.
robertfrost,[ 72 ]
robertfrost,The heart's gone out of it: why keep it up.
robertfrost,Amy! There’s someone coming down the road!’
robertfrost,"Yon— oh, you think the talk is all. I must go—"
robertfrost,Somewhere out of this house. How can I make you—*
robertfrost,‘If— you— do!’ She was opening the door wider.
robertfrost,‘Where do you mean to go? First tell me that.
robertfrost,I’ll follow and bring you back by force. I willl—
robertfrost,[ 73 ]
robertfrost,THE BLACK COTTAGE
robertfrost,We chanced in passing by that afternoon
robertfrost,To catch it in a sort of special picture
robertfrost,"Among tar-banded ancient cherry trees,"
robertfrost,Set well bach from the road in rank lodged grass.
robertfrost,"The little cottage we were speaking of,"
robertfrost,A front with just a door between two windows.
robertfrost,Fresh painted by the shower a velvet black.
robertfrost,"We paused, the minister and I, to look."
robertfrost,He made as if to hold it at arm's length
robertfrost,Or put the leaves aside that framed it in.
robertfrost,"""Pretty/ he said. ‘Come in. No one will care/"
robertfrost,The path was a vague parting in the grass
robertfrost,That led us to a weathered window-sill.
robertfrost,"We pressed our faces to the pane. ‘You see/ he said,"
robertfrost,‘Everything’s as she left it when she died.
robertfrost,Her sons won’t sell the house or the things m it.
robertfrost,They say they mean to come and summer here
robertfrost,Where they were boys. They haven’t come this year.
robertfrost,They live so far away— one is out west—
robertfrost,It will be hard for them to keep their word.
robertfrost,Anyway they won’t have the place disturbed.’
robertfrost,A buttoned hair-cloth lounge spread scrolling arms
robertfrost,"Under a crayon portrait on the wall,"
robertfrost,Done sadly from an old daguerreotype.
robertfrost,That was the father as he went to war.
robertfrost,"She always, when she talked about the war."
robertfrost,"Sooner or later came and leaned, half knelt"
robertfrost,"Against the lounge beside it, though I doubt"
robertfrost,If such unhfelike lines kept power to stir
robertfrost,Anything in her after all the years.
robertfrost,"He fell at Gettysburg or Fredericksburg,"
robertfrost,[ 74 ]
robertfrost,I ought to know— it makes a difference which:
robertfrost,"Fredericksburg wasn’t Gettysburg, of course."
robertfrost,But what I’m getting to is how forsaken
robertfrost,A little cottage this has always seemed;
robertfrost,"Since she went more than ever, but before—"
robertfrost,I don’t mean altogether by the hves
robertfrost,"That had gone out of it, the father first."
robertfrost,"Then the two sons, till she was left alone."
robertfrost,(Nothing could draw her after those two sons.
robertfrost,She valued the considerate neglect
robertfrost,She had at some cost taught them after years.)
robertfrost,I mean by the world’s having passed it by—
robertfrost,As we almost got by this afternoon.
robertfrost,It always seems to me a sort of mark
robertfrost,To measure how far fifty years have brought us.
robertfrost,Why not sit down if you are in no haste?
robertfrost,These doorsteps seldom have a visitor.
robertfrost,The warping boards pull out their own old nails
robertfrost,With none to tread and put them in their place.
robertfrost,"She had her own idea of things, the old lady."
robertfrost,And she liked talk. She had seen Garrison
robertfrost,"And Whittier, and had her story of them."
robertfrost,One wasn’t long in learning that she thought
robertfrost,"Whatever else the Civil War was for,"
robertfrost,It wasn’t just to keep the States together.
robertfrost,"Nor just to free the slaves, though it did both."
robertfrost,She wouldn’t have believed those ends enough
robertfrost,To have given outright for them all she gave.
robertfrost,Her giving somehow touched the principle
robertfrost,That all men are created free and equal.
robertfrost,And to hear her quaint phrases— so removed
robertfrost,From the world’s view today of all those things.
robertfrost,That’s a hard mystery of Jefferson’s.
robertfrost,[ 75 ]
robertfrost,What did he mean? Of course the easy way
robertfrost,Is to decide it simply isn’t true.
robertfrost,It may not be. I heard a fellow say so.
robertfrost,"But never mind, the Welshman got it planted"
robertfrost,Where it will trouble us a thousand years.
robertfrost,Each age will have to reconsider it.
robertfrost,"You couldn’t tell her what the West was saying,"
robertfrost,And what the South to her serene belief.
robertfrost,She had some art of hearing and yet not
robertfrost,Hearing the latter wisdom of the world.
robertfrost,White was the only race she ever knew.
robertfrost,"Black she had scarcely seen, and yellow never."
robertfrost,But how could they be made so very unlike
robertfrost,By the same hand working in the same stuff?
robertfrost,She had supposed the war decided that.
robertfrost,What are you going to do with such a person?
robertfrost,Strange how such innocence gets its own way.
robertfrost,I shouldn’t be surprised if in this world
robertfrost,It were the force that would at last prevail.
robertfrost,Do you know but for her there was a time
robertfrost,"When to please younger members of the church,"
robertfrost,"Or rather say non-members in the church,"
robertfrost,"Whom we all have to think of nowadays,"
robertfrost,I would have changed the Creed a very little?
robertfrost,Not that she ever had to ask me not to;
robertfrost,It never got so far as that; but the bare thought
robertfrost,"Of her old tremulous bonnet in the pew,"
robertfrost,And of her half asleep was too much for me.
robertfrost,"Why, I might wake her up and startle her."
robertfrost,It was the words “descended into Hades”
robertfrost,That seemed too pagan to our liberal youth.
robertfrost,You know they suffered from a general onslaught.
robertfrost,"And well, if they weren’t true why keep right on"
robertfrost,[ 76 ]
robertfrost,Saying them like the heathen? We could drop them.
robertfrost,Only— there was the bonnet in the pew.
robertfrost,Such a phrase couldn’t have meant much to her.
robertfrost,But suppose she had missed it from the Creed
robertfrost,"As a child misses the unsaid Good-night,"
robertfrost,And falls asleep with heartache— how should I feel?
robertfrost,I’m just as glad she made me keep hands off.
robertfrost,"For, dear me, why abandon a belief"
robertfrost,Merely because it ceases to be true.
robertfrost,"Cling to it long enough, and not a doubt"
robertfrost,"It will turn true again, for so it goes."
robertfrost,Most of the change we think we see in life
robertfrost,Is due to truths being in and out of favor.
robertfrost,"As I sit here, and oftentimes, I wish"
robertfrost,I could be monarch of a desert land
robertfrost,I could devote and dedicate forever
robertfrost,To the truths we keep coming back and back to.
robertfrost,"So desert it would have to be, so walled"
robertfrost,By mountain ranges half in summer snow.
robertfrost,No one would covet it or think it worth
robertfrost,The pains of conquering to force change on.
robertfrost,"Scattered oases where men dwelt, but mostly"
robertfrost,Sand dunes held loosely in tamarisk
robertfrost,Blown over and over themselves in idleness.
robertfrost,Sand grains should sugar in the natal dew
robertfrost,"The babe bom to the desert, the sand storm"
robertfrost,Retard mid-waste my cowering caravans—
robertfrost,There are bees in this wall.’ He struck the clapboards.
robertfrost,Fierce heads looked out; small bodies pivoted.
robertfrost,We rose to go. Sunset blazed on the windows.
robertfrost,[ 77 ]
robertfrost,BLUEBERRIES
robertfrost,‘You ought to have seen what I saw on my way
robertfrost,"To the village, through Pattersons pasture today:"
robertfrost,Blueberries as big as the end of your thumb.
robertfrost,"Real sky-blue, and heavy, and ready to drum"
robertfrost,In the cavernous pail of the first one to come!
robertfrost,"And all ripe together, not some of them green"
robertfrost,And some of them ripe! You ought to have seen!’
robertfrost,‘I don’t know what part of the pasture you mean.’
robertfrost,‘You know where they cut off the woods— let me see—
robertfrost,It was two years ago— or no!— can it be
robertfrost,No longer than that?— and the following fall
robertfrost,The fire ran and burned it all up but the wall.’
robertfrost,"'Why, there hasn’t been time for the bushes to grow."
robertfrost,"That’s always the way with the blueberries, though:"
robertfrost,There may not have been the ghost of a sign
robertfrost,Of them anywhere under the shade of the pine.
robertfrost,"But get the pine out of the way, you may bum"
robertfrost,The pasture all over until not a fern
robertfrost,"Or grass-blade is left, not to mention a stick,"
robertfrost,"And presto, they’re up all around you as thick"
robertfrost,And hard to explain as a conjuror’s trick.’
robertfrost,‘It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit.
robertfrost,I taste in them sometimes the flavor of soot.
robertfrost,And after all really they’re ebony skinned:
robertfrost,"The blue’s but a mist from the breath of the wind,"
robertfrost,"A tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand,"
robertfrost,And less than the tan with which pickers are tanned.’
robertfrost,[ 78 ]
robertfrost,"‘Does Patterson know what he has, do jou think?’"
robertfrost,‘He may and not care and so leave the chewink
robertfrost,To gather them for him— you know what he is.
robertfrost,He won’t make the fact that they’re rightfully his
robertfrost,An excuse for keeping us other folk out.’
robertfrost,‘I wonder you didn’t see Loren about.’
robertfrost,"‘The best of it was that I did. Do you know,"
robertfrost,I was just getting through what the field had to show
robertfrost,And over the wall and into the road.
robertfrost,"When who should come by, with a democrat-load"
robertfrost,Of all the young chattering Lorens alive.
robertfrost,"But Loren, the fatherly, out for a drive.’"
robertfrost,"‘He saw you, then? What did he do? Did he frown?’"
robertfrost,‘He just kept nodding his head up and down.
robertfrost,You know how politely he always goes by.
robertfrost,But he thought a big thought— I could tell by his eye—
robertfrost,"Which being expressed, might be this in effect:"
robertfrost,"“I have left those there berries, I shrewdly suspect."
robertfrost,To ripen too long. I am greatly to blame.” ’
robertfrost,‘He’s a thriftier person than some I could name.’
robertfrost,"‘He seems to be thrifty; and hasn’t he need,"
robertfrost,With the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed?
robertfrost,"He has brought them all up on wild berries, they say."
robertfrost,Like birds. They store a great many away.
robertfrost,"They eat them the year round, and those they don’t eat"
robertfrost,They sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet.’
robertfrost,[ 79 ]
robertfrost,Who cares what they say? It’s a nice way to live.
robertfrost,"Just taking what Nature is willing to give,"
robertfrost,Not forcing her hand with harrow and plow.’
robertfrost,‘I wish you had seen his perpetual bow—
robertfrost,"And the air of the youngsters! No one of them turned,"
robertfrost,And they looked so solemn-absurdly concerned.’
robertfrost,1 wish I knew half what the flock of them know
robertfrost,"Of where all the berries and other things grow,"
robertfrost,Cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top
robertfrost,"Of the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they will crop,"
robertfrost,I met them one day and each had a flower
robertfrost,Stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower;
robertfrost,Some strange kind— they told me it hadn’t a name.’
robertfrost,"Tve told you how once not long after we came,"
robertfrost,I almost provoked poor Loren to mirth
robertfrost,By going to him of all people on earth
robertfrost,To ask if he knew any fruit to be had
robertfrost,"For the picking. The rascal, he said he’d be glad"
robertfrost,To tell if he knew. But the year had been bad.
robertfrost,There had been some berries— but those were all gone.
robertfrost,He didn’t say where they had been. He went on:
robertfrost,“I’m sure— I’m sure”— as polite as could be.
robertfrost,"He spoke to his wife in the door, “Let me see,"
robertfrost,"Marne, we don’t know any good berrying place?”"
robertfrost,It was all he could do to keep a straight face.’
robertfrost,"‘If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him,"
robertfrost,"He’ll find he’s mistaken. See here, for a whim."
robertfrost,We’ll pick in the Pattersons’ pasture this year.
robertfrost,"We’ll go in the morning, that is, if it’s dear,"
robertfrost,[ 80 ]
robertfrost,And the sun shines out warm: the vines must be wet.
robertfrost,It’s so long since I picked I almost forget
robertfrost,How we used to pick berries : we took one look rounds
robertfrost,Then sank out of sight like trolls underground.
robertfrost,"And saw nothing more of each other, or heard."
robertfrost,Unless when you said I was keeping a bird
robertfrost,"Away from its nest, and I said it was you."
robertfrost,"“Well, one of us is.” For complaining it flew"
robertfrost,Around and around us. And then for a while
robertfrost,"We picked, till I feared you had wandered a mile,"
robertfrost,And I thought I had lost you. I lifted a shout
robertfrost,"Too loud for the distance you were, it turned out."
robertfrost,"For when you made answer, your voice was as low"
robertfrost,"As talking— you stood up beside me, vou know.’"
robertfrost,'We sha n’t have the place to ourselves to enjoy—
robertfrost,"Not likely, when all the young Lorens deploy."
robertfrost,"They’ll be there tomorrow, or even tonight."
robertfrost,They won’t be too friendly— they may be polite—
robertfrost,To people they look on as having no right
robertfrost,To pick where they’re picking. But we won’t complain.
robertfrost,"You ought to have seen how it looked in the rain,"
robertfrost,"The fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves,"
robertfrost,"Like two kinds of jewels, a vision for thieves.’"
robertfrost,A SERVANT TO SERVANTS
robertfrost,I didn’t make you know how glad I was
robertfrost,To have you come and camp here on our land.
robertfrost,I promised myself to get down some day
robertfrost,"And see the way you lived, but I don’t know!"
robertfrost,With a houseful of hungry men to feed
robertfrost,I guess you’d find. ... It seems to me
robertfrost,I can’t express my feelings any more
robertfrost,Than I can raise my voice or want to lift
robertfrost,"My hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to)."
robertfrost,Did ever you feel so? I hope you never.
robertfrost,It’s got so I don’t even know for sure
robertfrost,"Whether I am glad, sorry, or anything."
robertfrost,There’s nothing but a voice-like left inside
robertfrost,That seems to tell me how I ought to feel.
robertfrost,And would feel if I wasn’t all gone wrong.
robertfrost,You take the lake. I look and look at it.
robertfrost,"I see it’s a fair, pretty sheet of water."
robertfrost,I stand and make myself repeat out loud
robertfrost,"The advantages it has, so long and narrow."
robertfrost,Like a deep piece of some old running river
robertfrost,Cut short off at both ends. It lies five miles
robertfrost,Straight away through the mountain notch
robertfrost,From the sink window where I wash the plates.
robertfrost,"And all our storms come up toward the house,"
robertfrost,Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter.
robertfrost,It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
robertfrost,To step outdoors and take the water dazzle
robertfrost,"A sunny morning, or take the rising wind"
robertfrost,"About my face and body and through my wrapper,"
robertfrost,"When a storm threatened from the Dragon’s Den,"
robertfrost,And a cold chill shivered across the lake.
robertfrost,[ 82 ]
robertfrost,"I see it’s a fair, pretty sheet of water,"
robertfrost,Our Willoughby! How did you hear of it?
robertfrost,"I expect, though, everyone’s heard of it."
robertfrost,In a book about ferns? Listen to that!
robertfrost,You let things more like feathers regulate
robertfrost,Your going and coming. And you like it here?
robertfrost,I can see how you might. But I don’t know!
robertfrost,"It would be different if more people came,"
robertfrost,"For then there would be business. As it is,"
robertfrost,"The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them."
robertfrost,Sometimes we don’t. We’ve a good piece of shore
robertfrost,"That ought to be worth something, and may yet."
robertfrost,But I don’t count on it as much as Len.
robertfrost,He looks on the bright side of everything.
robertfrost,Including me. He thinks I’ll be all right
robertfrost,With doctoring. But it’s not medicine—
robertfrost,Lowe is the only doctor’s dared to say so—
robertfrost,"It’s rest I want— there, I have said it out—"
robertfrost,From cooking meals for hungry hired men
robertfrost,And washing dishes after them— from doing
robertfrost,Things over and over that just won’t stay done.
robertfrost,By good rights I ought not to have so much
robertfrost,"Put on me, but there seems no other way."
robertfrost,Len says one steady pull more ought to do it.
robertfrost,He says the best way out is always through.
robertfrost,"And I agree to that, or in so far"
robertfrost,As that I can see no way out but through—
robertfrost,Leastways for me— and then they’ll be convinced.
robertfrost,It’s not that Len don’t want the best for me.
robertfrost,It was his plan our moving over in
robertfrost,Beside the lake from where that day I showed you
robertfrost,We used to live— ten miles from anywhere.
robertfrost,"We didn’t change without some sacrifice,"
robertfrost,[ 83 ]
robertfrost,But Len went at it to make up the loss.
robertfrost,"His work’s a man’s, df course, from sun to sun."
robertfrost,But he works when he works as hard as I do—
robertfrost,Though there’s small profit in comparisons.
robertfrost,(Women and men will make them all the same.)
robertfrost,But work ain’t all. Len undertakes too much.
robertfrost,He’s into everything in town. This year
robertfrost,"It’s highways, and he’s got too many men"
robertfrost,Around him to look after that make waste.
robertfrost,"They take advantage of him shamefully,"
robertfrost,"And proud, too, of themselves for doing so."
robertfrost,"We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,"
robertfrost,Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
robertfrost,While I fry their bacon. Much they care!
robertfrost,No more put out in what they do or say
robertfrost,Than if I wasn’t in the room at all.
robertfrost,"Coming and going all the time, they are:"
robertfrost,"I don’t learn what their names are, let alone"
robertfrost,"Their characters, or whether they are safe"
robertfrost,To have inside the house with doors unlocked.
robertfrost,"I’m not afraid of them, though, if they’re not"
robertfrost,Afraid of me. There’s two can play at that.
robertfrost,I have my fancies: it runs in the family.
robertfrost,My father’s brother wasn’t right. They kept him
robertfrost,Locked up for years back there at the old farm.
robertfrost,I’ve been away once— yes. I’ve been away.
robertfrost,The State Asylum. I was prejudiced;
robertfrost,I wouldn’t have sent anyone of mine there;
robertfrost,You know the old idea— the only asylum
robertfrost,"Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,"
robertfrost,Rather than send their folks to such a place.
robertfrost,Kept them at home; and it does seem more human.
robertfrost,But it’s not so: the place is the asylum.
robertfrost,[ 84 ]
robertfrost,"There they have every means proper to do with,"
robertfrost,And you aren’t darkening other people’s lives—
robertfrost,"Worse than no good to them, and they no good"
robertfrost,To you in your condition; you can’t know
robertfrost,Affection or the want of it in that state.
robertfrost,I’ve heard too much of the old-fashioned way.
robertfrost,"My father’s brother, he went mad quite young."
robertfrost,"Some thought he had been bitten by a dog,"
robertfrost,Because his violence took on the form
robertfrost,Of carrying his pillow in his teeth;
robertfrost,"But it’s more likely he was crossed in love,"
robertfrost,Or so the story goes. It was some girl.
robertfrost,Anyway all he talked about was love.
robertfrost,They soon saw he would do someone a mischief
robertfrost,"If he wa’n’t kept strict watch of, and it ended"
robertfrost,"In father’s building him a sort of cage,"
robertfrost,"Or room within a room, of hickory poles,"
robertfrost,"Like stanchions in the bam, from floor to ceiling,—"
robertfrost,A narrow passage all the way around.
robertfrost,Anything they put in for furniture
robertfrost,"He’d tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on."
robertfrost,So they made the place comfortable with straw.
robertfrost,"Like a beast’s stall, to ease their consciences."
robertfrost,Of course they had to feed him without dishes.
robertfrost,"They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded"
robertfrost,With his clothes on his arm— all of his clothes.
robertfrost,Cruel— it sounds. I s’pose they did the best
robertfrost,They knew. And just when he was at the height.
robertfrost,"Father and mother married, and mother came,"
robertfrost,"A bride, to help take care of such a creature,"
robertfrost,And accommodate her young life to his.
robertfrost,That was what marrying father meant to her.
robertfrost,She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
robertfrost,[ 85 ]
robertfrost,By his shouts in the night. He’d shout and shout
robertfrost,"Until the strength was shouted out of him,"
robertfrost,And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.
robertfrost,"He’d pull his bars apart like bow and bowstring,"
robertfrost,And let them go and make them twang until
robertfrost,His hands had worn them smooth as any oxbow.
robertfrost,And then he’d crow as if he thought that child’s play
robertfrost,"The only fun he had. I’ve heard them say, though."
robertfrost,They found a way to put a stop to it.
robertfrost,He was before my time— I never saw him ;
robertfrost,But the pen stayed exactly as it was
robertfrost,"There in the upper chamber in the ell,"
robertfrost,A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.
robertfrost,I often think of the smooth hickory bars.
robertfrost,"It got so I would say— you know, half fooling—"
robertfrost,‘It’s time I took my turn upstairs in jail’ —
robertfrost,Just as you will till it becomes a habit.
robertfrost,No wonder I was glad to get away.
robertfrost,"Mind you, I waited till Len said the word."
robertfrost,I didn’t want the blame if things went wrong.
robertfrost,"I was glad though, no end, when we moved out."
robertfrost,"And I looked to be happy, and I was,"
robertfrost,"As I said, for a while— but I don’t know!"
robertfrost,Somehow the change wore out like a prescription.
robertfrost,And there’s more to it than |ust window-views
robertfrost,And living by a lake. I’m past such help—
robertfrost,"Unless Len took the notion, which he won’t."
robertfrost,And I won’t ask him— it’s not sure enough.
robertfrost,I s’pose I’ve got to go the road I’m going:
robertfrost,"Other folks have to, and why shouldn’t I?"
robertfrost,"I almost think if I could do like you,"
robertfrost,Drop everything and live out on the ground—
robertfrost,"But it might be, come night, I shouldn’t like it,"
robertfrost,[ 86 ]
robertfrost,"Or a long rain. I should soon get enough,"
robertfrost,And be glad of a good roof overhead.
robertfrost,"I’ve lain awake thinking of you, 111 warrant."
robertfrost,"More than, you have yourself, some of these nights."
robertfrost,The wonder was the tents weren’t snatched away
robertfrost,From over you as you lay in your beds.
robertfrost,I haven’t courage for a risk like that.
robertfrost,"Bless you, of course, you’re keeping me from work."
robertfrost,"But the thing of it is, I need to be kept."
robertfrost,There’s work enough to do— there’s always that;
robertfrost,But behind’s behind. The worst that you can do
robertfrost,Is set me back a little more behind.
robertfrost,"I sha’n’t catch up in this world, anyway."
robertfrost,I’d rather you’d not go unless you must.

robertfrost,AFTER APPLE-PICKING
robertfrost,My long two-pointed ladder’s sticking through a tree
robertfrost,"Toward heaven still,"
robertfrost,And there’s a barrel that I didn’t fill
robertfrost,"Beside it, and there may be two or three"
robertfrost,Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
robertfrost,But I am done with apple-picking now.
robertfrost,Essence of winter sleep is on the night.
robertfrost,The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
robertfrost,I c ann ot rub the strangeness from my sight
robertfrost,I got from looking through a pane of glass
robertfrost,I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
robertfrost,And held against the world of hoary grass.
robertfrost,"It melted, and I let it fall and break."
robertfrost,But I was well
robertfrost,Upon my way to sleep before it fell.
robertfrost,And I could tell
robertfrost,What form my dreaming was about to take.
robertfrost,Magnified apples appear and disappear.
robertfrost,"Stem end and blossom end,"
robertfrost,And every fleck of russet showing clear.
robertfrost,"My instep arch not only keeps the ache,"
robertfrost,It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
robertfrost,I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.
robertfrost,And I keep hearing from the cellar bin
robertfrost,The rumbling sound
robertfrost,Of load on load of apples coming in.
robertfrost,For I have had too much
robertfrost,Of apple-picking: I am overtired
robertfrost,Of the great harvest I myself desired.
robertfrost,There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch.
robertfrost,"Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall."
robertfrost,[ 88 ]
robertfrost,For all
robertfrost,That struck the earth.
robertfrost,"No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,"
robertfrost,Went surely to the cider-apple heap
robertfrost,As of no worth.
robertfrost,One can see what will trouble
robertfrost,"This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is."
robertfrost,"Were he not gone,"
robertfrost,The woodchuck could say whether it’s like his
robertfrost,"Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,"
robertfrost,Or just some human sleep.
robertfrost,[ 89 ]
robertfrost,THE CODE
robertfrost,There were three in the meadow by the brook
robertfrost,"Gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay."
robertfrost,With an eye always lifted toward the west
robertfrost,Where an irregular sun-bordered cloud
robertfrost,Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger
robertfrost,Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly
robertfrost,"One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground,"
robertfrost,Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed.
robertfrost,The town-bred farmer failed to understand.
robertfrost,“What is there wrong?’
robertfrost,'Something you just now said.’
robertfrost,*What did I say?’
robertfrost,‘About our taking pains.’
robertfrost,‘To cock the hay?— because it’s going to shower?
robertfrost,I said that more than half an hour ago.
robertfrost,I said it to myself as much as you.’
robertfrost,‘You didn’t know. But James is one big fool.
robertfrost,He thought you meant to find fault with his work.
robertfrost,That’s what the average farmer would have meant.
robertfrost,"James would take time, of course, to chew it over"
robertfrost,Before he acted: he’s just got round to act.’
robertfrost,He is a fool if that’s the way he takes me.’
robertfrost,‘Don’t let it bother you. You’ve found out something.
robertfrost,[ 90 ]
robertfrost,The hand that knows his business won’t be told
robertfrost,To do work better or faster— those two things.
robertfrost,I’m as particular as anyone:
robertfrost,Most likely I’d have served you just the same.
robertfrost,But I know you don’t understand our ways.
robertfrost,You were just talking what was in your mind.
robertfrost,"What was in all our minds, and you weren’t hinting."
robertfrost,Tell you a story of what happened once:
robertfrost,I was up here in Salem at a man’s
robertfrost,Named Sanders with a gang of four or five
robertfrost,Doing the haying. No one liked the boss.
robertfrost,He was one of the kind sports call a spider.
robertfrost,All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy
robertfrost,From a humped body nigh as big’s a biscuit
robertfrost,"But work! that man could work, especially"
robertfrost,If by so doing he could get more work
robertfrost,Out of his hired help. I’m not denying
robertfrost,He was hard on himself. I couldn’t find
robertfrost,That he kept any hours— not for himself.
robertfrost,Daylight and lantern-light were one to him:
robertfrost,I’ve heard him pounding in the barn all night.
robertfrost,But what he liked was someone to encourage.
robertfrost,Them that he couldn’t lead he’d get behind
robertfrost,"And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing—"
robertfrost,Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off.
robertfrost,I’d seen about enough of his bulling tricks
robertfrost,(We call that bulling). I’d been watching him.
robertfrost,So when he paired off with me in the hayfield
robertfrost,"To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble."
robertfrost,I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders
robertfrost,"Combed it down with a rake and says, “O.K.”"
robertfrost,Everything went well till we reached the bam
robertfrost,With a big jag to empty in a bay.
robertfrost,[ 91 ]
robertfrost,You understand that meant the easy job
robertfrost,For the man up on top of throwing down
robertfrost,The hay and rolling it off wholesale.
robertfrost,Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting.
robertfrost,You wouldn’t think a fellow’d need much urging
robertfrost,"Under those circumstances, would you now?"
robertfrost,But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands.
robertfrost,"And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,"
robertfrost,"Shouts like an army captain, “Let her come!”"
robertfrost,"Thinks I, D’ye mean it? “What was that you said?”"
robertfrost,"I asked out loud, so’s there’d be no mistake,"
robertfrost,"“Did you say. Let her come?” “Yes, let her come.”"
robertfrost,"He said it over, but he said it softer."
robertfrost,"Never you say a thing like that to a man,"
robertfrost,"Not if he values what he is. God, I’d as soon"
robertfrost,Murdered him as left out his middle name.
robertfrost,I’d built the load and knew right where to find it.
robertfrost,Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for
robertfrost,"Like meditating, and then I just dug in"
robertfrost,And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots.
robertfrost,I looked over the side once in the dust
robertfrost,And caught sight of him treading-water-like.
robertfrost,"Keeping his head above. “Damn ye,” I says,"
robertfrost,“That gets ye!” He squeaked like a squeezed rat
robertfrost,That was the last I saw or heard of him.
robertfrost,I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.
robertfrost,"As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck,"
robertfrost,And sort of waiting to be asked about it.
robertfrost,"One of the boys sings out, “Where’s the old man?”"
robertfrost,“I left him in the bam under the hay.
robertfrost,"If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.”"
robertfrost,They realized from the way I swabbed my neck
robertfrost,More than was needed something must be up.
robertfrost,[ 92 ]
robertfrost,They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was.
robertfrost,"They told me afterward. First they forked hay,"
robertfrost,"A lot of it, out into the barn floor."
robertfrost,Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle.
robertfrost,I guess they thought I’d spiked him in the temple
robertfrost,"Before I buried him, or I couldn’t have managed."
robertfrost,"They excavated more. ""Go keep his wife"
robertfrost,"Out of the bam.” Someone looked in a window,"
robertfrost,And curse me if he wasn’t in the kitchen
robertfrost,"Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet"
robertfrost,"Against the stove, the hottest day that summer."
robertfrost,He looked so clean disgusted from behind
robertfrost,"There was no one that dared to stir him up,"
robertfrost,Or let him know that he was being looked at.
robertfrost,Apparently I hadn’t buried him
robertfrost,(I may have knocked him down); but my just trying
robertfrost,To bury him had hurt his dignity.
robertfrost,He had gone to the house so’s not to meet me.
robertfrost,He kept away from us all afternoon.
robertfrost,We tended to his hay. We saw him out
robertfrost,After a while picking peas in his garden:
robertfrost,He couldn’t keep away from doing something.’
robertfrost,Weren’t you relieved to find he wasn’t dead?’
robertfrost,‘No! and yet I don’t know— it’s hard to say.
robertfrost,I went about to kill him fair enough.’
robertfrost,‘You took an awkward way. Did he discharge you?’
robertfrost,‘Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right’
robertfrost,[93J
robertfrost,THE GENERATIONS OF MEN
robertfrost,"A governor it was proclaimed this time,"
robertfrost,When all who would come seeking in New Hampshire
robertfrost,Ancestral memories might come together.
robertfrost,"And those of the name Stark gathered in Bow,"
robertfrost,"A rock-strewn town where farming has fallen off,"
robertfrost,And sprout-lands flourish where the ax has gone.
robertfrost,Someone had literally run to earth
robertfrost,In an old cellar hole in a by-road
robertfrost,The origin of all the family there.
robertfrost,"Thence they were sprung, so numerous a tribe"
robertfrost,That now not all the houses left in town
robertfrost,Made shift to shelter them without the help
robertfrost,Of here and there a tent in grove and orchard.
robertfrost,"They were at Bow, but that was not enough:"
robertfrost,Nothing would do but they must fix a day
robertfrost,To stand together on the crater’s verge
robertfrost,"That turned them on the world, and try to fathom"
robertfrost,The past and get some strangeness out of it.
robertfrost,"But rain spoiled all. The day began uncertain,"
robertfrost,With clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted.
robertfrost,The young folk held some hope out to each other
robertfrost,Till well toward noon when the storm settled down
robertfrost,With a swish in the grass. What if the others
robertfrost,"Are there,’ they said. Tt isn’t going to rain.’"
robertfrost,Only one from a farm not far away
robertfrost,"Strolled thither, not expecting he would find"
robertfrost,"Anyone else, but out of idleness."
robertfrost,"One, and one other, yes, for there were two."
robertfrost,The second round the curving hillside road
robertfrost,Was a girl; and she halted some way off
robertfrost,"To reconnoiter, and then made up her mind"
robertfrost,[ 94 ]
robertfrost,"At least to pass by and see who he was,"
robertfrost,And perhaps hear some word about the weather.
robertfrost,This was some Stark she didn’t know. He nodded.
robertfrost,"'No fete today,’ he said."
robertfrost,‘It looks that way.’
robertfrost,"She swept the heavens, turning on her heel."
robertfrost,‘I only idled down.’
robertfrost,1 idled down.’
robertfrost,Provision there had been for just such meeting
robertfrost,"Of stranger cousins, in a family tree"
robertfrost,Drawn on a sort of passport with the branch
robertfrost,Of the one bearing it done in detail—
robertfrost,Some zealous one’s laborious device.
robertfrost,"She made a sudden movement toward her bodice,"
robertfrost,As one who clasps her heart. They laughed together.
robertfrost,‘Stark?’ he inquired. ‘No matter for the proof.’
robertfrost,"‘Yes, Stark. And you?’"
robertfrost,‘I’m Stark.’ He drew his passport
robertfrost,“You know we might not be and still be cousins:
robertfrost,"The town is full of Chases, Lowes, and Baileys,"
robertfrost,All claiming some priority in Starkness.
robertfrost,"My mother was a Lane, yet might have married"
robertfrost,Anyone upon earth and still her children
robertfrost,"Would have been Starks, and doubtless here today.’"
robertfrost,*You riddle with your genealogy
robertfrost,Like a Viola. I don’t follow you.’
robertfrost,[ 95 ]
robertfrost,1 only mean my mother was a Stark
robertfrost,"Several times over, and by marrying father"
robertfrost,No more than brought us back into the name.’
robertfrost,‘One ought not to be thrown into confusion
robertfrost,"By a plain statement of relationship,"
robertfrost,But I own what you say makes my head spin.
robertfrost,You take my card— you seem so good at such things
robertfrost,And see if you can reckon our cousinship.
robertfrost,Why not take seats here on the cellar wall
robertfrost,And dangle feet among the raspberry vines?’
robertfrost,‘Under the shelter of the family tree.’
robertfrost,‘Just so— that ought to be enough protection.’
robertfrost,‘Not from the rain. I think it’s going to rain.’
robertfrost,‘It’s raining.’
robertfrost,"‘No, it’s misting; let’s be fair."
robertfrost,Does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes?’
robertfrost,The situation was like this: the road
robertfrost,"Bowed outward on the mountain halfway up,"
robertfrost,And disappeared and ended not far off.
robertfrost,No one went home that way. The only house
robertfrost,Beyond where they were was a shattered seedpod.
robertfrost,"And below roared a brook hidden in trees,"
robertfrost,The sound of which was silence for the place.
robertfrost,This he sat listening to till she gave judgment.
robertfrost,"*On father’s side, it seems, we’re— let me see—’"
robertfrost,[ 96 ]
robertfrost,‘Don’t be too technical.— You have three cards.’
robertfrost,"‘Four cards, one yours, three mine, one for each branch"
robertfrost,Of the Stark family I’m a member of.’
robertfrost,‘D’you know a person so related to herself
robertfrost,Is supposed to be mad.’
robertfrost,‘I may be mad.’
robertfrost,"‘You look so, sitting out here in the rain"
robertfrost,Studying genealogy with me
robertfrost,You never saw before. What will we come to
robertfrost,"With all this pride of ancestry, we Yankees?"
robertfrost,I think we’re all mad. Tell me why we’re here
robertfrost,Drawn into town about this cellar hole
robertfrost,Like wild geese on a lake before a storm?
robertfrost,"What do we see in such a hole, I wonder.’"
robertfrost,"‘The Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc,"
robertfrost,Which means The Seven Caves that We Came out of.
robertfrost,This is the pit from which we Starks were digged.’
robertfrost,“You must be learned. That’s what you see in it?’
robertfrost,‘And what do you see?’
robertfrost,"‘Yes, what do I see?"
robertfrost,First let me look. I see raspberry vines—’
robertfrost,"‘Oh, if you’re going to use your eyes, just hear"
robertfrost,"WTiat I see. It’s a little, little boy,"
robertfrost,As pale and dim as a match flame in the sun;
robertfrost,[ 97 ]
robertfrost,He’s groping in the cellar after jam.
robertfrost,He thinks it’s dark and it’s flooded with daylight.’
robertfrost,‘He’s nothing. Listen. When I lean like this
robertfrost,"I can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly,—"
robertfrost,With his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug—
robertfrost,"Bless you, it isn’t Grandsir Stark, it’s Granny,"
robertfrost,But the pipe’s there and smoking and the jug.
robertfrost,"She’s after cider, the old girl, she’s thirsty;"
robertfrost,Here’s hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely.’
robertfrost,‘Tell me about her. Does she look like me?’
robertfrost,"‘She should, shouldn’t she, you’re so many times"
robertfrost,Over descended from her. I believe
robertfrost,She does look like you. Stay the way you are.
robertfrost,"The nose is just the same, and so’s the chin—"
robertfrost,"Making allowance, making due allowance.’"
robertfrost,"‘You poor, dear, great, great, great, great Granny!’"
robertfrost,‘See that you get her greatness right. Don’t stint her.’
robertfrost,"‘Yes, it’s important, though you think it isn’t."
robertfrost,I won’t be teased. But see bow wet I am.’
robertfrost,"‘Yes, you must go; we can’t stay here for ever."
robertfrost,But wait until I give you a hand up.
robertfrost,A bead of silver water more or less
robertfrost,Strung on your hair won’t hurt your summer looks.
robertfrost,I wanted to try something with the noise
robertfrost,That the brook raises in the empty valley.
robertfrost,We have seen visions— now consult the voices.
robertfrost,[ 98 ]
robertfrost,Something I must have learned riding in trains
robertfrost,When I was young. I used to use the roar
robertfrost,"To set the voices speaking out of it,"
robertfrost,"Speaking or singing, and the band-music playing."
robertfrost,Perhaps you have the art of what I mean.
robertfrost,Ive never listened in among the sounds
robertfrost,That a brook makes in such a wild descent.
robertfrost,It ought to give a purer oracle.’
robertfrost,‘It’s as you throw a picture on a screen:
robertfrost,The meaning of it all is out of you;
robertfrost,The voices give you what you wish to hear.’
robertfrost,"‘Strangely, it’s anything they wish to give.’"
robertfrost,‘Then I don’t know. It must be strange enough.
robertfrost,I wonder if it’s not your make-believe.
robertfrost,What do you think you’re like to hear today?’
robertfrost,‘From the sense of our having been together—
robertfrost,But why take time for what I’m like to hear?
robertfrost,I’ll tell you what the voices really say.
robertfrost,You will do very well right where you are
robertfrost,"A little longer. I mustn’t feel too hurried,"
robertfrost,Or I can’t give myself to hear the voices.’
robertfrost,‘Is this some trance you are withdrawing into?’
robertfrost,“You must be very still; you mustn’t talk.’
robertfrost,Til hardly breathe.’
robertfrost,The voices seem to say—’
robertfrost,[ 99 ]
robertfrost,‘I’m waiting/
robertfrost,‘Don’t! The voices seem to say:
robertfrost,"Call her Nausicaa, the unafraid"
robertfrost,Of an acquaintance made adventurously.’
robertfrost,‘I let you say that— on consideration.’
robertfrost,‘I don’t see very well how you can help it.
robertfrost,You want the truth. I speak but by the voices.
robertfrost,"You see they know I haven’t had your name,"
robertfrost,Though what a name should matter between us—’
robertfrost,‘I shall suspect—’
robertfrost,‘Be good. The voices say:
robertfrost,"Call her Nausicaa, and take a timber"
robertfrost,That you shall find lies in the cellar charred
robertfrost,"Among the raspberries, and hew and shape it"
robertfrost,For a door-sill or other corner piece
robertfrost,In a new cottage on the ancient spot.
robertfrost,The life is not yet all gone out of it.
robertfrost,And come and make your summer dwelling here.
robertfrost,"And perhaps she will come, still unafraid."
robertfrost,And sit before you in the open door
robertfrost,"With flowers in her lap until they fade,"
robertfrost,But not come in across the sacred sill—’
robertfrost,‘I wonder where your oracle is tending.
robertfrost,You can see that there’s something wrong with it.
robertfrost,Or it would speak in dialect. Whose voice
robertfrost,Does it purport to speak in? Not old Grandsir’s
robertfrost,"Nor Granny’s, surely. Call up one of them."
robertfrost,They have best right to be heard in this place.’
robertfrost,[ 100 ]
robertfrost,‘You seem so partial to our great-grandmother
robertfrost,(Nine times removed. Correct me if I err.)
robertfrost,You will be likely to regard as sacred
robertfrost,"Anything she may say. But let me warn you,"
robertfrost,Folks in her day were given to plain speaking.
robertfrost,You think you’d best tempt her at such a time?’
robertfrost,‘It rests with us always to cut her off.’
robertfrost,"'Well then, it’s Granny speaking: “I dunnow!"
robertfrost,Mebbe I’m wrong to take it as I do.
robertfrost,There ain’t no names quite like the old ones though.
robertfrost,Nor never will be to my way of thinking.
robertfrost,One mustn’t bear too hard on the newcomers.
robertfrost,But there’s a dite too many of them for comfort.
robertfrost,I should feel easier if I could see
robertfrost,More of the salt wherewith they’re to be salted.
robertfrost,"Son, you do as you’re told! You take the timber—"
robertfrost,It’s as sound as the day when it was cut—
robertfrost,"And begin over—” There, she’d better stop."
robertfrost,"You can see what is troubling Granny, though."
robertfrost,But don’t you think we sometimes make too much
robertfrost,"Of the old stock? What counts is the ideals,"
robertfrost,And those will bear some keeping still about.’
robertfrost,‘I can see we are going to be good friends.’
robertfrost,‘I like your “going to be.” You said just now
robertfrost,It’s going to rain.’
robertfrost,"‘I know, and it was raining."
robertfrost,I let you say all that. But I must go now.’
robertfrost,[ 101 ]
robertfrost,‘You let me say it? on consideration?
robertfrost,How shall we say good-by in such a case?’
robertfrost,‘How shall we?’
robertfrost,‘Will you leave the way to me?’
robertfrost,"‘No, I don’t trust your eyes. You’ve said enough."
robertfrost,Now give me your hand up— Pick me that flower.’
robertfrost,‘Where shall we meet again?’
robertfrost,‘Nowhere but here
robertfrost,Once more before we meet elsewhere.’
robertfrost,‘In rain?’
robertfrost,It ought to be in rain. Sometime in rain.
robertfrost,"In rain tomorrow, shall we, if it rains?"
robertfrost,"But if we must, in sunshine.’ So she went."
robertfrost,[ 102 ]
robertfrost,THE HOUSEKEEPER
robertfrost,I let myself in at the kitchen door.
robertfrost,"‘It’s you,’ she said. ‘I can’t get up. Forgive me"
robertfrost,Not answering your knock. I can no more
robertfrost,Let people in than I can keep them out.
robertfrost,"I’m getting too old for my size, I tell them."
robertfrost,My fingers are about all Ive the use of
robertfrost,So’s to take any comfort. I can sew:
robertfrost,I help out with this beadwork what I can.’
robertfrost,‘That’s a smart pair of pumps you’re beading there.
robertfrost,Who are they for?’
robertfrost,"‘You mean?— oh, for some miss."
robertfrost,I can’t keep track of other people’s daughters.
robertfrost,"Lord, if I were to dream of everyone"
robertfrost,Whose shoes I primped to dance in!’
robertfrost,‘And where’s John?*
robertfrost,‘Haven’t you seen him? Strange what set you off
robertfrost,To come to his house when he’s gone to yours.
robertfrost,You can’t have passed each other. I know what:
robertfrost,He must have changed his mind and gone to Garland’s.
robertfrost,He won’t be long in that case. You can wait.
robertfrost,"Though what good you can be, or anyone—"
robertfrost,It’s gone so far. You’ve heard? Estelle’s run off.’
robertfrost,"‘Yes, what’s it all about? When did she go?’"
robertfrost,‘Two weeks since.’
robertfrost,"‘She’s in earnest, it appears.’"
robertfrost,[ 103 ]
robertfrost,Tm sure she won’t come back. She’s hiding somewhere.
robertfrost,I don’t know where myself. John thinks I do.
robertfrost,He thinks I only have to say the word.
robertfrost,"And she’ll come back. But, bless you, I’m her mother—"
robertfrost,"I can’t talk to her, and, Lord, if I could!’"
robertfrost,‘It will go hard with John. What will he do?
robertfrost,He can’t find anyone to take her place.’
robertfrost,"! Oh, if you ask me that, what will he do?"
robertfrost,"He gets some sort of bakeshop meals together,"
robertfrost,With me to sit and tell him everything.
robertfrost,What’s wanted and how much and where it is.
robertfrost,But when I’m gone— of course I can’t stay here:
robertfrost,Estelle’s to take me when she’s settled down.
robertfrost,He and I only hinder one another.
robertfrost,"I tell them they can’t get me through the door, though:"
robertfrost,I’ve been built in here like a big church organ.
robertfrost,We’ve been here fifteen years.’
robertfrost,‘That’s a long time
robertfrost,To live together and then pull apart.
robertfrost,How do you see him living when you’re gone?
robertfrost,Two of you out will leave an empty house.’
robertfrost,T don’t just see him living many years.
robertfrost,Left here with nothing but the furniture.
robertfrost,I hate to think of the old place when we’re gone.
robertfrost,With the brook going by below the yard.
robertfrost,And no one here but hens blowing about.
robertfrost,"If he could sell the place, but then, he can’t:"
robertfrost,No one will ever live on it again.
robertfrost,It’s too run down. This is the last of it.
robertfrost,[ 104 ]
robertfrost,"What I think he will do, is let things smash."
robertfrost,He’ll sort of swear the time away. He’s awful!
robertfrost,I never saw a man let family troubles
robertfrost,Make so much difference in his man’s affairs.
robertfrost,He’s just dropped everything. He’s like a child.
robertfrost,I blame his being brought up by his mother.
robertfrost,He’s got hay down that’s been rained on three times.
robertfrost,He hoed a little yesterday for me:
robertfrost,I thought the growing things would do him good.
robertfrost,Something went wrong. I saw him throw the hoe
robertfrost,Sky-high with both hands. I can see it now—
robertfrost,Come here— I’ll show you— in that apple tree.
robertfrost,That’s no way for a man to do at his age:
robertfrost,"He’s fifty-five, you know, if he’s a day.’"
robertfrost,‘Aren’t you afraid of him? What’s that gun for?’
robertfrost,"‘Oh, that’s been there for hawks since chicken-time."
robertfrost,John Hall touch me! Not if he knows his friends.
robertfrost,"I’ll say that for him, John’s no threatener"
robertfrost,Like some menfolk. No one’s afraid of him;
robertfrost,"All is, he’s made up his mind not to stand"
robertfrost,What he has got to stand.’
robertfrost,‘Where is Estelle?
robertfrost,Couldn’t one talk to her? What does she say?
robertfrost,You say you don’t know where she is.’
robertfrost,‘Nor want to!
robertfrost,She thinks if it was bad to live with him.
robertfrost,It must be right to leave him.’
robertfrost,‘Which is wrong!’
robertfrost,[ 105 ]
robertfrost,"‘Yes, but he should have married her.’"
robertfrost,‘I know.’
robertfrost,‘The strain’s been too much for her all these years:
robertfrost,I can’t explain it any other way.
robertfrost,"It’s different with a man, at least with John:"
robertfrost,He knows he’s kinder than the run of men.
robertfrost,Better than married ought to be as good
robertfrost,As married— that’s what he has always said.
robertfrost,I know the way he’s felt— but all the samel’
robertfrost,‘I wonder why he doesn’t marry her
robertfrost,And end it.’
robertfrost,‘Too late now: she wouldn’t have him.
robertfrost,He’s given her time to think of something else.
robertfrost,That’s his mistake. The dear knows my interest
robertfrost,Has been to keep the thing from breaking up.
robertfrost,This is a good home: I don’t ask for better.
robertfrost,"But when I’ve said, “Why shouldn’t they be married,”"
robertfrost,"He’d say, “Why should they?” no more words than that.’"
robertfrost,‘And after all why should they? John’s been fair
robertfrost,I take it. What was his was always hers.
robertfrost,There was no quarrel about property.’
robertfrost,"‘Reason enough, there was no property."
robertfrost,A friend or two as good as own the farm.
robertfrost,Such as it is. It isn’t worth the mortgage.’
robertfrost,‘I mean Estelle has always held the purse.’
robertfrost,[ 106 ]
robertfrost,‘The rights of that are harder to get at.
robertfrost,I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse.
robertfrost,"’Twas we let him have money, not he us."
robertfrost,John’s a bad farmer. I’m not blaming him.
robertfrost,"Take it year in, year out, he doesn’t make much."
robertfrost,"We came here for a home for me, you know,"
robertfrost,Estelle to do the housework for the board
robertfrost,Of both of us. But look how it turns out:
robertfrost,"She seems to have the housework, and besides"
robertfrost,"Half of the outdoor work, though as for that,"
robertfrost,He’d say she does it more because she likes it.
robertfrost,You see our pretty things are all outdoors.
robertfrost,Our hens and cows and pigs are always better
robertfrost,Than folks like us have any business with.
robertfrost,Fanners around twice as well off as we
robertfrost,Haven’t as good. They don’t go with the farm.
robertfrost,"One thing you can’t help liking about John,"
robertfrost,"He’s fond of nice things— too fond, some would :"
robertfrost,But Estelle don’t complain: she’s like him there.
robertfrost,She wants our hens to be the best there are.
robertfrost,You never saw this room before a show.
robertfrost,"Full of lank, shivery, half -drowned birds"
robertfrost,"In separate coops, having their plumage done."
robertfrost,The smell of the wet feathers in the heat!
robertfrost,You spoke of John’s not being safe to stay with.
robertfrost,You don’t know what a gentle lot we are:
robertfrost,We wouldn’t hurt a hen! You ought to see us
robertfrost,Moving a flock of hens from place to place.
robertfrost,"We’re not allowed to take them upside down,"
robertfrost,All we can hold together by the legs.
robertfrost,"Two at a time’s the rule, one on each arm."
robertfrost,No matter how far and how many times
robertfrost,We have to go.’
robertfrost,[ 107 ]
robertfrost,‘You mean that’s John’s idea.’
robertfrost,'And we live up to it; or I don’t know
robertfrost,What childishness he wouldn’t give way to.
robertfrost,He manages to keep the upper hand
robertfrost,On his own farm. He’s boss. But as to hens:
robertfrost,We fence our flowers in and the hens range.
robertfrost,Nothing’s too good for them. We say it pays.
robertfrost,"John likes to tell the offers he has had,"
robertfrost,"Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that."
robertfrost,He never takes the money. If they’re worth
robertfrost,"That much to sell, they’re worth as much to keep."
robertfrost,"Bless you, it’s all expense, though. Reach me down"
robertfrost,The little tin box on the cupboard shelf.
robertfrost,"The upper shelf, the tin box. That’s the one."
robertfrost,I’ll show you. Here you are.’
robertfrost,What’s this?’
robertfrost,‘A bill-
robertfrost,For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock—
robertfrost,Receipted. And the cock is in the yard.’
robertfrost,"‘Not in a glass case, then?’"
robertfrost,‘He’d need a tall one:
robertfrost,He can eat off a barrel from the ground.
robertfrost,"He’s been in a glass case, as you may say."
robertfrost,"The Crystal Palace, London. He’s imported."
robertfrost,"John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads-"
robertfrost,"Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don’t complain."
robertfrost,"But you see, don’t you, we take care of him.’"
robertfrost,[ 108 ]
robertfrost,"‘And like it, too. It makes it all the worse/"
robertfrost,‘It seems as if. And that’s not all: he’s helpless
robertfrost,In ways that I can hardly tell you of.
robertfrost,Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts
robertfrost,To see where all the money goes so fast.
robertfrost,You know how men will be ridiculous.
robertfrost,But it’s just fun the way he gets bedeviled—
robertfrost,"If he’s untidy now, what will he be—?’"
robertfrost,‘It makes it all the worse. You must be blind.’
robertfrost,‘Estelle’s the one. You needn’t talk to me.’
robertfrost,‘Can’t you and I get to the root of it?
robertfrost,What’s the real trouble? What will satisfy her?’
robertfrost,"‘It’s as I say: she’s turned from him, that’s all.’"
robertfrost,"‘But why, when she’s well off? Is it the neighbors,"
robertfrost,Being cut off from friends?’
robertfrost,‘We have our friends.
robertfrost,That isn’t it. Folks aren’t afraid of us/
robertfrost,"‘She’s let it worry her. You stood the strain,"
robertfrost,And you’re her mother.’
robertfrost,‘But I didn’t always.
robertfrost,I didn’t relish it along at first.
robertfrost,But I got wonted to it. And besides—
robertfrost,John said I was too old to have grandchildren.
robertfrost,[ 109 ]
robertfrost,But what’s the use of talking when it’s done?
robertfrost,She won’t come back— it’s worse than that— she can’t.’
robertfrost,‘Why do you speak like that? What do you know?
robertfrost,What do you mean?— she’s done harm to herself?’
robertfrost,1 mean she’s married— married someone else.’
robertfrost,"‘Oho, oho!’"
robertfrost,‘You don’t believe me.’
robertfrost,"‘Yes, I do,"
robertfrost,Only too well. I knew there must be something!
robertfrost,"So that was what was back. She’s bad, that’s all!’"
robertfrost,‘Bad to get married when she had the chance?’
robertfrost,"‘Nonsense! See what she’s done! But who, but who— ’"
robertfrost,‘Who’d marry her straight out of such a mess?
robertfrost,Say it right out— no matter for her mother.
robertfrost,The man was found. I’d better name no names.
robertfrost,John himself won’t imagine who he is.’
robertfrost,“Then it’s all up. I think I’ll get away.
robertfrost,You’ll be expecting John. I pity Estelle;
robertfrost,"I suppose she deserves some pity, too."
robertfrost,You ought to have the kitchen to yourself
robertfrost,To break it to him. You may have the job.’
robertfrost,‘You needn’t think you’re going to get away.
robertfrost,John’s almost here. I’ve had my eye on someone
robertfrost,Coming down Ryan’s Hill. I thought ’twas him.
robertfrost,[ 110 ]
robertfrost,Here he is now. This box! Put it away.
robertfrost,And this bill.’
robertfrost,‘What’s the hurry? He’ll unhitch.’
robertfrost,"‘No, he won’t, either. He’ll just drop the reins"
robertfrost,"And turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all."
robertfrost,She won’t get far before the wheels hang up
robertfrost,"On something— there’s no harm. See, there he is!"
robertfrost,"My, but he looks as if he must have heard!’"
robertfrost,John threw the door wide but he didn’t enter.
robertfrost,"‘How are you, neighbor? Just the man I’m after."
robertfrost,"Isn’t it Hell,’ he said. ‘I want to know."
robertfrost,Come out here if you want to hear me talk.
robertfrost,"I’ll talk to you, old woman, afterward."
robertfrost,I’ve got some news that maybe isn’t news.
robertfrost,"What are they trying to do to me, these two?’"
robertfrost,‘Do go along with him and stop his shouting.’
robertfrost,She raised her voice against the closing door:
robertfrost,"“Who wants to hear your news, you— dreadful fool?’"
robertfrost,[Ill]
robertfrost,THE FEAR
robertfrost,A lantern light from deeper in the barn
robertfrost,Shone on a man and woman in the door
robertfrost,And threw their lurching shadows on a house
robertfrost,"Nearby, all dark in every glossy window."
robertfrost,A horse’s hoof pawed once the hollow floor.
robertfrost,And the back of the gig they stood beside
robertfrost,Moved in a little. The man grasped a wheel.
robertfrost,"The woman spoke out sharply, ‘Whoa, stand still!"
robertfrost,"I saw it just as plain as a white plate,’"
robertfrost,"She said, ‘as the light on the dashboard ran"
robertfrost,"Along the bushes at the roadside— a man’s face,"
robertfrost,You must have seen it too.’
robertfrost,Are you sure—’
robertfrost,‘I didn’t see it.
robertfrost,"‘Yes, I’m sure!’"
robertfrost,‘—it was a face?’
robertfrost,"‘Joel, I’ll have to look. I can’t go in,"
robertfrost,"I can’t, and leave a thing like that unsettled."
robertfrost,Doors locked and curtains drawn will make no difference.
robertfrost,I always have felt strange when we came home
robertfrost,To the dark house after so long an absence.
robertfrost,And the key rattled loudly into place
robertfrost,Seemed to warn someone to be getting out
robertfrost,At one door as we entered at another.
robertfrost,"What if I’m right, and someone all the time—"
robertfrost,Don’t hold my arm!’
robertfrost,[ 112 ]
robertfrost,'I say it’s someone passing.’
robertfrost,Tou speak as if this were a traveled road.
robertfrost,You forget where we are. What is beyond
robertfrost,That he’d be going to or coming from
robertfrost,"At such an hour of night, and on foot too?"
robertfrost,What was he standing still for in the bushes?’
robertfrost,'It’s not so very late— it’s only dark.
robertfrost,There’s more in it than you’re inclined to say.
robertfrost,Did he look like—?’
robertfrost,‘He looked like anyone.
robertfrost,I’ll never rest tonight unless I know.
robertfrost,Give me the lantern.’
robertfrost,'You don’t want the lantern.’
robertfrost,She pushed past him and got it for herself.
robertfrost,"‘You’re not to come,’ she said. ‘This is my business"
robertfrost,If the time’s come to face it. I’m the one
robertfrost,To put it the right way. He’d never dare—
robertfrost,"Listen! He kicked a stone. Hear that, hear that!"
robertfrost,"He’s coming towards us. Joel, go in— please."
robertfrost,Hark!— I don’t hear him now. But please go in.’
robertfrost,Tn the first place vou can’t make me believe it's—
robertfrost,‘It is— or someone else he’s sent to watch.
robertfrost,And now’s the time to have it out with him
robertfrost,While we know definitely where he is.
robertfrost,Let him get off and he’ll be everywhere
robertfrost,[ 113 ]
robertfrost,"Around us, looking out of trees and bushes"
robertfrost,Till I sha n’t dare to set a foot outdoors.
robertfrost,"And I can’t stand it. Joel, let me go!’"
robertfrost,'But it’s nonsense to think he’d care enough.’
robertfrost,“You mean you couldn’t understand his caring.
robertfrost,"Oh, but you see he hadn’t had enough—"
robertfrost,"Joel, I won’t— I won’t— I promise you."
robertfrost,We mustn’t say hard things. You mustn’t either.’
robertfrost,"Til be the one, if anybody goes!"
robertfrost,But you give him the advantage with this light.
robertfrost,What couldn’t he do to us standing here!
robertfrost,"And if to see was what he wanted, why,"
robertfrost,He has seen all there was to see and gone.’
robertfrost,"He appeared to forget to keep his hold,"
robertfrost,But advanced with her as she crossed the grass.
robertfrost,What do you want?’ she cried to all the dark.
robertfrost,She stretched up tall to overlook the light
robertfrost,That hung in both hands hot against her skirt.
robertfrost,"There’s no one; so you’re wrong,’ he said."
robertfrost,‘There is.—
robertfrost,"What do you want?’ she cried, and then herself"
robertfrost,Was startled when an answer really came.
robertfrost,‘Nothing.’ It came from well along the road.
robertfrost,She reached a hand to Joel for support:
robertfrost,The smell of scorching woolen made her faint.
robertfrost,[ 114 ]
robertfrost,“What are you doing round this house at night?’
robertfrost,‘Nothing.’ A pause: there seemed no more to say.
robertfrost,And then the voice again: “You seem afraid.
robertfrost,I saw by the way you whipped up the horse.
robertfrost,I’ll just come forward in the lantern light
robertfrost,And let you see.’
robertfrost,"■Yes, do.— Joel, go back!’"
robertfrost,She stood her ground against the noisy steps
robertfrost,"That came on, but her body rocked a little."
robertfrost,"You see,’ the voice said."
robertfrost,‘Oh.’ She looked and looked.
robertfrost,You don’t see— I’ve a child here by the hand.
robertfrost,A robber wouldn’t have his family with him.’
robertfrost,‘What’s a child doing at this time of night—?’
robertfrost,‘Out walking. Every child should have the memory
robertfrost,Of at least one long-after-bedtime walk.
robertfrost,"What, son?’"
robertfrost,Then I should think you’d try to find
robertfrost,Somewhere to walk—’
robertfrost,"‘The highway, as it happens—"
robertfrost,We’re stopping for the fortnight down at Dean’s.’
robertfrost,[ 115 ]
robertfrost,‘But if that’s all— Joel— you realize—
robertfrost,You won’t think anything. You understand?
robertfrost,You understand that we have to be careful.
robertfrost,"This is a very, very lonely place."
robertfrost,Joel!’ She spoke as if she couldn’t turn.
robertfrost,The swinging lantern lengthened to the ground.
robertfrost,"It touched, it struck, it clattered and went out."
robertfrost,[ 116 ]
robertfrost,THE SELF-SEEKER
robertfrost,"‘Willis, I didn’t want you here today:"
robertfrost,The lawyer’s coining for the company.
robertfrost,"I’m going to sell my soul, or, rather, feet."
robertfrost,"Five hundred dollars for the pair, you know.’"
robertfrost,With you the feet have nearly been the soul;
robertfrost,"And if you’re going to sell them to the devil,"
robertfrost,I want to see you do it. When’s he coming?’
robertfrost,"‘I half suspect you knew, and came on purpose"
robertfrost,To try to help me drive a better bargain.’
robertfrost,"Well, if it’s true! Yours are no common feet."
robertfrost,The lawyer don’t know what it is he’s buying:
robertfrost,So many miles you might have walked you won’t walk.
robertfrost,You haven’t run your forty orchids down.
robertfrost,What does he think?— How are the blessed feet?
robertfrost,The doctor’s sure you’re going to walk again?’
robertfrost,‘He thinks 111 hobble. It’s both legs and feet.’
robertfrost,They must be terrible— I mean to look at.’
robertfrost,1 haven’t dared to look at them uncovered.
robertfrost,Through the bed blankets I remind myself
robertfrost,Of a starfish laid out with rigid points.’
robertfrost,‘The wonder is it hadn’t been your head.’
robertfrost,‘It’s hard to tell you how I managed it.
robertfrost,"When I saw the shaft had me by the coat,"
robertfrost,[117]
robertfrost,I didn’t try too long to pull away.
robertfrost,"Or fumble for my knife to cut away,"
robertfrost,I just embraced the shaft and rode it out—
robertfrost,Till Weiss shut off the water in the wheel-pit.
robertfrost,That’s how I think I didn’t lose my head.
robertfrost,But my legs got their knocks against the ceiling.’
robertfrost,‘Awful. Why didn’t they throw off the belt
robertfrost,Instead of going clear down in the wheel-pit?’
robertfrost,‘They say some time was wasted on the belt—
robertfrost,Old streak of leather— doesn’t love me much
robertfrost,"Because I make him spit fire at my knuckles,"
robertfrost,The way Ben Franklin used to make the kite-string.
robertfrost,That must be it. Some days he won’t stay on.
robertfrost,That day a woman couldn’t coax him off.
robertfrost,He’s on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth
robertfrost,Snatched right and left across the silver pulleys.
robertfrost,Everything goes the same without me there.
robertfrost,"You can hear the small buzz saws whine, the big saw"
robertfrost,Caterwaul to the hills around the village
robertfrost,As they both bite the wood. It’s all our music.
robertfrost,One ought as a good villager to like it.
robertfrost,"No doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound,"
robertfrost,And it’s our life.’
robertfrost,"“Yes, when it’s not our death.’"
robertfrost,You make that sound as if it wasn’t so
robertfrost,With everything. What we live by we die by.
robertfrost,I wonder where my lawyer is. His train’s in.
robertfrost,I want this over with; I’m hot and tired.’
robertfrost,‘You’re getting ready to do something foolish.’
robertfrost,[ 118 ]
robertfrost,"Watch for him, will you. Will? You let him in."
robertfrost,I’d rather Mrs. Corbin didn’t know;
robertfrost,"I’ve boarded here so long, she thinks she owns me."
robertfrost,You’re bad enough to manage without her.’
robertfrost,Tm going to be worse instead of better.
robertfrost,You’ve got to tell me how far this is gone:
robertfrost,Have you agreed to any price?’
robertfrost,'Five hundred.
robertfrost,"Five hundred— five— five! One, two, three, four, five."
robertfrost,You needn’t look at me.’
robertfrost,‘I don’t believe you.’
robertfrost,"1 told you, Willis, when you first came in."
robertfrost,Don’t you be hard on me. I have to take
robertfrost,"What I can get. You see they have the feet,"
robertfrost,Which gives them the advantage in the trade.
robertfrost,I can’t get back the feet in any case.’
robertfrost,"'But your flowers, man, you’re selling out your flowers.’"
robertfrost,"Tes, that’s one way to put it— all the flowers"
robertfrost,Of every kind everywhere in this region
robertfrost,For the next forty summers— call it forty.
robertfrost,"But I’m not selling those, I’m giving them."
robertfrost,They never earned me so much as one cent:
robertfrost,Money can’t pay me for the loss of them.
robertfrost,"No, the five hundred was the sum they named"
robertfrost,To pay the doctor’s bill and tide me over.
robertfrost,"It’s that or fight, and I don’t want to fight—"
robertfrost,"I just want to get settled in my life,"
robertfrost,[ 119 ]
robertfrost,"Such as it’s going to be, and know the worst,"
robertfrost,Or best— it may not be so bad. The firm
robertfrost,Promise me all the shooks I want to nail.’
robertfrost,‘But what about your flora of the valley?’
robertfrost,“You have me there. But that— you didn’t think
robertfrost,That was worth money to me? Still I own
robertfrost,It goes against me not to finish it
robertfrost,"For the friends it might bring me. By the way,"
robertfrost,I had a letter from Burroughs— did I tell you?—
robertfrost,About my Cyprepedium regime;
robertfrost,He says it’s not reported so far north.
robertfrost,There! there’s the bell. He’s rung. But you go down
robertfrost,"And bring him up, and don’t let Mrs. Corbin.—"
robertfrost,"Oh, well, we’ll soon be through with it. I’m tired.’"
robertfrost,Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer
robertfrost,A little barefoot girl who in the noise
robertfrost,Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house.
robertfrost,"And baritone importance of the lawyer,"
robertfrost,Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands
robertfrost,Shyly behind her.
robertfrost,"“Well, and how is Mister—"
robertfrost,The lawyer was already in his satchel
robertfrost,As if for papers that might bear the name
robertfrost,"He hadn’t at command. ‘You must excuse me,"
robertfrost,I dropped in at the mill and was detained.’
robertfrost,"‘Looking round, I suppose,’ said Willis."
robertfrost,"‘Yes,"
robertfrost,"Well, yes.’"
robertfrost,[ 120 ]
robertfrost,‘Hear anything that might prove useful?’
robertfrost,"The Broken One saw Anne. “Why, here is Anne."
robertfrost,"What do you want, dear? Come, stand by the bed;"
robertfrost,Tell me what is it?’ Anne just wagged her dress
robertfrost,"With both hands held behind her. ‘Guess,’ she said."
robertfrost,"‘Oh, guess which hand? My, my! Once on a time"
robertfrost,I knew a lovely way to tell for certain
robertfrost,By looking in the ears. But I forget it.
robertfrost,"Er, let me see. I think I’ll take the right."
robertfrost,That’s sure to be right even if it’s wrong.
robertfrost,"Come, hold it out. Don’t change.— A Ram’s Hom orchid!"
robertfrost,"A Ram’s Hom! What would I have got, I wonder,"
robertfrost,If I had chosen left. Hold out the left.
robertfrost,Another Ram’s Hom! Where did you find those.
robertfrost,"Under what beech tree, on what woodchuck’s knoll?’"
robertfrost,Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side.
robertfrost,And thought she wouldn’t venture on so much.
robertfrost,“Were there no others?’
robertfrost,‘There were four or five.
robertfrost,I knew you wouldn’t let me pick them all.’
robertfrost,‘I wouldn’t— so I wouldn’t. You’re the girl!
robertfrost,You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart.’
robertfrost,‘I wanted there should be some there next year.’
robertfrost,"‘Of course you did. You left the rest for seed,"
robertfrost,And for the backwoods woodchuck. You’re the girl!
robertfrost,A Ram’s Hom orchid seedpod for a woodchuck
robertfrost,£ 121 ]
robertfrost,Sounds something like. Better than farmer’s beans
robertfrost,"To a discriminating appetite,"
robertfrost,Though the Ham’s Horn is seldom to be had
robertfrost,In bushel lots— doesn’t come on the market.
robertfrost,"But, Anne, I’m troubled; have you told me all?"
robertfrost,You’re hiding something. That’s as bad as lying.
robertfrost,You ask this lawyer man. And it’s not safe
robertfrost,With a lawyer at hand to find you out.
robertfrost,"Nothing is hidden from some people, Anne."
robertfrost,You don’t tell me that where you found a Ram’s Horn
robertfrost,You didn’t find a Yellow Lady’s Slipper.
robertfrost,"What did I tell you? What? I’d blush, I would."
robertfrost,"Don’t you defend yourself. If it was there,"
robertfrost,"Where is it now, the Yellow Lady’s Slipper?’"
robertfrost,"Well, wait— it’s common— it’s too common.’"
robertfrost,‘Common?
robertfrost,The Purple Lady’s Slipper’s commoner.’
robertfrost,‘I didn’t bring a Purple Lady’s Slipper.
robertfrost,To You — to you I mean— they’re both too common.'
robertfrost,The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers
robertfrost,As if with some idea that she had scored.
robertfrost,Tve broken Anne of gathering bouquets.
robertfrost,It’s not fair to the child. It can’t be helped though:
robertfrost,Pressed into service means pressed out of shape.
robertfrost,Somehow I’ll make it right with her— she’ll see.
robertfrost,"She’s going to do my scouting in the field,"
robertfrost,Over stone walls and all along a wood
robertfrost,And by a river bank for water flowers.
robertfrost,"The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart,"
robertfrost,[ 122 ]
robertfrost,And at the sinus under water a fist
robertfrost,Of little fingers all kept down but one.
robertfrost,And that thrust up to blossom in the sun
robertfrost,"As if to say, “You! You’re the Heart’s desire.”"
robertfrost,Anne has a way with flowers to take the place
robertfrost,Of what she’s lost: she goes down on one knee
robertfrost,And lifts their faces by the chin to hers
robertfrost,"And says their names, and leaves them where they are.’"
robertfrost,The lawyer wore a watch the case of which
robertfrost,Was cunningly devised to make a noise
robertfrost,Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut
robertfrost,At such a time as this. He snapped it now.
robertfrost,"Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait."
robertfrost,The lawyer man is thinking of his train.
robertfrost,He wants to give me lots and lots of money
robertfrost,"Before he goes, because I hurt myself,"
robertfrost,And it may take him I don’t know how long.
robertfrost,"But put our flowers in water first. Will, help her:"
robertfrost,The pitcher’s too full for her. There’s no cup?
robertfrost,Just hook them on the inside of the pitcher.
robertfrost,Now run.— Get out your documents! You see
robertfrost,I have to keep on the good side of Anne.
robertfrost,I’m a great boy to think of number one.
robertfrost,And you can’t blame me in the place I’m in.
robertfrost,Who will take care of my necessities
robertfrost,Unless I do?’
robertfrost,"‘A pretty interlude,’"
robertfrost,"The lawyer said. ‘I’m sorry, but my train—"
robertfrost,Luckily terms are all agreed upon.
robertfrost,You only have to sign your name. Bight— there.’
robertfrost,[ 123 ]
robertfrost,"‘You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here"
robertfrost,Where you can’t make them. What is it you want?
robertfrost,I’ll put you out with Anne. Be good or go.’
robertfrost,‘You don’t mean you will sign that thing unread?’
robertfrost,"‘Make yourself useful then, and read it for me."
robertfrost,Isn’t it something I have seen before?’
robertfrost,‘You’ll find it is. Let your friend look at it.’
robertfrost,"‘Yes, but all that takes time, and I’m as much"
robertfrost,In haste to get it over with as you.
robertfrost,"But read it, read it. That’s right, draw the curtain:"
robertfrost,Half the time I don’t know what’s troubling me.—
robertfrost,What do you say. Will? Don’t you be a fool.
robertfrost,"You, crumpling folks’s legal documents."
robertfrost,Out with it if you’ve any real objection.’
robertfrost,‘Five hundred dollars!’
robertfrost,What would you think right?*
robertfrost,‘A thousand wouldn’t be a cent too much;
robertfrost,"You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is"
robertfrost,Accepting anything before he knows
robertfrost,Whether he’s ever going to walk again.
robertfrost,It smells to me like a dishonest trick.’
robertfrost,‘I think— I think— from what I heard today—
robertfrost,And saw myself— he would be ill-advised—’
robertfrost,"What did you hear, for instance?’ Willis said."
robertfrost,[ 124 ]

robertfrost,The Broken One was twisted in his bed.

robertfrost,One of you hold my head up from the pillow.’

robertfrost,‘You’re doing the wise thing: you won’t regret it.
robertfrost,We’re very sorry for you.’
robertfrost,Willis sneered:
robertfrost,‘Who’s weP— some stockholders in Boston?
robertfrost,"I’ll go outdoors, by gad, and won’t come back.’"
robertfrost,"‘Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come."
robertfrost,Yes. Thanks for caring. Don’t mind Will: he’s savage.

robertfrost,THE WOOD-PILE
robertfrost,"Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day,"
robertfrost,"I paused and said, T will ton back from here."
robertfrost,"No, I will go on farther— and we shall see.’"
robertfrost,"The hard snow held me, save where now and then"
robertfrost,One foot went through. The view was all in lines
robertfrost,Straight up and down of tall slim trees
robertfrost,Too much alike to mark or name a place by
robertfrost,So as to say for certain I was here
robertfrost,Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.
robertfrost,A small bird flew before me. He was careful
robertfrost,To put a tree between us when he lighted.
robertfrost,And say no word to tell me who he was
robertfrost,Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.
robertfrost,He thought that I was after him for a feather—
robertfrost,The white one in his tail; like one who takes
robertfrost,Everything said as personal to himself.
robertfrost,One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.
robertfrost,And then there was a pile of wood for which
robertfrost,I forgot him and let his little fear
robertfrost,"Carry him off the way I might have gone,"
robertfrost,Without so much as wishing him good-night.
robertfrost,He went behind it to make his last stand.
robertfrost,"It was a cord of maple, cut and split"
robertfrost,"And piled— and measured, four by four by eight."
robertfrost,And not another like it could I see.
robertfrost,No runner tracks in this year’s snow looped near it.
robertfrost,And it was older sure than this year’s cutting.
robertfrost,Or even last year’s or the year’s before.
robertfrost,The wood was gray and the bark warping off it
robertfrost,And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis
robertfrost,Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.
robertfrost,[ 126 ]
robertfrost,What held it though on one side was a tree
robertfrost,"Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,"
robertfrost,These latter about to fall. I thought that only
robertfrost,Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
robertfrost,Could so forget his handiwork on which
robertfrost,"He spent himself, the labor of his ax,"
robertfrost,And leave it there far from a useful fireplace
robertfrost,To warm the frozen swamp as best it could
robertfrost,With the slow smokeless burning of decay.

robertfrost,GOOD HOURS
robertfrost,I had for my winter evening walk—
robertfrost,"No one at all with whom to talk,"
robertfrost,But I had the cottages in a row
robertfrost,Up to their shining eyes in snow.
robertfrost,And I thought I had the folk within:
robertfrost,I had the sound of a violin;
robertfrost,I had a glimpse through curtain laces
robertfrost,Of youthful forms and youthful faces.
robertfrost,I had such company outward bound.
robertfrost,I went till there were no cottages found.
robertfrost,"I tinned and repented, but coming back"
robertfrost,I saw no window but that was black.
robertfrost,Over the snow my creaking feet
robertfrost,Disturbed the slumbering village street
robertfrost,"Like profanation, by your leave."
robertfrost,At ten o’clock of a winter eve.

robertfrost,THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
robertfrost,Two roads diverged in a yellow wood.
robertfrost,And sorry I could not travel both
robertfrost,"And be one traveler, long I stood"
robertfrost,And looked down one as far as I could
robertfrost,To where it bent in the undergrowth;
robertfrost,"Then took the other, as just as fair."
robertfrost,"And having perhaps the better claim,"
robertfrost,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
robertfrost,Though as for that the passing there
robertfrost,Had worn them really about the same.
robertfrost,And both that morning equally lay
robertfrost,In leaves no step had trodden black.
robertfrost,"Oh, I kept the first for another day!"
robertfrost,"Yet knowing how way leads on to way,"
robertfrost,I doubted if I should ever come back.
robertfrost,I shall be telling this with a sigh
robertfrost,Somewhere ages and ages hence:
robertfrost,"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—"
robertfrost,"I took the one less traveled by,"
robertfrost,And that has made all the difference.

robertfrost,A CHRISTMAS CIRCULAR LETTER
robertfrost,The city had withdrawn into itself
robertfrost,And left at last the country to the country;
robertfrost,When between whirls of snow not come to lie
robertfrost,"And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove"
robertfrost,"A stranger to our yard, who looked the city,"
robertfrost,Yet did in country fashion in that there
robertfrost,He sat and waited till he drew us out
robertfrost,A -butto nin g coats to ask him who he was.
robertfrost,He proved to be the city come again
robertfrost,To look for something it had left behind
robertfrost,And could not do without and keep its Christmas.
robertfrost,He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;
robertfrost,My woods— the young fir balsams like a place
robertfrost,Where houses all are churches and have spires.
robertfrost,I hadn’t thought of them as Christmas trees.
robertfrost,I doubt if I was tempted for a moment
robertfrost,To sell them off their feet to go in cars
robertfrost,And leave the slope behind the house all bare.
robertfrost,Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.
robertfrost,I’d hate to have them know it if I was.
robertfrost,Yet more I’d hate to hold my trees except
robertfrost,"As others hold theirs or refuse for them,"
robertfrost,Beyond the time of profitable growth.
robertfrost,The trial by market everything must come to.
robertfrost,I dallied so much with the thought of selling.
robertfrost,Then whether from mistaken courtesy
robertfrost,"And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether"
robertfrost,"From hope of hearing good of what was mine,"
robertfrost,"I said, ‘There aren’t enough to be worth while.’"
robertfrost,[ 132 ]
robertfrost,"1 could soon tell how many they would cut,"
robertfrost,You let me look them over/
robertfrost,‘You could look.
robertfrost,But don’t expect I’m going to let you have them.’
robertfrost,"Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close"
robertfrost,"That lop each other of boughs, but not a few"
robertfrost,Quite solitary and having equal boughs
robertfrost,All round and round. The latter he nodded ‘Yes’ to.
robertfrost,Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one.
robertfrost,"With a buyer’s moderation, ‘That would do.’"
robertfrost,"I thought so too, but wasn’t there to say so."
robertfrost,"We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over."
robertfrost,And came down on the north.
robertfrost,"He said, ‘A thousand/"
robertfrost,‘A thousand Christmas trees!— at what apiece?’
robertfrost,He felt some need of softening that to me:
robertfrost,‘A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.’
robertfrost,Then I was certain I had never meant
robertfrost,To let him have them. Never show surprise!
robertfrost,But thirty dollars seemed so small beside
robertfrost,"The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents"
robertfrost,"(For that was all they figured out apiece),"
robertfrost,Three cents so small beside the dollar friends
robertfrost,I should be writing to within the hour
robertfrost,"Would pay in cities for good trees like those,"
robertfrost,Regular vestry trees whole Sunday Schools
robertfrost,Could hang enough on to pick off enough.
robertfrost,[ 133 ]
robertfrost,A thousand Christmas trees I didn’t know I hadl
robertfrost,Worth three cents more to give away than sell
robertfrost,As may be shown by a simple calculation.
robertfrost,Too bad I couldn’t lay one in a letter.
robertfrost,I can’t help wishing I could send you one
robertfrost,In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.

robertfrost,AN OLD MAN’S WINTER NIGHT
robertfrost,All out-of-doors looked darkly in at him
robertfrost,"Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars."
robertfrost,That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.
robertfrost,What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
robertfrost,Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.
robertfrost,What kept him from remembering what it was
robertfrost,That brought him to that creaking room was age.
robertfrost,He stood with barrels round him— at a loss.
robertfrost,And having scared the cellar under him
robertfrost,"In clomping here, he scared it once again"
robertfrost,In clomping off;— and scared the outer night.
robertfrost,"Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar"
robertfrost,"Of trees and crack of branches, common things."
robertfrost,But nothing so like beating on a box.
robertfrost,A light he was to no one but himself
robertfrost,"Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,"
robertfrost,"A quiet light, and then not even that."
robertfrost,"He consigned to the moon, such as she was,"
robertfrost,"So late-arising, to the broken moon"
robertfrost,As better than the sun in any case
robertfrost,"For such a charge, his snow upon the roof,"
robertfrost,His icicles along the wall to keep;
robertfrost,And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt
robertfrost,"Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted."
robertfrost,"And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept."
robertfrost,"One aged man— one man— can’t keep a house,"
robertfrost,"A farm, a countryside, or if he can,"
robertfrost,It’s thus he does it of a winter night.
robertfrost,[135J
robertfrost,"""the exposed nest"
robertfrost,You were forever finding some new play.
robertfrost,So when I saw you down on hands and knees
robertfrost,"In the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay."
robertfrost,"Trying, I thought, to set it up on end,"
robertfrost,I went to show you how to make it stay.
robertfrost,"If that was your idea, against the breeze."
robertfrost,"And, if you asked me, even help pretend"
robertfrost,To make it root again and grow afresh.
robertfrost,But ’twas no make-believe with you today.
robertfrost,Nor was the grass itself your real concern.
robertfrost,"Though I found your hand full of wilted fern,"
robertfrost,"Steel'bright June-grass, and blackening heads of clover."
robertfrost,’Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground
robertfrost,The cutter-bar had just gone champing over

robertfrost,And left defenseless to the heat and light.

robertfrost,Of something interposed between their sight
robertfrost,And too much world at once— could means be found.
robertfrost,The way the nest-full every time we stirred

robertfrost,Whose coming home has been too long deferred.
robertfrost,Made mo ask would the mother-bird return
robertfrost,And care for them in such a change of scene

robertfrost,That was a thing we could not wait to learn.

robertfrost,But dared not spare to do the best we could
robertfrost,Though harm should come of it; so built the screen
robertfrost,"You had begun, and gave them back their shade."
robertfrost,All this to prove we cared. Why is there then
robertfrost,[ 136 ]

robertfrost,"She stood against the kitchen sink, and looked"
robertfrost,Over the sink out through a dusty window
robertfrost,At weeds the water from the sink made tall.
robertfrost,She wore her cape; her hat was in her hand.
robertfrost,"Behind her was confusion in the room,"
robertfrost,Of chairs turned upside down to sit like people
robertfrost,"In other chairs, and something, come to look."
robertfrost,"For every room a house has— parlor, bedroom,"
robertfrost,And dining room— thrown pell-mell in the kitchen.
robertfrost,"And now and then a smudged, infernal face"
robertfrost,Looked in a door behind her and addressed
robertfrost,Her back. She always answered without turning.
robertfrost,"“Where will 1 put this walnut bureau, lady?'"
robertfrost,Tut it on top of something that’s on top
robertfrost,"Of something else/ she laughed. “Oh, put it where"
robertfrost,"You can tonight, and go. It’s almost dark;"
robertfrost,You must be getting started back to town.’
robertfrost,Another blackened face thrust in and looked
robertfrost,"And smiled, and when she did not turn, spoke gently,"
robertfrost,"“What are you seeing out the window, lady?’"
robertfrost,‘Never was I beladied so before.
robertfrost,Would evidence of having been called lady
robertfrost,More than so many times make me a lady
robertfrost,"In common law, I wonder/"
robertfrost,"‘But I ask,"
robertfrost,"What are you seeing out the window, lady?’"
robertfrost,“What I’ll be seeing more of in the years
robertfrost,To come as here I stand and go the round
robertfrost,[ 139 ]
robertfrost,Of many plates with towels many times.’
robertfrost,‘And what is that? You only put me off.’
robertfrost,‘Rank weeds that love the water from the dishpan
robertfrost,"More than some women like the dishpan, Joe;"
robertfrost,A little stretch of mowing-field for you;
robertfrost,Not much of that until I come to woods
robertfrost,That end all. And it’s scarce enough to call
robertfrost,A view.’
robertfrost,"‘And yet you think you like it, dear?’"
robertfrost,‘That’s what you’re so concerned to know! You hope
robertfrost,I like it. Bang goes something big away
robertfrost,Off there upstairs. The very tread of men
robertfrost,As great as those is shattering to the frame
robertfrost,Of such a little house. Once left alone.
robertfrost,"You and I, dear, wifi go with softer steps"
robertfrost,"Up and down stairs and through the rooms, and none"
robertfrost,But sudden winds that snatch them from our hands
robertfrost,Will ever slam the doors.’
robertfrost,‘I think you see
robertfrost,More than you like to own to out that window.’

robertfrost,I only see the years. They come and go

robertfrost,The wood.’
robertfrost,“What kind of years?’
robertfrost,[ 140 ]

robertfrost,Different from early years.’
robertfrost,"'I see them, too."
robertfrost,You didn’t count them?’
robertfrost,"‘No, the further off"
robertfrost,So ran together that I didn’t try to.
robertfrost,It can scarce be that they would be in number
robertfrost,"We’d care to know, for we are not young now."
robertfrost,And bang goes something else away off there.
robertfrost,It sounds as if it were the men went down.
robertfrost,And every crash meant one less to return
robertfrost,"To lighted city streets we, too, have known,"
robertfrost,But now are giving up for country darkness.’
robertfrost,‘Come from that window where you see too much.
robertfrost,And take a livelier view of things from here.
robertfrost,They’re going. Watch this husky swarming up
robertfrost,Over the wheel into the sky-high seat.
robertfrost,"Lighting his pipe now, squinting down his nose"
robertfrost,At the flame binning downward as he sucks it.’
robertfrost,"‘See how it makes his nose-side bright, a proof"
robertfrost,How dark it’s getting. Can you tell what time
robertfrost,It is by that? Or by the moon? The new moon!
robertfrost,What shoulder did I see her over? Neither.
robertfrost,"A wire she is of silver, as new as we"
robertfrost,To everything. Her light won’t last us long.
robertfrost,"It’s something, though, to know were going to have her"
robertfrost,Night after night and stronger every night
robertfrost,"To see us through our first two weeks. But, Joe,"
robertfrost,The stove! Before they go! Knock on the window;

robertfrost,‘We’ve got to have the stove.
robertfrost,Whatever else we want for. And a light.
robertfrost,Have we a piece of candle if the lamp
robertfrost,And oil are buried out of reach?’
robertfrost,Again
robertfrost,"The house was full of tramping, and the dark."
robertfrost,Door-filling men burst in and seized the stove.
robertfrost,A cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall.
robertfrost,To which they set it true by eye; and then
robertfrost,Came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands.
robertfrost,So much too light and airy for their strength
robertfrost,"It almost seemed to come ballooning up,"
robertfrost,Slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling.
robertfrost,"‘A fit!’ said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder."
robertfrost,‘It’s good luck when you move in to begin
robertfrost,With good luck with your stovepipe. Never mind.
robertfrost,"It’s not so bad in the country, settled down,"
robertfrost,When people’re getting on in life. You’ll like it.’
robertfrost,Joe said: ‘You big boys ought to find a farm.
robertfrost,"And make good farmers, and leave other fellows"
robertfrost,The city work to do. There’s not enough
robertfrost,For everybody as it is in there.’
robertfrost,"‘God!’ one said wildly, and, when no one spoke:"
robertfrost,‘Say that to Jimmy here. He needs a farm.’
robertfrost,But Jimmy only made his jaw recede
robertfrost,"Fool-like, and rolled his eyes as if to say"
robertfrost,He saw himself a farmer. Then there was a French boy
robertfrost,"Who said with seriousness that made them laugh,"
robertfrost,"‘Ma friend, you ain’t know what it is you’re ask.’"
robertfrost,He doffed his cap and held it with both hands
robertfrost,Across his chest to make as ’twere a bow:
robertfrost,[ 142 ]
robertfrost,‘Were giving you our chances on de farm.’
robertfrost,And then they all turned to with deafening boots
robertfrost,And put each other bodily out of the house.
robertfrost,‘Good-by to them! We puzzle them. They think—
robertfrost,I don’t know what they think we see in what
robertfrost,They leave us to: that pasture slope that seems
robertfrost,The back some farm presents us; and your woods
robertfrost,"To northward from your window at the sink,"
robertfrost,Waiting to steal a step on us whenever
robertfrost,We drop our eyes or turn to other things.
robertfrost,As in the game “Ten-step” the children play.’
robertfrost,"‘Good boys they seemed, and let them love the city."
robertfrost,All they could say was “God!” when you proposed
robertfrost,Their coming out and making useful farmers.’
robertfrost,‘Did they make something lonesome go through you?
robertfrost,It would take more than them to sicken you—
robertfrost,Us of our bargain. But they left us so
robertfrost,"As to our fate, like fools past reasoning with."
robertfrost,They almost shook me’
robertfrost,It’s all so much
robertfrost,"What we have always wanted, I confess"
robertfrost,It’s seeming bad for a moment makes it seem
robertfrost,"Even worse still, and so on down, down, down."
robertfrost,It’s nothing; it’s their leaving us at dusk.
robertfrost,I never bore it well when people went.
robertfrost,"The first night after guests have gone, the house"
robertfrost,Seems haunted or exposed. I always take
robertfrost,A personal interest in the locking up
robertfrost,At bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off.’
robertfrost,He fetched a dingy lantern from behind
robertfrost,A door. ‘There’s that we didn’t lose! And these!’—
robertfrost,[ 143 ]
robertfrost,Some matches he unpocketed. ‘For food—
robertfrost,The meals we’ve had no one can take from us.

robertfrost,We did that day was mingle great and small

robertfrost,The figure of our being less than two

robertfrost,And all the time we talked you seemed to see

robertfrost,When I see birches bend to left and right
robertfrost,"Across v he lines of straighter darker trees,"
robertfrost,I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.
robertfrost,But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay
robertfrost,As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them
robertfrost,Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
robertfrost,After a rain. They click upon themselves
robertfrost,"As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored"
robertfrost,As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
robertfrost,Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells
robertfrost,Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—
robertfrost,Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
robertfrost,You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
robertfrost,"They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,"
robertfrost,And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed
robertfrost,"So low for long, they never right themselves :"
robertfrost,You may see their trunks arching in the woods
robertfrost,"Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground"
robertfrost,Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
robertfrost,Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
robertfrost,But I was going to say when Truth broke in
robertfrost,With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm
robertfrost,I should prefer to have some boy bend them
robertfrost,As he went out and in to fetch the cows—
robertfrost,"Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,"
robertfrost,Whose only play was what he found himself.
robertfrost,"Summer or winter, and could play alone."
robertfrost,One by one he subdued his father’s trees
robertfrost,By riding them down over and over again
robertfrost,Until he took the stiffness out of them.
robertfrost,"And not one but hung limp, not one was left"
robertfrost,[1521

robertfrost,To learn about not launching out too soon
robertfrost,And so not carrying the tree away

robertfrost,And life is too much like a pathless v^oqd
robertfrost,Where your face bums and tickles wit^^e cobwebs
robertfrost,"Broken across it, and one eye is weeping"
robertfrost,From a twig’s having lashed across it open
robertfrost,I’d like to get away from earth awhile
robertfrost,And then come back to it and begin over.
robertfrost,May no fate willfully misunderstand me
robertfrost,And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
robertfrost,Not to return. Earth’s the right place for love:
robertfrost,I don’t know where it’s likely to go better.
robertfrost,"I’d like to go by climbing a birch tree,"
robertfrost,And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
robertfrost,"Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more."

robertfrost,"Looked up toward heaven, and there against the blue."
robertfrost,"Stood over me a resurrected tree,"

robertfrost,Under the sunset far into Vermont.
robertfrost,"And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,"
robertfrost,"As it ran light, or had to bear a load."
robertfrost,And nothing happened: day was all but done.
robertfrost,"Call it a day, I wish they might have said"
robertfrost,To please the boy by giving him the half hour
robertfrost,That a boy counts so much when saved from work.
robertfrost,His sister stood beside them in her apron
robertfrost,"To tell them ‘Supper.’ At the word, the saw."
robertfrost,As if to prove saws knew what supper meant.
robertfrost,"Leaped out at the boy’s hand, or seemed to leap—"
robertfrost,He must have given the hand. However it was.
robertfrost,Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!
robertfrost,The boy’s first outcry was a rueful laugh.
robertfrost,As he swung toward them holding up the hand
robertfrost,"Half in appeal, but half as if to keep"
robertfrost,The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all—
robertfrost,"Since he was old enough to know, big boy"
robertfrost,"Doing a man’s work, though a child at heart—"
robertfrost,He saw all spoiled. ‘Don’t let him cut my hand off—
robertfrost,"The doctor, when he comes. Don’t let him, sister!’"
robertfrost,So. But the hand was gone already.
robertfrost,The doctor put him in the dark of ether.
robertfrost,He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.
robertfrost,And then— the watcher at his pulse took fright.
robertfrost,No one believed. They listened at his heart.
robertfrost,[ 171 ]
robertfrost,Little— less— nothing!— and that ended it.
robertfrost,"No more to build on there. And they, since they"
robertfrost,"Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs."

robertfrost,BROWN’S DESCENT
robertfrost,or
robertfrost,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE
robertfrost,Brown lived at such a lofty farm
robertfrost,That everyone for miles could see
robertfrost,His lantern when he did his chores
robertfrost,In winter after half-past three.
robertfrost,And many must have seen him make
robertfrost,"His wild descent from there one night,"
robertfrost,"’Cross lots, ’cross walls, ’cross everything."
robertfrost,Describing rings of lantern light.
robertfrost,Between the house and barn the gale
robertfrost,Got him by something he had on
robertfrost,And blew him out on the icy crust
robertfrost,"That cased the world, and he was gone!"
robertfrost,"Walls were all buried, trees were few:"
robertfrost,He saw no stay unless he stove
robertfrost,A hole in somewhere with his heel.
robertfrost,But though repeatedly he strove
robertfrost,"And stamped and said things to himself,"
robertfrost,And sometimes something seemed to yield.
robertfrost,"He gained no foothold, but pursued"
robertfrost,His journey down from field to field.
robertfrost,Sometimes he came with arms outspread
robertfrost,"Like wings, revolving in the scene"
robertfrost,"Upon his longer axis, and"
robertfrost,With no small dignity of mien.
robertfrost,[ 173 ]
robertfrost,"Faster or slower as he chanced,"
robertfrost,Sitting or standing as he chose.
robertfrost,According as he feared to risk
robertfrost,"His neck, or thought to spare his clothes."
robertfrost,He never let the lantern drop.
robertfrost,And some exclaimed who saw afar
robertfrost,"The figures he described with it,"
robertfrost,‘I wonder what those signals are
robertfrost,‘Brown makes at such an hour of night I
robertfrost,He’s celebrating something strange.
robertfrost,I wonder if he’s sold his farm.
robertfrost,Or been made Master of the Grange/
robertfrost,"He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked;"
robertfrost,He fell and made the lantern rattle
robertfrost,(But saved the light from going out.)
robertfrost,So halfway down he fought the battle.
robertfrost,Incredulous of his own bad luck.
robertfrost,And then becoming reconciled
robertfrost,"To everything, he gave it up"
robertfrost,And came down like a coasting child.
robertfrost,"‘Well— I— be— ’ that was all he said,"
robertfrost,"As standing in the river road,"
robertfrost,He looked back up the slippery slope
robertfrost,(Two miles it was) to his abode.
robertfrost,Sometimes as an authority
robertfrost,"On motor-cars, I’m asked if I"
robertfrost,Should say our stock was petered out.
robertfrost,And this is my sincere reply:
robertfrost,[ 174 ]
robertfrost,Yankees are what they always were.
robertfrost,Don’t think Brown ever gave up hope
robertfrost,Of getting home again because
robertfrost,He couldn’t climb that slippery slope;
robertfrost,Or even thought of standing there
robertfrost,Until the January thaw
robertfrost,Should take the polish off the crust.
robertfrost,"He bowed with grace to natural law,"
robertfrost,"And then went round it on his feet,"
robertfrost,After the manner of our stock;
robertfrost,Not much concerned for those to whom.
robertfrost,At that particular time o’clock.
robertfrost,It must have looked as if the course
robertfrost,He steered was really straight away
robertfrost,From that which he was headed for—
robertfrost,"Not much concerned for them, I say;"
robertfrost,No more so than became a man—
robertfrost,And politician at odd seasons.
robertfrost,I’ve kept Brown standing in the cold
robertfrost,While I invested him with reasons;
robertfrost,But now he snapped his eyes three times;
robertfrost,"Then shook his lantern, saying, Tie’s"
robertfrost,’Bout out!’ and took the long way home
robertfrost,"By road, a matter of several miles."
robertfrost,[ 175 ]
robertfrost,THE GUM-GATHERER
robertfrost,There overtook me and drew me in
robertfrost,"To his down-hill, early-morning stride,"
robertfrost,And set me five miles on my road
robertfrost,"Better than if he had had me ride,"
robertfrost,A man with a swinging bag for load
robertfrost,And half the bag wound round his hand.
robertfrost,We talked like barking above the din
robertfrost,Of water we walked along beside.
robertfrost,And for my telling him where I’d been
robertfrost,And where I lived in mountain land
robertfrost,"To be coming home the way I was,"
robertfrost,He told me a little about himself.
robertfrost,He came from higher up in the pass
robertfrost,Where the grist of the new-beginning brooks
robertfrost,Is blocks split off the mountain mass—
robertfrost,And hopeless grist enough it looks
robertfrost,Ever to grind to soil for grass.
robertfrost,(The way it is will do for moss.)
robertfrost,There he had built his stolen shack.
robertfrost,It had to be a stolen shack
robertfrost,Because of the fears of fire and loss
robertfrost,That trouble the sleep of lumber folk:
robertfrost,Visions of half the world burned black
robertfrost,And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke.
robertfrost,We know who when they come to town
robertfrost,Bring berries under the wagon seat.
robertfrost,Or a basket of eggs between their feet;
robertfrost,What this man brought in a cotton sack
robertfrost,"Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce."
robertfrost,He showed me lumps of the scented stuff
robertfrost,"Like uncut jewels, dull and rough."
robertfrost,[ 176 ]
robertfrost,It comes to market golden brown;
robertfrost,But turns to pink between the teeth.
robertfrost,I told him this is a pleasant life
robertfrost,To set your breast to the bark of trees
robertfrost,"That all your days are dim beneath,"
robertfrost,And reaching up with a little knife.
robertfrost,To loose the resin and take it down
robertfrost,And bring it to market when you please.
robertfrost,[ 177 ]
robertfrost,THE LINE-GANG
robertfrost,Here come the line-gang pioneering by.
robertfrost,They throw a forest down less cut than broken.
robertfrost,"They plant dead trees for living, and the dead"
robertfrost,They string together with a living thread.
robertfrost,They string an instrument against the sky
robertfrost,Wherein words whether beaten out or spoken
robertfrost,Will run as hushed as when they were a thought
robertfrost,But in no hush they string it: they go past
robertfrost,"With shouts afar to pull the cable taut,"
robertfrost,"To hold it hard until they make it fast,"
robertfrost,"To ease away— they have it. With a laugh,"
robertfrost,An oath of towns that set the wild at naught
robertfrost,They bring the telephone and telegraph.
robertfrost,[ 178 ]
robertfrost,THE VANISHING RED
robertfrost,He is said to have been the last Red Man
robertfrost,In Acton. And the Miller is said to have laughed—
robertfrost,If you like to call such a sound a laugh.
robertfrost,But he gave no one else a laugher’s license.
robertfrost,"For he turned suddenly grave as if to say,"
robertfrost,"‘Whose business,— if I take it on myself,"
robertfrost,Whose business— but why talk round the barn?—
robertfrost,When it’s just that I hold with getting a thing done with.
robertfrost,You can’t get back and see it as he saw it.
robertfrost,It’s too long a story to go into now.
robertfrost,You’d have to have been there and lived it.
robertfrost,Then you wouldn’t have looked on it as just a matter
robertfrost,Of who began it between the two races.
robertfrost,Some guttural exclamation of surprise
robertfrost,The Red Man gave in poking about the mill
robertfrost,Over the great big thumping shuffling millstone
robertfrost,Disgusted the Miller physically as coming
robertfrost,From one who had no right to be heard from.
robertfrost,"‘Come, John,’ he said, ‘you want to see the wheel-pit?’"
robertfrost,He took him down below a cramping rafter.
robertfrost,"And showed him, through a manhole in the floor."
robertfrost,"The water in desperate straits like frantic fish,"
robertfrost,"Salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails."
robertfrost,Then he shut down the trap door with a ring in it
robertfrost,"That jangled even above the general noise,"
robertfrost,"And came upstairs alone— and gave that laugh,"
robertfrost,And said something to a man with a meal-sack
robertfrost,That the man with the meal-sack didn’t catch— then.
robertfrost,"Oh, yes, he showed John the wheel-pit all right."
robertfrost,[ 179 ]
robertfrost,SNOW
robertfrost,The three stood listening to a fresh access
robertfrost,Of wind that caught against the house a moment.
robertfrost,"Gulped snow, and then blew free again— the Coles"
robertfrost,"Dressed, but disheveled from some hours of sleep,"
robertfrost,Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore.
robertfrost,Meserve was first to speak. He pointed backward
robertfrost,"Over his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying,"
robertfrost,‘You can just see it glancing off the roof
robertfrost,Making a great scroll upward toward the sky.
robertfrost,Long enough for recording all our names on.—
robertfrost,I think I’ll just call up my wife and tell her
robertfrost,I’m here— so far— and starting on again.
robertfrost,I’ll call her softly so that if she’s wise
robertfrost,"And gone to sleep, she needn’t wake to answer/"
robertfrost,"Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened."
robertfrost,"Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I’m at Cole’s. I’m late."
robertfrost,I called you up to say Good-night from here
robertfrost,Before I went to say Good-morning there.—
robertfrost,"I thought I would.— I know, but, Lett— I know—"
robertfrost,"I could, but what’s the sense? The rest won’t be"
robertfrost,"So bad.— Give me an hour for it.— Ho, ho."
robertfrost,Three hours to here! But that was all up hill;
robertfrost,"The rest is down.— Why no, no, not a wallow:"
robertfrost,They kept their heads and took their time to it
robertfrost,"Like darlings, both of them. They’re in the bam.—"
robertfrost,My dear. I’m coming just the same. I didn’t
robertfrost,Call you to ask you to invite me home.—’
robertfrost,He lingered for some word she wouldn’t say.
robertfrost,"Said it at last himself, ‘Good-night,’ and then"
robertfrost,"Getting no answer, closed the telephone."
robertfrost,[ 180 ]
robertfrost,The three stood in the lamplight round the table
robertfrost,"With lowered eyes a moment till he said,"
robertfrost,‘I’ll just see how the horses are.’
robertfrost,"‘Yes, do,’"
robertfrost,Both the Coles said together. Mrs. Cole
robertfrost,Added: ‘You can judge better after seeing —
robertfrost,"I want you here with me, Fred. Leave him here,"
robertfrost,Brother Meserve. You know to find your way
robertfrost,Out through the shed.’
robertfrost,"‘I guess I know my way,"
robertfrost,I guess I know where I can find my name
robertfrost,Carved in the shed to tell me who I am
robertfrost,If it don’t tell me where I am. I used
robertfrost,To play—’
robertfrost,‘You tend your horses and come back.
robertfrost,"Fred Cole, you’re going to let him!’"
robertfrost,"‘Well, aren’t you"
robertfrost,How can you help yourself?’
robertfrost,‘I called him Brother.
robertfrost,Why did I call him that?’
robertfrost,‘It’s right enough.
robertfrost,That’s all you ever heard him called round here.
robertfrost,He seems to have lost off his Christian name.’
robertfrost,‘Christian enough I should call that myself.
robertfrost,"He took no notice, did he? Well, at least"
robertfrost,"I didn’t use it out of love of him,"
robertfrost,The dear knows. I detest the thought of him
robertfrost,With his ten children under ten years old.
robertfrost,[ 181 ]
robertfrost,"I hate his wretched little Racker Sect,"
robertfrost,"All’s ever I heard of it, which isn’t much."
robertfrost,"But that’s not saying— Look, Fred Cole, it's twelve."
robertfrost,"Isn’t it, now? He’s been here half an hour."
robertfrost,He says he left the village store at nine.
robertfrost,Three hours to do four miles— a mile an hour
robertfrost,"Or not much better. Why, it doesn’t seem"
robertfrost,As if a man could move that slow and move.
robertfrost,Try to think what he did with all that time.
robertfrost,And three miles more to go!’
robertfrost,‘Don’t let him go.
robertfrost,"Stick to him, Helen. Make him answer you."
robertfrost,That sort of man talks straight on all his life
robertfrost,"From the last thing he said himself, stone deaf"
robertfrost,To anything anyone else may say.
robertfrost,"I should have thought, though, you could make him hear you.’"
robertfrost,“What is he doing out a night like this?
robertfrost,Why can’t he stay at home?’
robertfrost,‘He had to preach.’
robertfrost,‘It’s no night to be out.’
robertfrost,‘He may be small.
robertfrost,"He may be good, but one thing’s sure, he’s tough.’"
robertfrost,‘And strong of stale tobacco.’
robertfrost,‘Hell pull through.’
robertfrost,‘You only say so. Not another house
robertfrost,Or shelter to put into from this place
robertfrost,[ 182 ]
robertfrost,To theirs. I’m going to call his wife again.’
robertfrost,“Wait and he may. Let’s see wiiat he will dc
robertfrost,Let’s see if he will think of her again.
robertfrost,But then I doubt he’s thinking of himself.
robertfrost,He doesn’t look on it as anything.’
robertfrost,‘He shan’t go— there!’
robertfrost,"‘It is a night, my dear."
robertfrost,‘One thing: he didn’t drag God into it.’
robertfrost,‘He don’t consider it a case for God.’
robertfrost,"‘You think so, do you? You don’t know the kind."
robertfrost,He’s getting up a miracle this minute.
robertfrost,"Privately— to himself, right now, he’s thinking"
robertfrost,"He’ll make a case of it if he succeeds,"
robertfrost,But keep still if he fails.’
robertfrost,‘Keep still all over.
robertfrost,He’ll be dead— dead and buried.’
robertfrost,‘Such a trouble!
robertfrost,Not but I’ve every reason not to care
robertfrost,What happens to him if it only takes
robertfrost,Some of the sanctimonious conceit
robertfrost,Out of one of those pious scalawags.’
robertfrost,‘Nonsense to that! You want to see him safe.’
robertfrost,“You like the runt.’
robertfrost,[ 183 ]
robertfrost,‘Don’t you a little?’
robertfrost,"‘Well,"
robertfrost,"I don’t like what he’s doing, which is what"
robertfrost,"You like, and like him for.’"
robertfrost,"‘Oh, yes you do."
robertfrost,You like your fun as well as anyone;
robertfrost,Only you women have to put these airs on
robertfrost,To impress men. You’ve got us so ashamed
robertfrost,Of being men we can’t look at a good fight
robertfrost,Between two boys and not feel bound to stop it.
robertfrost,"Let the man freeze an ear or two, I say.—"
robertfrost,He’s here. I leave him all to you. Go in
robertfrost,"And save his life.— All right, come in, Meserve."
robertfrost,"Sit down, sit down. How did you find the horses?’"
robertfrost,"‘Fine, fine.’"
robertfrost,‘And ready for some more? My wife here
robertfrost,Says it won’t do. You’ve got to give it up.'
robertfrost,‘Won’t you to please me? Please! If I say please?
robertfrost,"Mr. Meserve, I’ll leave it to your wife."
robertfrost,What did your wife say on the telephone?’
robertfrost,Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp
robertfrost,Or something not far from it on the table.
robertfrost,"By straightening out and lifting a forefinger,"
robertfrost,He pointed with his hand from where it lay
robertfrost,Like a white crumpled spider on his knee:
robertfrost,‘That leaf there in your open book! It moved
robertfrost,"Just then, I thought. It’s stood erect like that,"
robertfrost,[ 184 ]
robertfrost,"There on the table, ever since I came,"
robertfrost,"Trying to turn itself backward or forward,"
robertfrost,I’ve had my eye on it to make out which;
robertfrost,"If forward, then it’s with a friend’s impatience—"
robertfrost,You see I know— to get you on to things
robertfrost,"It wants to see how you will take, if backward"
robertfrost,It’s from regret for something you have passed
robertfrost,"And failed to see the good of. Never mind,"
robertfrost,Things must expect to come in front of us
robertfrost,A many times— I don’t say just how many—
robertfrost,That varies with the things— before we see them.
robertfrost,One of the lies would make it out that nothing
robertfrost,Ever presents itself before us twice.
robertfrost,Where would we be at last if that were so?
robertfrost,Our very life depends on everything’s
robertfrost,Recurring till we answer from within.
robertfrost,The thousandth time may prove the charm.— That leaf!
robertfrost,It can’t turn either way. It needs the wind’s help.
robertfrost,But the wind didn’t move it if it moved.
robertfrost,It moved itself. The wind’s at naught in here.
robertfrost,It couldn’t stir so sensitively poised
robertfrost,A thing as that. It couldn’t reach the lamp
robertfrost,To get a puff of black smoke from the flame.
robertfrost,Or blow a rumple in the collie’s coat.
robertfrost,"You make a little foursquare block of air,"
robertfrost,"Quiet and light and warm, in spite of all"
robertfrost,The illim itable dark and cold and storm.
robertfrost,"And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,"
robertfrost,"And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;"
robertfrost,"Though for all anyone can tell, repose"
robertfrost,"May be the thing you haven’t, yet you give it."
robertfrost,So false it is that what we haven’t we can’t give;
robertfrost,"So false, that what we always say is true."
robertfrost,[ 185 ]
robertfrost,I’ll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.
robertfrost,It won’t lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?’
robertfrost,"T shouldn’t want to hurry you, Meserve,"
robertfrost,"But if you’re going— say you’ll stay, you know."
robertfrost,But let me raise this curtain on a scene.
robertfrost,And show you how it’s piling up against you.
robertfrost,You see the snow-white through the white of frost?
robertfrost,Ask Helen how far up the sash it’s climbed
robertfrost,Since last we read the gauge.’
robertfrost,‘It looks as if
robertfrost,Some pallid thing had squashed its features flat
robertfrost,And its eyes shut with overeagerness
robertfrost,To see what people found so interesting
robertfrost,"In one another, and had gone to sleep"
robertfrost,"Of its own stupid lack of understanding,"
robertfrost,Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff
robertfrost,"Short off, and died against the window-pane.’"
robertfrost,"‘Brother Meserve, take care, you’ll scare yourself"
robertfrost,More than you will us with such nightmare talk.
robertfrost,"It’s you it matters to, because it’s you"
robertfrost,Who have to go out into it alone.’
robertfrost,"‘Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he’ll stay.’"
robertfrost,‘Before you drop the curtain— I’m reminded:
robertfrost,You recollect the boy who came out here
robertfrost,To breathe the air one winter— had a room
robertfrost,"Down at the Averys’? Well, one sunny morning"
robertfrost,"After a downy storm, he passed our place"
robertfrost,And found me banking up the house with snow.
robertfrost,"And I was burrowing in deep for warmth,"
robertfrost,[ 186 ]
robertfrost,p ilin g it well above the window-sills.
robertfrost,The snow against the window caught his eye.
robertfrost,"“Hey, that’s a pretty thought”— those were his words."
robertfrost,“So you can think it’s six feet deep outside.
robertfrost,While you sit warm and read up balanced rations.
robertfrost,You can’t get too much winter in the winter.”
robertfrost,Those were his words. And he went home and all
robertfrost,But banked the daylight out of Avery’s windows.
robertfrost,Now you and I would go to no such length.
robertfrost,At the same time you can’t deny it makes
robertfrost,"It not a mite worse, sitting here, we three."
robertfrost,"Playing our fancy, to have the snowline run"
robertfrost,So high across the pane outside. There where
robertfrost,There is a sort of tunnel in the frost
robertfrost,More like a tunnel than a hole— way down
robertfrost,At the far end of it you see a stir
robertfrost,And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift
robertfrost,Blown in the wind. I like that— I like that.
robertfrost,"Well, now I leave you, people.’"
robertfrost,"‘Come, Meserve,"
robertfrost,We thought you were deciding not to go—
robertfrost,The ways you found to say the praise of comfort
robertfrost,And being where you are. You want to stay.’
robertfrost,Til own it’s cold for such a fall of snow.
robertfrost,"This house is frozen brittle, all except"
robertfrost,This room you sit in. If you think the wind
robertfrost,"Sounds further off, it’s not because it’s dying;"
robertfrost,You’re further under in the snow— that’s all—
robertfrost,And feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust
robertfrost,"It bursts against us at the chimney mouth,"
robertfrost,And at the eaves. I like it from inside
robertfrost,More than I shall out in it. But the horses
robertfrost,ri87]
robertfrost,"Are rested and it’s time to say good-night,"
robertfrost,"And let you get to bed again. Cood-night,"
robertfrost,Sorry I had to break in on your sleep.’
robertfrost,‘Lucky for you you did. Lucky for you
robertfrost,You had us for a halfway station
robertfrost,To stop at. If you were the kind of man
robertfrost,"Paid heed to women, you’d take my advice"
robertfrost,And for your family’s sake stay where you are.
robertfrost,But what good is my saying it over and over?
robertfrost,You’ve done more than you had a right to think
robertfrost,You could do— now. You know the risk you take
robertfrost,In going on.’
robertfrost,‘Our snow-storms as a rule
robertfrost,"Aren’t looked on as man-killers, and although"
robertfrost,I’d rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep
robertfrost,"Under it all, his door sealed up and lost."
robertfrost,Than the man fighting it to keep above it.
robertfrost,Yet think of the small birds at roost and not
robertfrost,In nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?
robertfrost,Their bulk in water would be frozen rock
robertfrost,In no time out tonight. And yet tomorrow
robertfrost,They will come budding boughs from tree to tree
robertfrost,"Flirting their wings and saying' Chickadee,"
robertfrost,As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm.’
robertfrost,‘But why when no one wants you to go on?
robertfrost,"Your wife— she doesn’t want you to. We don’t,"
robertfrost,And you yourself don’t want to. Who else is there?’
robertfrost,‘Save us from being cornered by a woman.
robertfrost,"Well, there’s—’ She told Fred afterward that in"
robertfrost,"The pause right there, she thought the dreaded word"
robertfrost,[ 188 ]
robertfrost,"Was coming, ‘God.’ But no, he only said,"
robertfrost,"“Well, there’s— the storm. That says I must go on."
robertfrost,That wants me as a war might if it came.
robertfrost,Ask any man.’
robertfrost,He threw her that as something
robertfrost,To last her till he got outside the door.
robertfrost,He had Cole with him to the bam to see him off.
robertfrost,When Cole returned he found his wife still standing
robertfrost,Beside the table near the open book.
robertfrost,Not reading it.
robertfrost,"‘Well, what kind of a man"
robertfrost,Do you call that?’ she said.
robertfrost,‘He had the gift
robertfrost,"Of words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?’"
robertfrost,‘Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?’
robertfrost,‘Or disregarding people’s civil questions—
robertfrost,What? We’ve found out in one hour more about him
robertfrost,Than we had seeing him pass by in the road
robertfrost,A thousand times. If that’s the way he preaches!
robertfrost,You didn’t think you’d keep him after all.
robertfrost,"Oh, I’m not blaming you. He didn’t leave you"
robertfrost,"Much say in the matter, and I’m just as glad"
robertfrost,Were not in for a night of him. No sleep
robertfrost,If he had stayed. The least thing set him going.
robertfrost,It’s quiet as an empty church without him.’
robertfrost,‘But how much better off are we as it is?
robertfrost,We’ll have to sit here till we know he’s safe.’
robertfrost,"“Yes, I suppose you’ll want to, but I shouldn’t."
robertfrost,[ 189 ]
robertfrost,"He knows what he can do, or he wouldn’t try."
robertfrost,"Get into bed I say, and get some rest."
robertfrost,"He won’t come back, and if he telephones,"
robertfrost,It won’t be for an hour or two.’
robertfrost,Well then.
robertfrost,We can’t be any help by sitting here
robertfrost,"And living his fight through with him, I suppose. 5"
robertfrost,Cole had been telephoning in the dark.
robertfrost,Mrs. Cole’s voice came from an inner room:
robertfrost,’Did she call you or you call her?’
robertfrost,‘She me.
robertfrost,You’d better dress: you won’t go back to bed.
robertfrost,We must have been asleep: it’s three and after.’
robertfrost,‘Had she been ringing long? I’ll get my wrapper.
robertfrost,I want to speak to her.’
robertfrost,‘All she said was.
robertfrost,He hadn’t come and had he really started.’
robertfrost,"‘She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago.’"
robertfrost,‘He had the shovel. He’ll have made a fight.’
robertfrost,Why did I ever let him leave this house!’
robertfrost,‘Don’t begin that. You did the best you could
robertfrost,To keep him— though perhaps you didn’t quite
robertfrost,Conceal a wish to see him show the spunk
robertfrost,To disobey you. Much his wife’ll thank you.’
robertfrost,[ 190 ]
robertfrost,"‘Fred, after all I said! You shan’t make out"
robertfrost,That it was any way but what it was.
robertfrost,Did she let on by any word she said
robertfrost,She didn’t thank me?’
robertfrost,"‘When I told her “Gone,”"
robertfrost,"“Well then,” she said, and ‘Well then”— like a threat."
robertfrost,"And then her voice came scraping slow: “Oh, you."
robertfrost,Why did you let him go?” ’
robertfrost,‘Asked why we let him?
robertfrost,You let me there. I’ll ask her why she let him.
robertfrost,She didn’t dare to speak when he was here.
robertfrost,Their number’s— twenty-one? The thing won’t work.
robertfrost,Someone’s receiver’s down. The handle stumbles.
robertfrost,"The stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm!"
robertfrost,It’s theirs. She’s dropped it from her hand and gone.
robertfrost,Try speaking. Say “Hello!”’
robertfrost,‘Hello. Hello.’
robertfrost,What do you hear?’
robertfrost,‘I hear an empty room—
robertfrost,"You know— it sounds that way. And yes, I hear—"
robertfrost,I think I hear a clock— and windows rattling.
robertfrost,No step though. If she’s there she’s sitting down.’
robertfrost,"‘Shout, she may hear you.’"
robertfrost,‘Shouting is no good.’
robertfrost,“Keep speaking then.’
robertfrost,[ 191 ]
robertfrost,‘Hello. Hello. Hello.
robertfrost,You don’t suppose—? She wouldn’t go outdoors?’
robertfrost,‘I’m half afraid that’s just what she might do.’
robertfrost,‘And leave the children?’
robertfrost,‘Wait and call again.
robertfrost,You can’t hear whether she has left the door
robertfrost,Wide open and the wind’s blown out the lamp
robertfrost,And the fire’s died and the room’s dark and cold?’
robertfrost,"‘One of two things, either she’s gone to bed"
robertfrost,Or gone outdoors.’
robertfrost,‘In which case both are lost.
robertfrost,Do you know what she’s like? Have you ever met her?
robertfrost,It’s strange she doesn’t want to speak to us.’
robertfrost,"‘Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come.’"
robertfrost,‘A clock maybe.’
robertfrost,‘Don’t you hear something else?’
robertfrost,‘Not talking.’
robertfrost,‘No.’
robertfrost,"Why, yes, I hear— what is it?’"
robertfrost,What do you say it is?’
robertfrost,‘A baby’s crying!
robertfrost,"Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off."
robertfrost,[ 192 ]
robertfrost,Its mother wouldn’t let it cry like that.
robertfrost,Not if she’s there.’
robertfrost,‘What do you make of it?'
robertfrost,"'There’s only one thing possible to make,"
robertfrost,"That is, assuming— that she has gone out."
robertfrost,Of course she hasn’t though.’ They both sat down
robertfrost,Helpless. ‘There’s nothing we can do till morning.’
robertfrost,"‘Fred, I shan’t let you think of going out.’"
robertfrost,‘Hold on.’ The double bell began to chirp.
robertfrost,They started up. Fred took the telephone.
robertfrost,"‘Hello, Meserve. You’re there, then!— And your wife?"
robertfrost,Good! Why I asked— she didn’t seem to answer.
robertfrost,He says she went to let him in the bam.—
robertfrost,"We’re glad. Oh, say no more about it, man."
robertfrost,Drop in and see us when you’re passing.’
robertfrost,"‘Well,"
robertfrost,"She has him then, though what she wants him for"
robertfrost,I don’t see.’
robertfrost,‘Possibly not for herself.
robertfrost,Maybe she only wants him for the children.’
robertfrost,‘The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing.
robertfrost,What spoiled our night was to him just his fun.
robertfrost,What did he come in for?— To talk and visit?
robertfrost,Thought he’d just call to tell us it was snowing.
robertfrost,If he thinks he is going to make our house
robertfrost,A halfway coffee house ’twixt town and nowhere—’
robertfrost,[ 193 ]
robertfrost,T thought you’d feel you’d been too much concerned/
robertfrost,‘You think you haven’t been concerned yourself.’
robertfrost,If you mean he was inconsiderate
robertfrost,To rout us out to think for him at midnight
robertfrost,"And then take our advice no more than nothing,"
robertfrost,"Why, I agree with you. But let’s forgive him."
robertfrost,We’ve had a share in one night of his life.
robertfrost,What’ll you bet he ever calls again?’
robertfrost,[ 194 ]
robertfrost,THE SOUND OF TREES
robertfrost,I wonder about the trees.
robertfrost,Why do we wish to bear
robertfrost,Forever the noise of these
robertfrost,More than another noise
robertfrost,So close to our dwelling place?
robertfrost,We suffer them by the day
robertfrost,"Till we lose all measure of pace,"
robertfrost,"And fixity in our joys,"
robertfrost,And acquire a listening air.
robertfrost,They are that that talks of going
robertfrost,But never gets away;
robertfrost,And that talks no less for knowing.
robertfrost,"As it grows wiser and older,"
robertfrost,That now it means to stay.
robertfrost,My feet tug at the floor
robertfrost,And my head sways to my shoulder
robertfrost,"Sometimes when I watch trees sway,"
robertfrost,From the window or the door.
robertfrost,"I shall set forth for somewhere,"
robertfrost,I shall make the reckless choice
robertfrost,Some day when they are in voice
robertfrost,And tossing so as to scare
robertfrost,The white clouds over them on.
robertfrost,I shall have less to say.
robertfrost,But I shall be gone.

robertfrost,NEW
robertfrost,HAMPSHIRE
robertfrost,NEW HAMPSHIRE
robertfrost,I met a lady from the South who said
robertfrost,"(You won’t believe she said it, but she said it):"
robertfrost,"‘None of my family ever worked, or had"
robertfrost,A thing to sell.’ I don’t suppose the work
robertfrost,Much matters. You may work for all of me.
robertfrost,I’ve seen the time I’ve had to work myself.
robertfrost,The having anything to sell is what
robertfrost,Is the disgrace in man or state or nation.
robertfrost,I met a traveler from Arkansas
robertfrost,Who boasted of his state as beautiful
robertfrost,For diamonds and apples. ‘Diamonds
robertfrost,And apples in commercial quantities?
robertfrost,"I asked him, on my guard. ‘Oh, yes,’ he answered."
robertfrost,Off his. The time was evening in the Pullman.
robertfrost,"‘I see the porter’s made your bed,’ I told him."
robertfrost,I met a Californian who would
robertfrost,Talk California— a state so blessed.
robertfrost,"He said, in climate, none had ever died there"
robertfrost,"A natural death, and Vigilance Committees"
robertfrost,Had had to organize to stock the graveyards
robertfrost,And vindicate the state’s humanity.
robertfrost,"‘Just the way Stefansson runs on,’ I murmured,"
robertfrost,‘About the British Arctic. That’s what comes
robertfrost,Of being in the market with a climate.
robertfrost,"I met a poet from another state,"
robertfrost,"A zealot full of fluid inspiration,"
robertfrost,"Who in the name of fluid inspiration,"
robertfrost,"But in the best style of bad salesmanship,"
robertfrost,[ 199 ]
robertfrost,Angrily tried to make me write a protest
robertfrost,(In verse I think) against the Volstead Act.
robertfrost,He didn’t even offer me a drink
robertfrost,Until I asked for one to steady him.
robertfrost,This is called having an idea to sell.
robertfrost,It never could have happened in New Hampshire.
robertfrost,The only person really soiled with trade
robertfrost,I ever stumbled on in old New Hampshire
robertfrost,Was someone who had just come back ashamed
robertfrost,From selling things in California.
robertfrost,He’d built a noble mansard roof with balls
robertfrost,"On turrets like Constantinople, deep"
robertfrost,In woods some ten miles from a railroad station.
robertfrost,As if to put forever out of mind
robertfrost,"The hope of being, as we say, received."
robertfrost,I found him standing at the close of day
robertfrost,"Inside the threshold of his open bam,"
robertfrost,Like a lone actor on a gloomy stage—
robertfrost,And recognized him through the iron gray
robertfrost,In which his face was muffled to the eyes
robertfrost,"As an old boyhood friend, and once indeed"
robertfrost,A drover with me on the road to Brighton.
robertfrost,"His farm was ‘grounds,’ and not a farm at all;"
robertfrost,His house among the local sheds and shanties
robertfrost,Rose like a factor’s at a trading station.
robertfrost,"And he was rich, and I was still a rascal."
robertfrost,I couldn’t keep from asking impolitely.
robertfrost,Where had he been and what had he been doing?
robertfrost,How did he get so? (Rich was understood.)
robertfrost,In dealing in ‘old rags’ in San Francisco.
robertfrost,"Oh, it was terrible as well could be."
robertfrost,We both of us turned over in our graves.
robertfrost,[2001
robertfrost,"Just specimens is all New Hampshire has,"
robertfrost,One each of everything as in a show-case
robertfrost,Which naturally she doesn’t care to sell.
robertfrost,"She had one President (pronounce him Purse,"
robertfrost,And make the most of it for better or worse.
robertfrost,He’s your one chance to score against the state).
robertfrost,She had one Daniel Webster. He was all
robertfrost,The Daniel Webster ever was or shall be.
robertfrost,She had the Dartmouth needed to produce him.
robertfrost,I call her old. She has one family
robertfrost,Whose claim is good to being settled here
robertfrost,"Before the era of colonization,"
robertfrost,And before that of exploration even.
robertfrost,John Smith remarked them as he coasted by
robertfrost,Dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf
robertfrost,"At the Isles of Shoals, and satisfied himself"
robertfrost,"They weren’t Red Indians, but veritable"
robertfrost,"Pre-primitives of the white race, dawn people,"
robertfrost,Like those who furnished Adam’s sons with wives
robertfrost,However uninnocent they may have been
robertfrost,In being there so early in our history.
robertfrost,They’d been there then a hundred years or more.
robertfrost,Pity he didn’t ask what they were up to
robertfrost,"At that date with a wharf already built,"
robertfrost,And take their name. They’ve since told me their na
robertfrost,Today an honored one in Nottingham.
robertfrost,As for what they were up to more than fishing—
robertfrost,"Suppose they weren’t behaving Puritanly,"
robertfrost,The hour had not yet struck for being good.
robertfrost,Mankind had not yet gone on the Sabbatical.
robertfrost,It became an explorer of the deep
robertfrost,Not to explore too deep in others’ business.
robertfrost,[ 201 ]
robertfrost,"Did you but know of him, Hampshire has"
robertfrost,One real reformer who would change the world
robertfrost,"So it would be accepted by two classes,"
robertfrost,Artists the minute they set up as artists.
robertfrost,"Before, that is, they are themselves accepted."
robertfrost,And boys the minute they get out of college.
robertfrost,I can’t help thinking those are tests to go by.
robertfrost,And she has one I don’t know what to call liim.
robertfrost,Who comes from Philadelphia every year
robertfrost,With a great flock of chickens of rare breeds
robertfrost,He wants to give the educational
robertfrost,Advantages of growing almost wild
robertfrost,Under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle—
robertfrost,"Dorkings because they’re spoken of by Chaucer,"
robertfrost,Sussex because they’re spoken of by Herrick.
robertfrost,She has a touch of gold. New Hampshire gold—
robertfrost,You may have heard of it. I had a farm
robertfrost,Offered me not long since up Berlin way
robertfrost,With a mine on it that was worked for gold;
robertfrost,"But not gold in commercial quantities,"
robertfrost,Just enough gold to make the engagement rings
robertfrost,And marriage rings of those who owned the farm.
robertfrost,What gold more innocent could one have asked for?
robertfrost,One of my children ranging after rocks
robertfrost,Lately brought home from Andover or Canaan
robertfrost,A specimen of beryl with a trace
robertfrost,Of radium. I know with radium
robertfrost,The trace would have to be the merest trace
robertfrost,To be below the threshold of commercial;
robertfrost,But trust New Hampshire not to have enough
robertfrost,Of radium or anything to sell.
robertfrost,[ 202 ]
robertfrost,"A specimen of everything, I said."
robertfrost,She has one witch— old style. She lives in Colebrook.
robertfrost,(The only other witch I ever met
robertfrost,Was lately at a cut-glass dinner in Boston.
robertfrost,There were four candles and four people present.
robertfrost,"The witch was young, and beautiful (new style)."
robertfrost,And open-minded. She was free to question
robertfrost,Her gift for reading letters locked in boxes.
robertfrost,Why was it so much greater when the boxes
robertfrost,Were metal than it was when they were wooden?
robertfrost,It made the world seem so mysterious.
robertfrost,The S’ciety for Psychical Research
robertfrost,Was cognizant. Her husband was worth millions.
robertfrost,I think he owned some shares in Harvard College.)
robertfrost,New Hampshire used to have at Salem
robertfrost,"A company we called the White Corpuscles,"
robertfrost,Whose duty was at any hour of night
robertfrost,To rush in sheets and fools’ caps where they smelled
robertfrost,A thing the least bit doubtfully perscented
robertfrost,And give someone the Skipper Ireson’s Ride.
robertfrost,One each of everything as in a show-case.
robertfrost,More than enough land for a specimen
robertfrost,"You’ll say she has, but there there enters in"
robertfrost,Something else to protect her from herself.
robertfrost,There quality makes up for quantity.
robertfrost,Not even New Hampshire farms are much for sale.
robertfrost,The farm I made my home on in the mountains
robertfrost,I had to take by force rather than buy.
robertfrost,I caught the owner outdoors by himself
robertfrost,"Raking up after winter, and I said,"
robertfrost,Tm going to put you off this farm: I want it.’
robertfrost,■Where are vou going to put me? In the road?’
robertfrost,[ 203 ]
robertfrost,‘I’m going to put you on the farm next to it.’
robertfrost,‘Why won’t the farm next to it do for you?’
robertfrost,‘I like this better.’ It was really better.
robertfrost,"Apples? New Hampshire has them, but unsprayed,"
robertfrost,With no suspicion in stem-end or blossom-end
robertfrost,"Of vitriol or arsenate of lead,"
robertfrost,And so not good for anything but cider.
robertfrost,Her unpruned grapes are flung like lariats
robertfrost,Far up the birches out of reach of man.
robertfrost,"A state producing precious metals, stones."
robertfrost,And— writing; none of these except perhaps
robertfrost,The precious literature in quantity
robertfrost,Or quality to worry the producer
robertfrost,"About disposing of it. Do you know,"
robertfrost,"Considering the market, there are more"
robertfrost,Poems produced than any other thing?
robertfrost,No wonder poets sometimes have to seem
robertfrost,So much more business-like than business men.
robertfrost,Their wares are so much harder to get rid of.
robertfrost,She’s one of the two best states in the Union.
robertfrost,Vermont’s the other. And the two have been
robertfrost,Yoke-fellows in the sap-yoke from of old
robertfrost,"In many Marches. And they lie like wedges,"
robertfrost,"Thick end to thin end and thin end to thick end,"
robertfrost,And are a figure of the way the strong
robertfrost,"Of mind and strong of arm should fit together,"
robertfrost,One thick where one is thin and vice versa.
robertfrost,New Hampshire raises the Connecticut
robertfrost,"In a trout hatchery near Canada,"
robertfrost,But soon divides the river with Vermont.
robertfrost,[ 204 ]
robertfrost,Both are delightful states for their absurdly
robertfrost,"Small towns— Lost Nation, Bungey, Muddy Boo,"
robertfrost,"Poplin, Still Comers (so called not because"
robertfrost,"The place is silent all day long, nor yet"
robertfrost,Because it boasts a whisky still— because
robertfrost,It set out once to be a city and still
robertfrost,"Is only comers, cross-roads in a wood)."
robertfrost,And I remember one whose name appeared
robertfrost,Between the pictures on a movie screen
robertfrost,"Election night once in Franconia,"
robertfrost,When everything had gone Republican
robertfrost,And Democrats were sore in need of comfort:
robertfrost,"Easton goes Democratic, Wilson 4"
robertfrost,Hughes 2. And everybody to the saddest
robertfrost,"Laughed the loud laugh, the big laugh at the little"
robertfrost,"New York (five million) laughs at Manchester,"
robertfrost,Manchester (sixty or seventy thousand) laughs
robertfrost,"At Littleton (four thousand), Littleton"
robertfrost,"Laughs at Franconia (seven hundred), and"
robertfrost,"Franconia laughs, I fear,-did laugh that night-"
robertfrost,"At Easton. What has Easton left to laugh at,"
robertfrost,"And like the actress exclaim, ‘Oh, my God’ at?"
robertfrost,There’s Bungey; and for Bungey there are towns.
robertfrost,Whole townships named but without population.
robertfrost,Anything I can say about New Hampshire
robertfrost,"Will serve almost as well about Vermont,"
robertfrost,Excepting that they differ in their mountains.
robertfrost,The Vermont mountains stretch extended straight;
robertfrost,New Hampshire mountains curl up in a coil.
robertfrost,I had been coming to New Hampshire mountains.
robertfrost,And here I am and what am I to say?
robertfrost,[205]
robertfrost,Here first my theme becomes embarrassing.
robertfrost,"Emerson said, ‘The God who made New Hampshire"
robertfrost,Taunted the lofty land with little men.’
robertfrost,"Another Massachusetts poet said,"
robertfrost,1 go no more to summer in New Hampshire.
robertfrost,I’ve given up my summer place in Dublin.’
robertfrost,But when I asked to know what ailed New Hampshire
robertfrost,She said she couldn’t stand the people in it.
robertfrost,The little men (it’s Massachusetts speaking).
robertfrost,"And when I asked to know what ailed the people,"
robertfrost,"She said, ‘Go read your own books and find out.’"
robertfrost,I may as well confess myself the author
robertfrost,Of several books against the world in general.
robertfrost,To take them as against a special state
robertfrost,Or even nation’s to restrict my meaning.
robertfrost,I’m what is called a sensibilitist.
robertfrost,Or otherwise an environmentalist.
robertfrost,I refuse to adapt myself a mite
robertfrost,"To any change from hot to cold, from wet"
robertfrost,"To dry, from poor to rich, or back again."
robertfrost,I make a virtue of my suffering
robertfrost,From nearly everything that goes on round me.
robertfrost,"In other words, I know wherever I am."
robertfrost,"Being the creature of literature I am,"
robertfrost,I shall not lack for pain to keep me awake.
robertfrost,Kit Marlowe taught me how to say my prayers:
robertfrost,"‘Why, this is Hell, nor am I out of it.’"
robertfrost,"Samoa, Russia, Ireland, I complain of."
robertfrost,"No less than England, France, and Italy."
robertfrost,Because I wrote my novels in New Hampshire
robertfrost,Is no proof that I aimed them at New Hampshire.
robertfrost,When I left Massachusetts years ago
robertfrost,[ 206 ]
robertfrost,"Between two days, the reason why I sought"
robertfrost,"New flampshire, not Connecticut,"
robertfrost,"Rhode Island, New York, or Vermont was this:"
robertfrost,"Where I was living then, New Hampshire offered"
robertfrost,The nearest boundary to escape across.
robertfrost,I hadn’t an illusion in my hand-bag
robertfrost,About the people being better there
robertfrost,Than those I left behind. I thought they weren’t.
robertfrost,I thought they couldn’t be. And yet they were.
robertfrost,I’d sure had no such friends in Massachusetts
robertfrost,"As Hall of Windham, Gay of Atkinson,"
robertfrost,"Bartlett of Raymond (now of Colorado),"
robertfrost,"Harris of Derry, and Lynch of Bethlehem."
robertfrost,The glorious bards of Massachusetts seem
robertfrost,To want to make New Hampshire people over.
robertfrost,They taunt the lofty land with little men.
robertfrost,I don’t know what to say about the people.
robertfrost,For art’s sake one could almost wish them worse
robertfrost,Rather than better. How are we to write
robertfrost,The Russian novel in America
robertfrost,As long as life goes so unterribly?
robertfrost,There is the pinch from which our only outcry
robertfrost,In literature to date is heard to come.
robertfrost,We get what little misery we can
robertfrost,Out of not having cause for misery.
robertfrost,It makes the guild of novel writers sick
robertfrost,To be expected to be Dostoievskis
robertfrost,On nothing worse than too much luck and comfort.
robertfrost,"This is not sorrow, though; it’s just the vapors,"
robertfrost,And recognized as such in Russia itself
robertfrost,"Under the new regime, and so forbidden."
robertfrost,"If well it is with Russia, then feel free"
robertfrost,[ 207 ]
robertfrost,To say so or be stood against the wall
robertfrost,And shot. It’s Pollyanna now or death.
robertfrost,"This, then, is the new freedom we hear tell of;"
robertfrost,And very sensible. No state can build
robertfrost,A literature that shall at once be sound
robertfrost,And sad on a foundation of well-being.
robertfrost,To show the level of intelligence
robertfrost,Among us: it was just a Warren farmer
robertfrost,Whose horse had pulled him short up in the road
robertfrost,"By me, a stranger. This is what he said,"
robertfrost,From nothing but embarrassment and want
robertfrost,Of anything more sociable to say:
robertfrost,‘You hear those hound-dogs sing on Moosilauke?
robertfrost,Well they remind me of the hue and cry
robertfrost,We’ve heard against the Mid-Victorians
robertfrost,And never rightly understood till Bryan
robertfrost,Retired from politics and joined the chorus.
robertfrost,The matter with the Mid-Victorians
robertfrost,Seems to have been a man named John L. Darwin.
robertfrost,"‘Go ’long,’ I said to him, he to his horse."
robertfrost,I knew a man who failing as a farmer
robertfrost,"Burned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance,"
robertfrost,And spent the proceeds on a telescope
robertfrost,To satisfy a life-long curiosity
robertfrost,About our place among the infinities.
robertfrost,And how was that for other-worldliness?
robertfrost,If I must choose which I would elevate—
robertfrost,The people or the already lofty mountains.
robertfrost,I’d elevate the already lofty mountains.
robertfrost,The only fault I find with old New Hampshire
robertfrost,Is that her mountains aren’t quite high enough.
robertfrost,[ 208 ]
robertfrost,I was not always so; I’ve come to be so.
robertfrost,"How, to my sorrow, how have I attained"
robertfrost,A height from which to look down critical
robertfrost,On mountains? What has given me assurance
robertfrost,To say what height becomes New Hampshire mountains.
robertfrost,Or any mountains? Can it be some strength
robertfrost,I feel as of an earthquake in my back
robertfrost,To heave them higher to the morning star?
robertfrost,Can it be foreign travel in the Alps?
robertfrost,Or having seen and credited a moment
robertfrost,The solid molding of vast peaks of cloud
robertfrost,Behind the pitiful reality
robertfrost,"Of Lincoln, Lafayette, and Liberty?"
robertfrost,Or some such sense as says how high shall jet
robertfrost,The fountain in proportion to the basin?
robertfrost,"No, none of these has raised me to my throne"
robertfrost,Of intellectual dissatisfaction.
robertfrost,But the sad accident of having seen
robertfrost,Our actual mountains given in a map
robertfrost,Of early times as twice the height they are—
robertfrost,Ten thousand feet instead of only five—
robertfrost,Which shows how sad an accident may be.
robertfrost,Five thousand is no longer high enough.
robertfrost,Whereas I never had a good idea
robertfrost,About improving people in the world.
robertfrost,"Here I am over-fertile in suggestion,"
robertfrost,And cannot rest from planning day or night
robertfrost,How high I’d thrust the peaks in summer snow
robertfrost,To tap the upper sky and draw a flow
robertfrost,Of frosty night air on the vale below
robertfrost,Down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry.
robertfrost,The more the sensibilitist I am
robertfrost,[ 209 ]
robertfrost,The more I seem to want my mountains wild;
robertfrost,The way the wiry gang-boss liked the log-jam.
robertfrost,After he’d picked the lock and got it started.
robertfrost,He dodged a log that lifted like an arm
robertfrost,Against the sky to break his back for him.
robertfrost,"Then came in dancing, skipping, with his life"
robertfrost,"Across the roar and chaos, and the words"
robertfrost,We saw him say along the zigzag journey
robertfrost,Were doubtless as the words we heard him say
robertfrost,On coming nearer: Wasn’t she an i-deal
robertfrost,Son-of-a-bitch? You bet she was an i-deal.’
robertfrost,For all her mountains fall a little short.
robertfrost,"Her people not quite short enough for Art,"
robertfrost,"She’s still New Hampshire, a most restful state."
robertfrost,Lately in converse with a New York alec
robertfrost,"About the new school of the pseudo-phallic,"
robertfrost,I found myself in a close comer where
robertfrost,I had to make an almost funny choice.
robertfrost,"'Choose you which you will be— a prude, or puke,"
robertfrost,Mewling and puking in the public arms.’
robertfrost,‘Me for the hills where I don’t have to choose.’
robertfrost,"‘But if you had to choose, which would you be?’"
robertfrost,I wouldn’t be a prude afraid of nature.
robertfrost,I know a man who took a double ax
robertfrost,And went alone against a grove of trees;
robertfrost,"But his heart failing him, he dropped the ax"
robertfrost,And ran for shelter quoting Matthew Arnold:
robertfrost,"‘Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood;"
robertfrost,There’s been enough shed without shedding mine.
robertfrost,Remember Bimam Woodl The wood’s in flux!’
robertfrost,He had a special terror of the flux
robertfrost,[ 210 ]
robertfrost,That showed itself in dendrophobia.
robertfrost,The only decent tree had been to mill
robertfrost,"And educated into boards, he said."
robertfrost,He knew too well for any earthly use
robertfrost,"The line where man leaves off and nature starts,"
robertfrost,And never over-stepped it save in dreams.
robertfrost,He stood on the safe side of the line talking;
robertfrost,"Which is sheer Matthew Amoldism,"
robertfrost,"The cult of one who owned himself ‘a foiled,"
robertfrost,"Circuitous wanderer,’ and ‘took dejectedly"
robertfrost,His seat upon the intellectual throne.’
robertfrost,Agreed in frowning on these improvised
robertfrost,Altars the woods are full of nowadays.
robertfrost,Again as in the days when Ahaz sinned
robertfrost,By worship under green trees in the open.
robertfrost,"Scarcely a mile but that I come on one,"
robertfrost,A black-cheeked stone and stick of rain-washed charcoal
robertfrost,Even to say the groves were God’s first temples
robertfrost,Comes too near to Ahaz’ sin for safety.
robertfrost,Nothing not built with hands of course is sacred.
robertfrost,But here is not a question of what’s sacred;
robertfrost,Rather of what to face or run away from.
robertfrost,I’d hate to be a runaway from nature.
robertfrost,And neither would I choose to be a puke
robertfrost,"Who cares not what he does in company,"
robertfrost,"And, when he can’t do anything, falls back"
robertfrost,"On words, and tries his worst to make words speak"
robertfrost,"Louder than actions, and sometimes achieves it."
robertfrost,It seems a narrow choice the age insists on.
robertfrost,"How about being a good Greek, for instance?"
robertfrost,"That course, they tell me, isn’t offered this year."
robertfrost,"‘Come, but this isn’t choosing— puke or prude?’"
robertfrost,"Well, if I have to choose one or the other,"
robertfrost,[ 211 ]
robertfrost,I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer
robertfrost,With an income in cash of say a thousand
robertfrost,(From say a publisher in New York City).
robertfrost,"It’s restful to arrive at a decision,"
robertfrost,And restful just to think about New Hampshire.
robertfrost,At present I am living in Vermont.
robertfrost,[ 212 ]
robertfrost,A STAR IN A STONE-BOAT
robertfrost,For Lincoln MaeVeagh
robertfrost,Never tell me that not one star of all
robertfrost,That slip from heaven at night and softly fall
robertfrost,Has been picked up with stones to build a wall.
robertfrost,"Some laborer found one faded and stone cold,"
robertfrost,And saving that its weight suggested gold.
robertfrost,"And tugged it from his first too certain hold,"
robertfrost,He noticed nothing in it to remark.
robertfrost,He was not used to handling stars thrown dark
robertfrost,And lifeless from an interrupted arc.
robertfrost,He did not recognize in that smooth coal
robertfrost,The one thing palpable beside the soul
robertfrost,To penetrate the air in which we roll.
robertfrost,He did not see how like a flying thing
robertfrost,"It brooded ant-eggs, and had one large wing,"
robertfrost,"One not so large for flying in a ring,"
robertfrost,"And a long Bird of Paradise’s tail,"
robertfrost,(Though these when not in use to fly and trail
robertfrost,It drew back in its body like a snail);
robertfrost,"Nor know that he might move it from the spot,"
robertfrost,The harm was done; from having been star-shot
robertfrost,The very nature of the soil was hot
robertfrost,"And burning to yield flowers instead of grain,"
robertfrost,Flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain
robertfrost,Poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain.
robertfrost,[ 213 ]
robertfrost,"He moved it roughly with an iron bar,"
robertfrost,He loaded an old stone-boat with the star
robertfrost,"And not, as you might think, a flying car,"
robertfrost,Such as even poets would admit perforce
robertfrost,More practical than Pegasus the horse
robertfrost,If it could put a star back in its course.
robertfrost,He dragged it through the plowed ground at a pace
robertfrost,But faintly reminiscent of the race
robertfrost,Of jostling rock in interstellar space.
robertfrost,"It went for building stone, and I, as though"
robertfrost,"Commanded in a dream, forever go"
robertfrost,To right the wrong that this should have been so.
robertfrost,"Yet ask where else it could have gone as well,"
robertfrost,I do not know— I cannot stop to tell:
robertfrost,He might have left it lying where it fell.
robertfrost,From following walls I never lift my eye
robertfrost,Except at night to places in the sky
robertfrost,Where showers of charted meteors let fly.
robertfrost,"Some may know what they seek in school and church,"
robertfrost,And why they seek it there; for what I search
robertfrost,"I must go measuring stone walls, perch on perch;"
robertfrost,Sure that though not a star of death and birth.
robertfrost,"So not to be compared, perhaps, in worth"
robertfrost,"To such resorts of life as Mars and Earth,"
robertfrost,[ 214 ]
robertfrost,"Though not, I say, a star of death and sin"
robertfrost,"It yet has poles, and only needs a spin"
robertfrost,To show its worldly nature and begin
robertfrost,To chafe and shuffle in my calloused palm
robertfrost,And run off in strange tangents with my arm
robertfrost,As fish do with the line in first alarm.
robertfrost,"Such as it is, it promises the prize"
robertfrost,Of the one world complete in any size
robertfrost,"That I am like to compass, fool or wise."

robertfrost,THE CENSUS-TAKER
robertfrost,I came an errand one cloud-blowing evening
robertfrost,"To a slab-built, black-paper-covered house"
robertfrost,Of one room and one window and one door.
robertfrost,The only dwelling in a waste cut over
robertfrost,A hundred square miles round it in the mountai n s:
robertfrost,And that not dwelt in now by men or women.
robertfrost,"(It never had been dwelt in, though, by women,"
robertfrost,So what is this I make a sorrow of?)
robertfrost,I came as census-taker to the waste
robertfrost,To count the people in it and found none.
robertfrost,"None in the hundred miles, none in the house."
robertfrost,"Where I came last with some hope, but not much"
robertfrost,After hours’ overlooking from the cliffs
robertfrost,An emptiness flayed to the very stone.
robertfrost,I found no people that dared show themselves.
robertfrost,None not in hiding from the outward eye.
robertfrost,"The time was autumn, but how anyone"
robertfrost,Could tell the time of year when every tree
robertfrost,That could have dropped a leaf was down itself
robertfrost,And nothing but the stump of it was left
robertfrost,Now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch;
robertfrost,And every tree up stood a rotting trunk
robertfrost,"Without a single leaf to spend on autumn,"
robertfrost,Or branch to whistle after what was spent.
robertfrost,Perhaps the wind the more without the help
robertfrost,Of breathing trees said something of the time
robertfrost,Of year or day the way it swung a door
robertfrost,"Forever off the latch, as if rude men"
robertfrost,Passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him
robertfrost,For the next one to open for himself.
robertfrost,I counted nine I had no right to count
robertfrost,[ 216 ]
robertfrost,(But this was dreamy unofficial counting)
robertfrost,Before I made the tenth across the threshold.
robertfrost,Where was my supper? Where was anyone’s?
robertfrost,No lamp was lit. Nothing was on the table.
robertfrost,The stove was cold— the stove was off the chimney-
robertfrost,And down by one side where it lacked a leg.
robertfrost,The people that had loudly passed the door
robertfrost,Were people to the ear but not the eye.
robertfrost,They were not on the table with their elbows.
robertfrost,They were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks.
robertfrost,I saw no men there and no bones of men there.
robertfrost,I armed myself against such bones as might be
robertfrost,With the pitch-blackened stub of an ax-handle
robertfrost,I picked up off the straw-dust covered floor.
robertfrost,"Not bones, but the ill-fitted window rattled."
robertfrost,The door was still because I held it shut
robertfrost,While I thought what to do that could be done—
robertfrost,About the house— about the people not there.
robertfrost,This house in one year fallen to decay
robertfrost,Filled me with no less sorrow than the houses
robertfrost,Fallen to ruin in ten thousand years
robertfrost,Where Asia wedges Africa from Europe.
robertfrost,Nothing was left to do that I could see
robertfrost,Unless to find that there was no one there
robertfrost,"And declare to the cliffs too far for echo,"
robertfrost,‘The place is desert and let whoso lurks
robertfrost,"In silence, if in this he is aggrieved."
robertfrost,Break silence now or be forever silent.
robertfrost,Let him say why it should not be declared so.’
robertfrost,The melancholy of having to count souls
robertfrost,Where they grow fewer and fewer every year
robertfrost,Is extreme where they shrink to none at all.
robertfrost,It must be I want life to go on living.

robertfrost,THE STAR-SPLITTER
robertfrost,‘You know Orion always comes up sideways.
robertfrost,Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains
robertfrost,"And rising on his hands, he looks in on me"
robertfrost,Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something
robertfrost,"I should have done by daylight, and indeed,"
robertfrost,"After the ground is frozen, I should have done"
robertfrost,"Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful"
robertfrost,Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney
robertfrost,To make fun of my way of doing things.
robertfrost,Or else fun of Orion’s having caught me.
robertfrost,"Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights"
robertfrost,These forces are obliged to pay respect to?’
robertfrost,So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk
robertfrost,Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming.
robertfrost,"Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming,"
robertfrost,He burned his house down for the fire insurance
robertfrost,And spent the proceeds on a telescope
robertfrost,To satisfy a life-long curiosity
robertfrost,About our place among the infinities.
robertfrost,“What do you want with one of those blame things?’
robertfrost,I asked him well beforehand. ‘Don’t you get one!’
robertfrost,‘Don’t call it blamed; there isn’t anything
robertfrost,More blameless in the sense of being less
robertfrost,"A weapon in our human fight,’ he said."
robertfrost,‘I’ll have one if I sell my farm to buy it.’
robertfrost,There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground
robertfrost,"And plowed between the rocks he couldn’t move,"
robertfrost,Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years
robertfrost,Trying to sell his farm and then not selling.
robertfrost,He burned his house down for the fire insurance
robertfrost,[ 218 ]
robertfrost,And bought the telescope with what it came to.
robertfrost,He had been heard to say by several:
robertfrost,The best thing that we re put here for’s to see;
robertfrost,The strongest thing that’s given us to see with’s
robertfrost,A telescope. Someone in every town
robertfrost,Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one.
robertfrost,In Littleton it may as well be me.’
robertfrost,After such loose talk it was no surprise
robertfrost,When he did what he did and burned his house down
robertfrost,Mean laughter went about the town that day
robertfrost,To let him know we weren’t the least imposed on.
robertfrost,And he could wait— we’d see to him tomorrow.
robertfrost,But the first thing next morning we reflected
robertfrost,If one by one we counted people out
robertfrost,"For the least sin, it wouldn’t take us long"
robertfrost,To get so we had no one left to five with.
robertfrost,For to be social is to be forgiving.
robertfrost,"Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,"
robertfrost,"We don’t cut off from coming to church suppers,"
robertfrost,But what we miss we go to him and ask for.
robertfrost,"He promptly gives it back, that is if still"
robertfrost,"Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of."
robertfrost,It wouldn’t do to be too hard on Brad
robertfrost,About his telescope. Beyond the age
robertfrost,"Of being given one for Christmas gift,"
robertfrost,He had to take the best way he knew how
robertfrost,"To find himself in one. Well, all we said was"
robertfrost,He took a strange thing to be roguish over.
robertfrost,"Some sympathy was wasted on the house,"
robertfrost,A good old-timer dating back along;
robertfrost,But a house isn’t sentient; the house
robertfrost,"Didn’t feel anything. And if it did,"
robertfrost,[ 219 ]
robertfrost,"Why not regard it as a sacrifice,"
robertfrost,"And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,"
robertfrost,Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?
robertfrost,Out of a house and so out of a farm
robertfrost,At one stroke (of a match). Brad had to turn
robertfrost,"To earn a living on the Concord railroad,"
robertfrost,As under-ticket-agent at a station
robertfrost,"Where his job, when he wasn’t selling tickets,"
robertfrost,"Was setting out up track and down, not plants"
robertfrost,"As on a farm, but planets, evening stars"
robertfrost,That varied in their hue from red to green.
robertfrost,He got a good glass for six hundred dollars.
robertfrost,His new job gave him leisure for star-gazing.
robertfrost,Often he bid me come and have a look
robertfrost,"Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside."
robertfrost,At a star quaking in the other end.
robertfrost,I recollect a night of broken clouds
robertfrost,And underfoot snow melted down to ice.
robertfrost,And melting further in the wind to mud.
robertfrost,Bradford and I had out the telescope.
robertfrost,"We spread our two legs as we spread its three,"
robertfrost,Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it.
robertfrost,And standing at our leisure till the day broke.
robertfrost,Said some of the best things we ever said.
robertfrost,"That telescope was christened the Star-splitter,"
robertfrost,Because it didn’t do a thing but split
robertfrost,A star in two or three the way you split
robertfrost,A globule of quicksilver in your hand
robertfrost,With one stroke of your finger in the middle.
robertfrost,It’s a star-splitter if there ever was one
robertfrost,And ought to do some good if splitting stars
robertfrost,’Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood.
robertfrost,[ 220 ]
robertfrost,"We’ve looked and looked, but after all where are we?"
robertfrost,Do we know any better where we are.
robertfrost,And how it stands between the night tonight
robertfrost,And a man with a smoky lantern chimney?
robertfrost,How different from the way it ever stood?
robertfrost,MAPLE
robertfrost,Her teacher’s certainty it must be Mabel
robertfrost,Made Maple first take notice of her name.
robertfrost,She asked her father and he told her ‘Maple-
robertfrost,Maple is right.’
robertfrost,‘But teacher told the school
robertfrost,There’s no such name.’
robertfrost,‘Teachers don’t know as much
robertfrost,"As fathers about children, you tell teacher."
robertfrost,You tell her that it’s M-A-P-L-E.
robertfrost,You ask her if she knows a maple tree.
robertfrost,"Well, you were named after a maple tree."
robertfrost,Your mother named you. You and she just saw
robertfrost,Each other in passing in the room upstairs.
robertfrost,"One coming this way into life, and one"
robertfrost,Going the other out of life— you know?
robertfrost,So you can’t have much recollection of her.
robertfrost,She had been having a long look at you.
robertfrost,She put her finger in your cheek so hard
robertfrost,"It must have made your dimple there, and said,"
robertfrost,"“Maple.” I said it too : “Yes, for her name.”"
robertfrost,She nodded. So we’re sure there’s no mistake.
robertfrost,"I don’t know what she wanted it to mean,"
robertfrost,But it seems like some word she left to bid you
robertfrost,Be a good girl— be like a maple tree.
robertfrost,How like a maple tree’s for us to guess.
robertfrost,Or for a little girl to guess sometime.
robertfrost,Not now— at least I shouldn’t try too hard now.
robertfrost,By and by I will tell you all I know
robertfrost,"About the different trees, and something, too,"
robertfrost,[ 222 ]
robertfrost,About your mother that perhaps may help/
robertfrost,Dangerous self -arousing words to sow.
robertfrost,Luckily all she wanted of her name then
robertfrost,"Was to rebuke her teacher with it next day,"
robertfrost,And give the teacher a scare as from her father.
robertfrost,"Anything further had been wasted on her,"
robertfrost,Or so he tried to think to avoid blame.
robertfrost,She would forget it. She all but forgot it.
robertfrost,What he sowed with her slept so long a sleep.
robertfrost,"And came so near death in the dark of years,"
robertfrost,That when it woke and came to life again
robertfrost,The flower was different from the parent seed.
robertfrost,"It came back vaguely at the glass one day,"
robertfrost,"As she stood saying her name over aloud,"
robertfrost,Striking it gently across her lowered eyes
robertfrost,To make it go well with the way she looked.
robertfrost,What was it about her name? Its strangeness lay
robertfrost,"In having too much meaning. Other names,"
robertfrost,"As Lesley, Carol, Irma, Marjorie,"
robertfrost,"Signified nothing. Rose could have a meaning,"
robertfrost,But hadn’t as it went. (She knew a Rose.)
robertfrost,This difference from other names it was
robertfrost,Made people notice it— and notice her.
robertfrost,"(They either noticed it, or got it wrong.)"
robertfrost,Her problem was to find out what it asked
robertfrost,In dress or manner of the girl who bore it.
robertfrost,If she could form some notion of her mother—
robertfrost,"What she had thought was lovely, and what good."
robertfrost,This was her mother’s childhood home;
robertfrost,"The house one story high in front, three stories"
robertfrost,On the end it presented to the road.
robertfrost,(The arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar.)
robertfrost,"Her mother s bedroom was her father’s yet,"
robertfrost,[223J
robertfrost,Where she could watch her mother’s picture fading.
robertfrost,Once she found for a bookmark in the Bible
robertfrost,A maple leaf she thought must have been laid
robertfrost,In wait for her there. She read every word
robertfrost,Of the two pages it was pressed between
robertfrost,As if it was her mother speaking to her.
robertfrost,But forgot to put the leaf back in closing
robertfrost,And lost the place never to read again.
robertfrost,"She was sure, though, there had been nothing in it."
robertfrost,"So she looked for herself, as everyone"
robertfrost,"Looks for himself, more or less outwardly."
robertfrost,"And her self-seeking, fitful though it was."
robertfrost,"May still have been what led her on to read,"
robertfrost,"And think a little, and get some city schooling."
robertfrost,"She learned shorthand, whatever shorthand may"
robertfrost,Have had to do with it— she sometimes wondered
robertfrost,"So, till she found herself in a strange place"
robertfrost,"For the name Maple to have brought her to,"
robertfrost,"Taking dictation on a paper pad,"
robertfrost,And in the pauses when she raised her eyes
robertfrost,Watching out of a nineteenth story window
robertfrost,An airship laboring with unship-like motion
robertfrost,And a vague all-disturbing roar above the river
robertfrost,Beyond the highest city built with hands.
robertfrost,Someone was saying in such natural tones
robertfrost,"She almost wrote the words down on her knee,"
robertfrost,‘Do you know you remind me of a tree—
robertfrost,A maple tree?*
robertfrost,‘Because my name is Maple?’
robertfrost,Isn’t it Mabel? I thought it was Mabel.’
robertfrost,[ 224 ]
robertfrost,‘No doubt you’ve heard the office call me Mabel.
robertfrost,I have to let them call me what they like.’
robertfrost,They were both stirred that he should have divined
robertfrost,Without the name her personal mystery.
robertfrost,It made it seem as if there must be something
robertfrost,"She must have missed herself. So they were married,"
robertfrost,And took the fancy home with them to live by.
robertfrost,They went on pilgrimage once to her father’s
robertfrost,"(The house one story high in front, three stories"
robertfrost,On the side it presented to the road)
robertfrost,To see if there was not some special tree
robertfrost,"She might have overlooked. They could find none,"
robertfrost,"Not so much as a single tree for shade,"
robertfrost,Let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard.
robertfrost,She told him of the bookmark maple leaf
robertfrost,"In the big Bible, and all she remembered"
robertfrost,Of the place marked with it— “Wave offering.
robertfrost,"Something about wave offering, it said.’"
robertfrost,"'You’ve never asked your father outright, have you?’"
robertfrost,"‘I have, and been put off sometime, I think.’"
robertfrost,(This was her faded memory of the way
robertfrost,Once long ago her father had put himself off.)
robertfrost,‘Because no telling but it may have been
robertfrost,Something between your father and your mother
robertfrost,Not meant for us at all.’
robertfrost,‘Not meant for me?
robertfrost,Where would the fairness be in giving me
robertfrost,[ 225 ]
robertfrost,"A name to carry for life, and never know"
robertfrost,The secret of?’
robertfrost,‘And then it may have been
robertfrost,Something a father couldn’t tell a daughter
robertfrost,As well as could a mother. And again
robertfrost,It may have been their one lapse into fancy
robertfrost,’Twould be too bad to make him sorry for
robertfrost,By bringing it up to him when he was too old.
robertfrost,"Your father feels us round him with our questing,"
robertfrost,And holds us off unnecessarily.
robertfrost,As if he didn’t know what little thing
robertfrost,Might lead us on to a discovery.
robertfrost,It was as personal as he could be
robertfrost,About the way he saw it was with you
robertfrost,"To say your mother, had she lived, would be"
robertfrost,As far again as from being bom to bearing.’
robertfrost,"‘Just one look more with what you say in mind,"
robertfrost,And I give up’; which last look came to nothing.
robertfrost,"But, though they now gave up the search forever,"
robertfrost,They clung to what one had seen in the other
robertfrost,By inspiration. It proved there was something.
robertfrost,They kept their thoughts away from when the maples
robertfrost,"Stood uniform in buckets, and the steam"
robertfrost,Of sap and snow rolled off the sugar house.
robertfrost,When they made her related to the maples.
robertfrost,It was the tree the autumn fire ran through
robertfrost,"And swept of leathern leaves, but left the bark"
robertfrost,"Unscorched, unblackened, even, by any smoke."
robertfrost,They always took their holidays in autumn.
robertfrost,"Once they came on a maple in a glade,"
robertfrost,"Standing alone with smooth arms lifted up,"
robertfrost,[ 226 ]
robertfrost,And every leaf of foliage she’d worn
robertfrost,Laid scarlet and pale pink about her feet.
robertfrost,But its age kept them from considering this one.
robertfrost,Twenty-five years ago at Maple’s naming
robertfrost,It hardly could have been a two-leaved seedling
robertfrost,The next cow might have licked up out at pasture.
robertfrost,Could it have been another maple like it?
robertfrost,They hovered for a moment near discovery.
robertfrost,"Figurative enough to see the symbol,"
robertfrost,But lacking faith in anything to mean
robertfrost,The same at different times to different people.
robertfrost,Perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept them
robertfrost,From thinking it could be a thing so bridal.
robertfrost,And anyway it came too late for Maple.
robertfrost,She used her hands to cover up her eyes.
robertfrost,We would not see the secret if we could now:
robertfrost,We are not looking for it any more.’
robertfrost,"Thus had a name with meaning, given in death,"
robertfrost,"Made a girl’s marriage, and ruled in her life."
robertfrost,No matter that the meaning was not clear.
robertfrost,A name with meaning could bring up a child.
robertfrost,Taking the child out of the parents’ hands.
robertfrost,"Better a meaningless name, I should say."
robertfrost,As leaving more to nature and happy chance.
robertfrost,Name children some names and see what you do.

robertfrost,THE AX-HELVE
robertfrost,I’ve known ere now an interfering branch
robertfrost,Of alder catch my lifted ax behind me.
robertfrost,"But that was in the woods, to hold my hand"
robertfrost,From striking at another alder’s roots.
robertfrost,"And that was, as I say, an alder branch."
robertfrost,"This was a man, Baptiste, who stole one day"
robertfrost,Behind me on the snow in my own yard
robertfrost,Where I was working at the chopping-block.
robertfrost,And cutting nothing not cut down already.
robertfrost,He caught my ax expertly on the rise.
robertfrost,When all my strength put forth was in his favor.
robertfrost,"Held it a moment where it was, to calm me."
robertfrost,Then took it from me— and I let him take it.
robertfrost,I didn’t know him well enough to know
robertfrost,What it was all about. There might be something
robertfrost,He had in mind to say to a bad neighbor
robertfrost,He might prefer to say to him disarmed.
robertfrost,But all he had to tell me in French-English
robertfrost,"Was what he thought of— not me, but my ax,"
robertfrost,Me only as I took my ax to heart.
robertfrost,It was the bad ax-helve someone had sold me—
robertfrost,"'Made on machine,’ he said, plowing the grain"
robertfrost,With a thick thumbnail to show how it ran
robertfrost,Across the handle’s long drawn serpentine.
robertfrost,Like the two strokes across a dollar sign.
robertfrost,"‘You give her one good crack, she’s snap raght off."
robertfrost,Den where’s your hax-ead flying t’rough de hair?’
robertfrost,"Admitted; and yet, what was that to him?"
robertfrost,Come on my house and I put you one in
robertfrost,What’s las’ awhile— good hick’ry what’s grow crooked.
robertfrost,[ 228 ]
robertfrost,"De second growt’ I cut myself— tough, tough!’"
robertfrost,Something to sell? That wasn’t how it sounded.
robertfrost,‘Den when you say you come? It’s cost you nothing.
robertfrost,Tonaght?’
robertfrost,As well tonight as any night.
robertfrost,Beyond an over-warmth of kitchen stove
robertfrost,My welcome differed from no other welcome.
robertfrost,Baptiste knew best why I was where I was.
robertfrost,"So long as he would leave enough unsaid,"
robertfrost,I shouldn’t mind his being overjoyed
robertfrost,(If overjoyed he was) at having got me
robertfrost,Where I must judge if what he knew about an ax
robertfrost,T hat not everybody else knew was to count
robertfrost,For nothing in the measure of a neighbor.
robertfrost,"Hard if, though cast away for life with Yankees,"
robertfrost,A Frenchman couldn’t get his human rating!
robertfrost,Mrs. Baptiste came in and rocked a chair
robertfrost,That had as many motions as the world:
robertfrost,"One back and forward, in and out of shadow,"
robertfrost,"That got her nowhere; one more gradual,"
robertfrost,"Sideways, that would have run her on the stove"
robertfrost,"In time, had she not realized her danger"
robertfrost,"And caught herself up bodily, chair and all."
robertfrost,And set herself back where she started from.
robertfrost,‘She ain’t spick too much Henglish— dats too bad.
robertfrost,"I was afraid, in brightening first on me."
robertfrost,"Then on Baptiste, as if she understood"
robertfrost,[229J
robertfrost,"What passed between us, she was only feigning."
robertfrost,Baptiste was anxious for her; but no more
robertfrost,"Than for himself, so placed he couldn’t hope"
robertfrost,To keep his bargain of the morning with me
robertfrost,In time to keep me from suspecting him
robertfrost,Of really never having meant to keep it.
robertfrost,"Needlessly soon he had his ax-helves out,"
robertfrost,"A quiverful to choose from, since he wished me"
robertfrost,"To have the best he had, or had to spare—"
robertfrost,"Not for me to ask which, when what he took"
robertfrost,Had beauties he had to point me out at length
robertfrost,To insure their not being wasted on me.
robertfrost,"He liked to have it slender as a whipstock,"
robertfrost,"Free from the least knot, equal to the strain"
robertfrost,Of bending like a sword across the knee.
robertfrost,He showed me that the lines of a good helve
robertfrost,Were native to the grain before the knife
robertfrost,"Expressed them, and its curves were no false curves"
robertfrost,Put on it from without. And there its strength lay
robertfrost,For the hard work. He chafed its long white body
robertfrost,From end to end with his rough hand shut round it.
robertfrost,He tried it at the eye-hole in the ax-head.
robertfrost,"‘Hahn, hahn,’ he mused, ‘don’t need much taking down."
robertfrost,Baptiste knew how to make a short job long
robertfrost,"For love of it, and yet not waste time either."
robertfrost,"Do you know, what we talked about was knowledge?"
robertfrost,Baptiste on his defense about the children
robertfrost,"He kept from school, or did his best to keep—"
robertfrost,Whatever school and children and our doubts
robertfrost,Of laid-on education had to do
robertfrost,With the curves of his ax-helves and his having
robertfrost,[ 230 ]
robertfrost,Used these unscrupulously to bring me
robertfrost,To see for once the inside of his house.
robertfrost,"Was I desired in friendship, partly as someone"
robertfrost,"To leave it to, whether the right to hold"
robertfrost,Such doubts of education should depend
robertfrost,Upon the education of those who held them?
robertfrost,But now he brushed the shavings from his knee
robertfrost,"And stood the ax there on its horse’s hoof,"
robertfrost,"Erect, but not without its waves, as when"
robertfrost,"The snake stood up for evil in the Garden,—"
robertfrost,"Top-heavy with a heaviness his short,"
robertfrost,"Thick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down"
robertfrost,And in a little— a French touch in that.
robertfrost,"Baptiste drew back and squinted at it, pleased;"
robertfrost,‘See how she’s cock her head!’

robertfrost,Having a wheel and four legs of its own
robertfrost,Has never availed the cumbersome grindstone
robertfrost,To get it anywhere that I can see.
robertfrost,"These hands have helped it go, and even race;"
robertfrost,"Not all the motion, though, they ever lent,"
robertfrost,"Not all the miles it may have thought it went,"
robertfrost,Have got it one step from the starting place.
robertfrost,It stands beside the same old apple tree.

robertfrost,"Upon it now, its feet are fast in snow."
robertfrost,"All other farm machinery’s gone in,"

robertfrost,For months it hasn’t known the taste of steel.

robertfrost,"But standing outdoors hungry, in the cold,"
robertfrost,"Except in towns at night, is not a sin."
robertfrost,"And, anyway, its standing in the yard"
robertfrost,Under a ruinous live apple tree
robertfrost,Has nothing any more to do with me.
robertfrost,Except that I remember how of old
robertfrost,"One summer day, all day I drove it hard."
robertfrost,"And someone mounted on it rode it hard,"
robertfrost,And he and I between us ground a blade.
robertfrost,"I gave it the preliminary spin,"
robertfrost,And poured on water (tears it might have been).
robertfrost,"And when it almost gaily jumped and flowed,"
robertfrost,"A Father-Time-like man got on and rode,"
robertfrost,Armed with a scythe and spectacles that glowed.
robertfrost,[ 232 ]
robertfrost,He turned on will-power to increase the load
robertfrost,"And slow me down— and I abruptly slowed,"
robertfrost,Like coming to a sudden railroad station.
robertfrost,I changed from hand to hand in desperation.
robertfrost,I wondered what machine of ages gone
robertfrost,This represented an improvement on.
robertfrost,For all I knew it may have sharpened spears
robertfrost,And arrowheads itself. Much use for years
robertfrost,Had gradually worn it an oblate
robertfrost,"Spheroid that kicked and struggled in its gait,"
robertfrost,Appearing to return me hate for hate;
robertfrost,(But I forgive it now as easily
robertfrost,As any other boyhood enemy
robertfrost,Whose pride has failed to get him anywhere).
robertfrost,I wondered who it was the man thought ground—
robertfrost,The one who held the wheel back or the one
robertfrost,Who gave his life to keep it going round?
robertfrost,I wondered if he really thought it fair
robertfrost,For him to have the say when we were done.
robertfrost,Such were the bitter thoughts to which I turned.
robertfrost,Not for myself was I so much concerned.
robertfrost,"Oh no!— although, of course, I could have found"
robertfrost,A better way to pass the afternoon
robertfrost,"Than grinding discord out of a grindstone,"
robertfrost,And beating insects at their gritty tune.
robertfrost,Nor was I for the man so much concerned.
robertfrost,Once when the grindstone almost jumped its bearing
robertfrost,It looked as if he might be badly thrown
robertfrost,"And wounded on his blade. So far from caring,"
robertfrost,"I laughed inside, and only cranked the faster,"
robertfrost,(It ran as if it wasn’t greased but glued);
robertfrost,I’d welcome any moderate disaster
robertfrost,[ 233 ]
robertfrost,That might be calculated to postpone
robertfrost,What evidently nothing could conclude.
robertfrost,The thing that made me more and more afraid
robertfrost,Was that we’d ground it sharp and hadn’t known.
robertfrost,And now were only wasting precious blade.
robertfrost,And when he raised it dripping once and tried
robertfrost,"The creepy edge of it with wary touch,"
robertfrost,And viewed it over his glasses funny-eyed.
robertfrost,Only disinterestedly to decide
robertfrost,"It needed a turn more, I could have cried"
robertfrost,Wasn’t there danger of a turn too much?
robertfrost,Mightn’t we make it worse instead of better?
robertfrost,I was for leaving something to the whetter.
robertfrost,What if it wasn’t all it should be? I’d
robertfrost,Be satisfied if he’d be satisfied.

robertfrost,PAUL’S WIFE
robertfrost,To drive Paul out of any lumber camp
robertfrost,"All that was needed was to say to him,"
robertfrost,"‘How is the wife, Paul?’— and he’d disappear."
robertfrost,Some said it was because he had no wife.
robertfrost,And hated to be twitted on the subject;
robertfrost,Others because he’d come within a day
robertfrost,"Or so of having one, and then been jilted;"
robertfrost,"Others because he’d had one once, a good one,"
robertfrost,Who’d run away with someone else and left him;
robertfrost,And others still because he had one now
robertfrost,"He only had to be reminded of,—"
robertfrost,He was all duty to her in a minute:
robertfrost,He had to run right off to look her up.
robertfrost,"As if to say, ‘That’s so, how is my wife?"
robertfrost,I hope she isn’t getting into mischief.’
robertfrost,No one was anxious to get rid of Paul.
robertfrost,He’d been the hero of the mountain camps
robertfrost,"Ever since, just to show them, he had slipped"
robertfrost,"The bark of a whole tamarack off whole,"
robertfrost,As clean as boys do oflF a willow twig
robertfrost,To make a willow whistle on a Sunday
robertfrost,In April by subsiding meadow brooks.
robertfrost,They seemed to ask him just to see him go.
robertfrost,"How is the wife, Paul?’ and he always went."
robertfrost,He never stopped to murder anyone
robertfrost,Who asked the question. He just disappeared—
robertfrost,Nobody knew in what direction.
robertfrost,Although it wasn’t usually long
robertfrost,Before they heard of him in some new camp.
robertfrost,The same Paul at the same old feats of logging.
robertfrost,The question everywhere was why should Paul
robertfrost,[ 285 ]
robertfrost,Object to being asked a civil question—
robertfrost,A man you could say almost anything to
robertfrost,Short of a fighting word. You have the answers.
robertfrost,And there was one more not so fair to Paul:
robertfrost,That Paul had married a wife not his equal.
robertfrost,Paul was ashamed of her. To match a hero.
robertfrost,She would have had to be a heroine;
robertfrost,Instead of which she was some half-breed squaw.
robertfrost,"But if the story Murphy told was true,"
robertfrost,She wasn’t anything to be ashamed of.
robertfrost,You know Paul could do wonders. Everyone’s
robertfrost,Heard how he thrashed the horses on a load
robertfrost,That wouldn’t budge until they simply stretched
robertfrost,Their rawhide harness from the load to camp.
robertfrost,"Paul told the boss the load would be all right,"
robertfrost,‘The sun will bring your load in’— and it did—
robertfrost,By shrinking the rawhide to natural length.
robertfrost,That’s what is called a stretcher. But I guess
robertfrost,The one about his jumping so’s to land
robertfrost,With both his feet at once against the ceiling.
robertfrost,And then land safely right side up again.
robertfrost,"Back on the floor, is fact or pretty near fact."
robertfrost,"Well, this is such a yam. Paul sawed his wife"
robertfrost,"Out of a white-pine log. Murphy was there,"
robertfrost,"And, as you might say, saw the lady bom."
robertfrost,Paul worked at anything in lumbering.
robertfrost,He’d been hard at it taking boards away
robertfrost,For— I forget— the last ambitious sawyer
robertfrost,To want to find out if he couldn’t pile
robertfrost,The lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy.
robertfrost,"They’d sliced the first slab off a big butt log,"
robertfrost,And the sawyer had slammed the carriage back
robertfrost,[ 236 ]
robertfrost,To slam end on again against the saw teeth.
robertfrost,To judge them by the way they caught themselves
robertfrost,"When they saw what had happened to the log,"
robertfrost,They must have had a guilty expectation
robertfrost,Something was going to go with their slambanging.
robertfrost,Something had left a broad black streak of grease
robertfrost,On the new wood the whole length of the log
robertfrost,"Except, perhaps, a foot at either end."
robertfrost,"But when Paul put his finger in the grease,"
robertfrost,"It wasn’t grease at all, but a long slot."
robertfrost,The log was hollow. They were sawing pine.
robertfrost,‘First time I ever saw a hollow pine.
robertfrost,That comes of having Paul around the place.
robertfrost,"Take it to hell for me,’ the sawyer said."
robertfrost,"Everyone had to have a look at it,"
robertfrost,And tell Paul what he ought to do about it.
robertfrost,"(They treated it as his.) “You take a jack-knife,"
robertfrost,"And spread the opening, and you’ve got a dug-out"
robertfrost,All dug to go a-fishing in.’ To Paul
robertfrost,The hollow looked too sound and clean and empty
robertfrost,Ever to have housed birds or beasts or bees.
robertfrost,There was no entrance for them to get in by.
robertfrost,It looked to him like some new kind of hollow
robertfrost,He thought he’d better take his jack-knife to.
robertfrost,So after work that evening he came back
robertfrost,And let enough light into it by cutting
robertfrost,To see if it was empty. He made out in there
robertfrost,"A slender length of pith, or was it pith?"
robertfrost,It might have been the skin a snake had cast
robertfrost,And left stood up on end inside the tree
robertfrost,The hundred years the tree must have been growing.
robertfrost,"More cutting and he had this in both hands,"
robertfrost,"And, looking from it to the pond nearby,"
robertfrost,[ 237 ]
robertfrost,Paul wondered how it would respond to water.
robertfrost,"Not a breeze stirred, but just the breath of air"
robertfrost,He made in walking slowly to the beach
robertfrost,Blew it once off his hands and almost broke it.
robertfrost,He laid it at the edge where it could drink.
robertfrost,At the first drink it rustled and grew limp.
robertfrost,At the next drink it grew invisible.
robertfrost,"Paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers,"
robertfrost,And thought it must have melted. It was gone.
robertfrost,"And then beyond the open water, dim with midges,"
robertfrost,Where the log drive lay pressed against the boom.
robertfrost,"It slowly rose a person, rose a girl,"
robertfrost,Her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet.
robertfrost,"Who, leaning on a log looked back at Paul."
robertfrost,And that made Paul in turn look back
robertfrost,To see if it was anyone behind him
robertfrost,That she was looking at instead of him.
robertfrost,"Murphy had been there watching all the time,"
robertfrost,But from a shed where neither of them could see him.
robertfrost,There was a moment of suspense in birth
robertfrost,"When the girl seemed too water-logged to five,"
robertfrost,Before she caught her first breath with a gasp
robertfrost,And laughed. Then she climbed slowly to her feet.
robertfrost,And walked off talking to herself or Paul
robertfrost,"Across the logs like backs of alligators,"
robertfrost,Paul taking after her around the pond.
robertfrost,Next evening Murphy and some other fellows
robertfrost,"Got drunk, and tracked the pair up Catamount,"
robertfrost,From the bare top of which there is a view
robertfrost,To other hills across a kettle valley.
robertfrost,"And there, well after dark, let Murphy tell it."
robertfrost,They saw Paul and his creature keeping house.
robertfrost,[ 238 ]
robertfrost,It was the only glimpse that anyone
robertfrost,Has had of Paul and her since Murphy saw them
robertfrost,Falling in love across the twilight mill-pond.
robertfrost,More than a mile across the wilderness
robertfrost,They sat together halfway up a cliff
robertfrost,"In a small niche let into it, the girl"
robertfrost,"Brightly, as if a star played on the place,"
robertfrost,"Paul darkly, like her shadow. All the light"
robertfrost,"Was from the girl herself, though, not from a star."
robertfrost,As was apparent from what happened next.
robertfrost,"All those great ruffians put their throats together,"
robertfrost,"And let out a loud yell, and threw a bottle,"
robertfrost,As a brute tribute of respect to beauty.
robertfrost,Of course the bottle fell short by a mile.
robertfrost,But the shout reached the girl and put her light out.
robertfrost,"She went out like a firefly, and that was all."
robertfrost,"So there were witnesses that Paul was married,"
robertfrost,And not to anyone to be ashamed of.
robertfrost,Everyone had been wrong in judging Paul.
robertfrost,Murphy told me Paul put on all those airs
robertfrost,About his wife to keep her to himself.
robertfrost,Paul was what’s called a terrible possessor.
robertfrost,Owning a wife with him meant owning her.
robertfrost,She wasn’t anybody else’s business.
robertfrost,"Either to praise her, or so much as name her,"
robertfrost,And he’d thank people not to think of her.
robertfrost,Murphy’s idea was that a man like Paul
robertfrost,Wouldn’t be spoken to about a wife
robertfrost,In any way the world knew how to speak.

robertfrost,WILD GRAPES
robertfrost,What tree may not the fig be gathered from?
robertfrost,The grape may not be gathered from the birch?
robertfrost,"It’s all you know the grape, or know the birch."
robertfrost,As a girl gathered from the birch myself
robertfrost,"Equally with my weight in grapes, one autumn,"
robertfrost,I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of.
robertfrost,"I was bom, I suppose, like anyone."
robertfrost,And grew to be a little boyish girl
robertfrost,My brother could not always leave at home.
robertfrost,But that beginning was wiped out in fear
robertfrost,The day I swung suspended with the grapes.
robertfrost,And was come after like Eurydice
robertfrost,And brought down safely from the upper regions;
robertfrost,And the life I live now’s an extra life
robertfrost,I can waste as I please on whom I please.
robertfrost,So if you see me celebrate two birthdays.
robertfrost,And give myself out as two different ages.
robertfrost,One of them five years younger than I look—
robertfrost,One day my brother led me to a glade
robertfrost,Where a white birch he knew of stood alone.
robertfrost,"Wearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves,"
robertfrost,"And heavy on her heavy hair behind,"
robertfrost,"Against her neck, an ornament of grapes."
robertfrost,"Grapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last yea r."
robertfrost,"One bunch of them, and there began to be"
robertfrost,Bunches all round me growing in white birdies.
robertfrost,The way they grew round Leif the Lucky’s German;
robertfrost,"Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though."
robertfrost,"As the moon used to seem when I was younger,"
robertfrost,And only freely to be had for climbing.
robertfrost,[ 240 ]
robertfrost,My brother did the climbing; and at first
robertfrost,Threw me down grapes to miss and scatter
robertfrost,And have to hunt fcr in sweet fern and hardhack;
robertfrost,"Which gave him some time to himself to eat,"
robertfrost,"But not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed."
robertfrost,"So then, to make me wholly self-supporting."
robertfrost,He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth
robertfrost,And put it in my hands to pick my own grapes.
robertfrost,"'Here, take a tree-top. I’ll get down another."
robertfrost,Hold on with all your might when I let go.’
robertfrost,I said I had the tree. It wasn’t true.
robertfrost,The opposite was true. The tree had me.
robertfrost,The minute it was left with me alone
robertfrost,It caught me up as if I were the fish
robertfrost,And it the fishpole. So I was translated
robertfrost,To loud cries from my brother of 'Let go!
robertfrost,"Don’t you know anything, you girl? Let go!’"
robertfrost,"But I, with something of the baby grip"
robertfrost,Acquired ancestrally in just such trees
robertfrost,When wilder mothers than our wildest now
robertfrost,Hung babies out on branches by the hands
robertfrost,"To dry or wash or tan, I don’t know which,"
robertfrost,(You’ll have to ask an evolutionist)—
robertfrost,I held on uncomplainingly for life.
robertfrost,My brother tried to make me laugh to help me.
robertfrost,“What are you doing up there in those grapes?
robertfrost,Don’t be afraid. A few of them won’t hurt you.
robertfrost,"I mean, they won’t pick you if you don’t them.’"
robertfrost,Much danger of my picking anything!
robertfrost,By that time I was pretty well reduced
robertfrost,To a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang.
robertfrost,"‘Now you know how it feels,’ my brother said,"
robertfrost,"To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them,"
robertfrost,[ 241 ]
robertfrost,That when it thinks it has escaped the fox
robertfrost,By growing where it shouldn’t— on a birch.
robertfrost,Where a fox wouldn’t think to look for it—
robertfrost,"And if he looked and found it, couldn’t reach it—"
robertfrost,Just then come you and I to gather it.
robertfrost,Only you have the advantage of the grapes
robertfrost,In one way: you have one more stem to cling by.
robertfrost,And promise more resistance to the picker.’
robertfrost,"One by one I lost off my hat and shoes,"
robertfrost,"And still I clung. I let my head fall back,"
robertfrost,"And shut my eyes against the sun, my ears"
robertfrost,"Against my brother’s nonsense; ‘Drop,’ he said,"
robertfrost,‘I’ll catch you in my arms. It isn’t far.’
robertfrost,(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.)
robertfrost,‘Drop or I’ll shake the tree and shake you down.’
robertfrost,"Grim silence on my part as I sank lower,"
robertfrost,My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo
robertfrost,strings.
robertfrost,"Why, if she isn’t serious about it!"
robertfrost,Hold tight awhile till I think what to do.
robertfrost,I’ll bend the tree down and let you down by it.’
robertfrost,I don’t know much about the letting down;
robertfrost,But once I felt ground with my stocking feet
robertfrost,"And the world came revolving back to me,"
robertfrost,I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers.
robertfrost,Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off.
robertfrost,My brother said: ‘Don’t you weigh anything?
robertfrost,"Try to weigh something next time, so you won’t"
robertfrost,Be run off with by birch trees into space.’
robertfrost,It wasn’t my not weighing anything
robertfrost,So much as my not knowing any thin g—
robertfrost,[ 242 ]
robertfrost,My brother had been nearer right before.
robertfrost,I had not taken the first step in knowledge;
robertfrost,"I had not learned to let go with the hands,"
robertfrost,"As still I have not learned to with the heart,"
robertfrost,"And have no wish to with the heart— nor need,"
robertfrost,That I can see. The mind— is not the heart.
robertfrost,"I may yet live, as I know others live,"
robertfrost,To wish in vain to let go with the mind—
robertfrost,"Of cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells me"
robertfrost,That I need learn to let go with the heart.

robertfrost,PLACE FOR A THIRD
robertfrost,Nothing to say to all those marriages!
robertfrost,She had made three herself to three of his.
robertfrost,"The score was even for them, three to three."
robertfrost,But come to die she found she cared so much:
robertfrost,She thought of children in a burial row;
robertfrost,Three children in a burial row were sad.
robertfrost,One man’s three women in a burial row
robertfrost,Somehow made her impatient with the man.
robertfrost,"And so she said to Laban, ‘You have done"
robertfrost,A good deal right; don’t do the last thing wrong.
robertfrost,Don’t make me he with those two other women.’
robertfrost,"Laban said. No, he would not make her lie"
robertfrost,With anyone but that she had a mind to.
robertfrost,"If that was how she felt, of course, he said."
robertfrost,She went her way. But Laban having caught
robertfrost,"This glimpse of lingering person in Eliza,"
robertfrost,And anxious to make all he could of it
robertfrost,With something he remembered in himself.
robertfrost,Tried to think how he could exceed his promise.
robertfrost,"And give good measure to the dead, though thankless."
robertfrost,"If that was how she felt, he kept repeating."
robertfrost,His first thought under pressure was a grave
robertfrost,In a new boughten grave plot by herself.
robertfrost,Under he didn’t care how great a stone:
robertfrost,He’d sell a yoke of steers to pay for it.
robertfrost,"And weren’t there special cemetery flowers,"
robertfrost,"That, once grief sets to growing, grief may rest;"
robertfrost,"The flowers will go on with grief awhile,"
robertfrost,And no one seem neglecting or neglected?
robertfrost,A prudent grief will not despise such aids.
robertfrost,[ 244 ]
robertfrost,He thought of evergreen and everlasting.
robertfrost,And then he had a thought worth many of these.
robertfrost,Somewhere must be the grave of the young boy
robertfrost,"Who married her for playmate more than helpmate,"
robertfrost,And sometimes laughed at what it was between them.
robertfrost,How would she like to sleep her last with him?
robertfrost,Where was his grave? Did Laban know his name?
robertfrost,He found the grave a town or two away.
robertfrost,"The headstone cut with John, Beloved Husband,"
robertfrost,"Beside it room reserved, the say a sister’s,"
robertfrost,"A never-married sister’s of that husband,"
robertfrost,Whether Eliza would be welcome there.
robertfrost,The dead was bound to silence: ask the sister.
robertfrost,"So Laban saw the sister, and, saying nothing"
robertfrost,Of where Eliza wanted not to lie.
robertfrost,And who had thought to lay her with her first love.
robertfrost,Begged simply for the grave. The sister’s face
robertfrost,Fell all in wrinkles of responsibility.
robertfrost,She wanted to do right. She’d have to think.
robertfrost,"Laban was old and poor, yet seemed to care;"
robertfrost,"And she was old and poor— but she cared, too."
robertfrost,"They sat. She cast one dull, old look at him,"
robertfrost,Then turned him out to go on other errands
robertfrost,She said he might attend to in the village.
robertfrost,While she made up her mind how much she cared—
robertfrost,"And how much Laban cared— and why he cared,"
robertfrost,(She made shrewd eyes to see where he came in.)
robertfrost,"She’d looked Eliza up her second time,"
robertfrost,A widow at her second husband’s grave.
robertfrost,And offered her a home to rest awhile
robertfrost,Before she went the poor man’s widow’s way.
robertfrost,Housekeeping for the next man out of wedlock.
robertfrost,[ 245 ]
robertfrost,She and Eliza had been friends through all.
robertfrost,Who was she to judge marriage in a world
robertfrost,Whose Bible’s so confused in marriage counsel?
robertfrost,The sister had not come across this Laban;
robertfrost,A decent product of life’s ironing-out;
robertfrost,She must not keep him waiting. Time would press
robertfrost,Between the death day and the funeral day.
robertfrost,So when she saw him coming in the street
robertfrost,She hurried her decision to be ready
robertfrost,To meet him with his answer at the door.
robertfrost,Laban had known about what it would be
robertfrost,"From the way she had set her poor old mouth,"
robertfrost,"To do, as she had put it, what was right."
robertfrost,She gave it through the screen door closed between them:
robertfrost,"‘No, not with John. There wouldn’t be no sense."
robertfrost,Eliza’s had too many other men.’
robertfrost,Laban was forced to fall back on his plan
robertfrost,To buy Eliza a plot to he alone in :
robertfrost,Which gives him for himself a choice of lots
robertfrost,When his time comes to die and settle down.

robertfrost,i
robertfrost,THE WITCH OF COOS
robertfrost,I stayed the night for shelter at a farm
robertfrost,"Behind the mountain, with a mother and son,"
robertfrost,Two old-believers. They did all the talking.
robertfrost,mother. Folks think a witch who has familiar spirits
robertfrost,"She could call up to pass a winter evening,"
robertfrost,"But won’t, should be burned at the stake or something."
robertfrost,"Summoning spirits isn’t ‘Button, button,"
robertfrost,"Who’s got the button,’ I would have them know."
robertfrost,son. Mother can make a common table rear
robertfrost,And kick with two legs like an army mule.
robertfrost,"mother. And when I’ve done it, what good have I doner"
robertfrost,"Rather than tip a table for you, let me"
robertfrost,Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me.
robertfrost,"He said the dead had souls, but when I asked him"
robertfrost,How could that be— I thought the dead were souls.
robertfrost,He broke my trance. Don’t that make you suspicious
robertfrost,That there’s something the dead are keeping back?
robertfrost,"Yes, there’s something the dead are keeping back."
robertfrost,son. You wouldn’t want to tell him what we have
robertfrost,"Up attic, mother?"
robertfrost,mother. Bones— a skeleton.
robertfrost,son. But the headboard of mother’s bed is pushed
robertfrost,Against the attic door: the door is nailed.
robertfrost,[ 247 ]
robertfrost,It’s harmless. Mother hears it in the night
robertfrost,Halting perplexed behind the barrier
robertfrost,Of door and headboard. Where it wants to get
robertfrost,Is back into the cellar where it came from.
robertfrost,"mother. We’ll never let them, will we, son! We’ll never!"
robertfrost,son. It left the cellar forty years ago
robertfrost,And carried itself like a pile of dishes
robertfrost,Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen.
robertfrost,Another from the kitchen to the bedroom.
robertfrost,"Another from the bedroom to the attic,"
robertfrost,"Right past both father and mother, and neither stopped it."
robertfrost,Father had gone upstairs; mother was downstairs.
robertfrost,I was a baby: I don’t know where I was.
robertfrost,mother. The only fault my husband found with me—
robertfrost,I went to sleep before I went to bed.
robertfrost,Especially in winter when the bed
robertfrost,Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow.
robertfrost,The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs
robertfrost,"Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me,"
robertfrost,But left an open door to cool the room off
robertfrost,So as to sort of turn me out of it.
robertfrost,I was just coming to myself enough
robertfrost,"To wonder where the cold was coming from,"
robertfrost,When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom
robertfrost,And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar
robertfrost,The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on
robertfrost,When there was water in the cellar in spring
robertfrost,Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then someone
robertfrost,"Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step."
robertfrost,"The way a man with one leg and a crutch,"
robertfrost,[ 248 ]
robertfrost,"Or a little child, comes up. It wasn’t Toffile:"
robertfrost,It wasn’t anyone who could be there.
robertfrost,The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked
robertfrost,And swollen tight and buried under snow.
robertfrost,The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust
robertfrost,And swollen tight and buried under snow.
robertfrost,It was the bones. I knew them— and good reason.
robertfrost,My first impulse was to get to the knob
robertfrost,And hold the door. But the bones didn’t try
robertfrost,The door; they halted helpless on the landing.
robertfrost,Waiting for things to happen in their favor.
robertfrost,The faintest restless rustling ran all through them.
robertfrost,I never could have done the thing I did
robertfrost,If the wish hadn’t been too strong in me
robertfrost,To see how they were mounted for this walk.
robertfrost,I had a vision of them put together
robertfrost,"Not like a man, but like a chandelier."
robertfrost,So suddenly I flung the door wide on him.
robertfrost,A moment he stood balancing with emotion.
robertfrost,And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire
robertfrost,Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth.
robertfrost,Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.)
robertfrost,"Then he came at me with one hand outstretched,"
robertfrost,The way he did in life once; but this time
robertfrost,"I struck the hand off brittle on the floor,"
robertfrost,And fell back from him on the floor myself.
robertfrost,The finger-pieces slid in all directions.
robertfrost,(Where did I see one of those pieces lately?
robertfrost,Hand me my button-box— it must be there.)
robertfrost,"I sat up on the floor and shouted, “Toffile,"
robertfrost,It’s coming up to you.’ It had its choice
robertfrost,Of the door to the cellar or the hall.
robertfrost,"It took the hall door for the novelty,"
robertfrost,[ 249 ]
robertfrost,"And set off briskly for so slow a thing,"
robertfrost,"Still going every which way in the joints, though."
robertfrost,"So that it looked like lightning or a scribble,"
robertfrost,From the slap I had just now given its hand.
robertfrost,I listened till it almost climbed the stairs
robertfrost,"From the hall to the only finished bedroom,"
robertfrost,Before I got up to do anything;
robertfrost,"Then ran and shouted, ‘Shut the bedroom door,"
robertfrost,"Toffile, for my sake!’ ‘Company?’ he said,"
robertfrost,‘Don’t make me get up; I’m too warm in bed.’
robertfrost,So lying forward weakly on the handrail
robertfrost,"I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light"
robertfrost,(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own
robertfrost,"I could see nothing. ‘Toffile, I don’t see it."
robertfrost,It’s with us in the room though. It’s the bones.’
robertfrost,‘What bones?’ ‘The cellar bones— out of the grave/
robertfrost,That made him throw his bare legs out of bed
robertfrost,And sit up by me and take hold of me.
robertfrost,I wanted to put out the light and see
robertfrost,"If I could see it, or else mow the room."
robertfrost,With our arms at the level of our knees.
robertfrost,And bring the chalk-pile down. ‘I’ll tell you what—
robertfrost,It’s looking for another door to try.
robertfrost,The uncommonly deep snow has made him think
robertfrost,"Of his old song, The Wild Colonial Boy,"
robertfrost,He always used to sing along the tote road.
robertfrost,He’s after an open door to get outdoors.
robertfrost,Let’s trap him with an open door up attic.’
robertfrost,"Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough,"
robertfrost,Almost the moment he was given an opening.
robertfrost,The steps began to climb the attic stairs.
robertfrost,I heard them. Toffile didn’t seem to hear them.
robertfrost,‘Quick!’ I slammed to the door and held the knob.
robertfrost,[ 250 ]
robertfrost,"Toffile, get nails.’ I made him nail the door shut"
robertfrost,And push the headboard of the bed against it.
robertfrost,Then we asked was there anything
robertfrost,Up attic that we’d ever want again.
robertfrost,The attic was less to us than the cellar.
robertfrost,"If the bones liked the attic, let them have it."
robertfrost,Let them stay in the attic. When they sometimes
robertfrost,Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed
robertfrost,"Behind the door and headboard of the bed,"
robertfrost,"Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,"
robertfrost,"With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,"
robertfrost,That’s what I sit up in the dark to say—
robertfrost,To no one any more since Toffile died.
robertfrost,Let them stay in the attic since they went there.
robertfrost,I promised Toffile to be cruel to them
robertfrost,For helping them be cruel once to him.
robertfrost,son. We think they had a grave down in the cellar.
robertfrost,mother. We know they had a grave down in the cellar.
robertfrost,son. We never could find out whose bones they were.
robertfrost,"mother. Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for once."
robertfrost,They were a man’s his father killed for me.
robertfrost,I mean a man he killed instead of me.
robertfrost,The least I could do was to help dig their grave.
robertfrost,We were about it one night in the cellar.
robertfrost,Son knows the story: but ’twas not for him
robertfrost,"To tell the truth, suppose the time had come."
robertfrost,Son looks surprised to see me end a lie
robertfrost,We’d kept all these years between ourselves
robertfrost,So as to have it ready for outsiders.
robertfrost,[ 251 ]
robertfrost,But tonight I don’t care enough to lie—
robertfrost,I don’t remember why I ever cared.
robertfrost,"Toffile, if he were here, I don’t believe"
robertfrost,Could tell you why he ever cared himself. . . .
robertfrost,She hadn’t found the finger-bone she wanted
robertfrost,Am ong the buttons poured out in her lap.
robertfrost,I verified the name next morning: Toffile.
robertfrost,The rural letter box said Toffile Lajway.

robertfrost,THE PAUPER WITCH OF GRAFTON
robertfrost,Now that they’ve got it settled whose I be.
robertfrost,I’m going to tell them something they won’t like:
robertfrost,"They’ve got it settled wrong, and I can prove it."
robertfrost,Flattered I must be to have two towns fighting
robertfrost,To make a present of me to each other.
robertfrost,"They don’t dispose me, either one of them,"
robertfrost,To spare them any trouble. Double trouble’s
robertfrost,Always the witch’s motto anyway.
robertfrost,I’ll double theirs for both of them— you watch me.
robertfrost,"They’ll find they’ve got the whole thing to do over,"
robertfrost,"That is, if facts is what they want to go by."
robertfrost,They set a lot (now don’t they?) by a record
robertfrost,Of Arthur Amy’s having once been up
robertfrost,For Hog Reeve in March Meeting here in Warren.
robertfrost,I could have told them any time this twelvemonth
robertfrost,The Arthur Amy I was married to
robertfrost,Couldn’t have been the one they say was up
robertfrost,In Warren at March Meeting for the reason
robertfrost,He wa n’t but fifteen at the time they say.
robertfrost,[ 252 ]
robertfrost,The Arthur Amy I was married to
robertfrost,"Voted the only times he ever voted,"
robertfrost,"Which wasn’t many, in the town of Wentworth."
robertfrost,One of the times was when ’twas in the warrant
robertfrost,To see if the town wanted to take over
robertfrost,The tote road to our clearing where we lived.
robertfrost,I’ll tell you who’d remember— Heman Lapish.
robertfrost,Their Arthur Amy was the father of mine.
robertfrost,So now they’ve dragged it through the law courts once
robertfrost,I guess they’d better drag it through again.
robertfrost,Wentworth and Warren’s both good towns to live in.
robertfrost,Only I happen to prefer to live
robertfrost,"In Wentworth from now on; and when all’s said,"
robertfrost,"Right’s right, and the temptation to do right"
robertfrost,When I can hurt someone by doing it
robertfrost,"Has always been too much for me, it has."
robertfrost,I know of some folks that’d be set up
robertfrost,At having in their town a noted witch:
robertfrost,But most would have to think of the expense
robertfrost,That even I would be. They ought to know
robertfrost,That as a witch I’d often milk a bat
robertfrost,And that’d be enough to last for days.
robertfrost,"It’d make my position stronger, think,"
robertfrost,If I was to consent to give some sign
robertfrost,To make it surer that I was a witch?
robertfrost,"It wa’n’t no sign, I s’pose, when Mallice Huse"
robertfrost,Said that I took him out in his old age
robertfrost,And rode all over everything on him
robertfrost,Until I’d had him worn to skin and bones.
robertfrost,And if I’d left him hitched unblanketed
robertfrost,"In front of one Town Hall, I’d left him hitched"
robertfrost,In front of every one in Grafton County.
robertfrost,"Some cried shame on me not to blanket him,"
robertfrost,[ 253 ]
robertfrost,The poor old man. It would have been all right
robertfrost,If someone hadn’t said to gnaw the posts
robertfrost,"He stood beside and leave his trade mark on them,"
robertfrost,So they could recognize them. Not a post
robertfrost,That they could hear tell of was scarified.
robertfrost,They made him keep on gnawing till he whined.
robertfrost,Then that same smarty someone said to look—
robertfrost,He’d bet Huse was a cribber and had gnawed
robertfrost,The crib he slept in— and as sure’s you’re bom
robertfrost,"They found he’d gnawed the four posts of his bed,"
robertfrost,All four of them to splinters. What did that prove?
robertfrost,Not that he hadn’t gnawed the hitching posts
robertfrost,He said he had besides. Because a horse
robertfrost,Gnaws in the stable ain’t no proof to me
robertfrost,He don’t gnaw trees and posts and fences too.
robertfrost,But everybody took it for a proof.
robertfrost,I was a strapping girl of twenty then.
robertfrost,The smarty someone who spoiled everything
robertfrost,Was Arthur Amy. You know who he was.
robertfrost,That was the way he started courting me.
robertfrost,"He never said much after we were married,"
robertfrost,But I mistrusted he was none too proud
robertfrost,Of having interfered in the Huse business.
robertfrost,I guess he found he got more out of me
robertfrost,By having me a witch. Or something happened
robertfrost,To turn him round. He got to saying things
robertfrost,"To undo what he’d done and make it right,"
robertfrost,"Like, 'No, she ain’t come back from kiting yet."
robertfrost,Last night was one of her nights out. She’s kiting.
robertfrost,She thinks when the wind makes a night of it
robertfrost,She might as well herself.’ But he liked best
robertfrost,To let on he was plagued to death with me:
robertfrost,If anyone had seen me coming home
robertfrost,[ 254 ]
robertfrost,"Over the ridgepole, ’stride of a broomstick."
robertfrost,As often as he had in the tail of the night.
robertfrost,He guessed they’d know what he had to put up with.
robertfrost,"Well, I showed Arthur Amy signs enough"
robertfrost,Off from the house as far as we could keep
robertfrost,And from barn smells you can’t wash out of plowed ground
robertfrost,With all the rain and snow of seven years;
robertfrost,And I don’t mean just skulls of Rogers’ Rangers
robertfrost,"On Moosilauke, but woman signs to man,"
robertfrost,Only bewitched so I would last him longer.
robertfrost,"Up where the trees grow short, the mosses tall,"
robertfrost,I made him gather me wet snow berries
robertfrost,On slippery rocks beside a waterfall.
robertfrost,I made him do it for me in the dark.
robertfrost,And he liked everything I made him do.
robertfrost,I hope if he is where he sees me now
robertfrost,He’s so far off he can’t see what I’ve come to.
robertfrost,You can come down from everything to nothing.
robertfrost,"All is, if I’d a-known when I was young"
robertfrost,"And full of it, that this would be the end."
robertfrost,It doesn’t seem as if I’d had the courage
robertfrost,To make so free and kick up in folks’ faces.
robertfrost,"I might have, but it doesn’t seem as if."
robertfrost,[ 255 ]
robertfrost,AN EMPTY THREAT
robertfrost,I stay;
robertfrost,But it isn’t as if
robertfrost,There wasn’t always Hudson’s Bay
robertfrost,"And the fur trade,"
robertfrost,A small skiff
robertfrost,And a paddle blade.
robertfrost,I can just see my tent pegged.
robertfrost,"And me on the floor,"
robertfrost,"Crosslegged,"
robertfrost,And a trapper looking in at the door
robertfrost,With furs to sell.
robertfrost,"His name’s Joe,"
robertfrost,"Alias John,"
robertfrost,And between what he doesn’t know
robertfrost,And won’t tell
robertfrost,"About where Henry Hudson’s gone,"
robertfrost,I can’t say he’s much help;
robertfrost,But we get on.
robertfrost,The seal yelp
robertfrost,On an ice cake.
robertfrost,It’s not men by some mistake?
robertfrost,"No,"
robertfrost,There’s not a soul
robertfrost,For a wind-break
robertfrost,Between me and the North Pole—
robertfrost,"Except always John-Joe,"
robertfrost,"My French Indian Esquimaux,"
robertfrost,[ 256 ]
robertfrost,"And he’s off setting traps,"
robertfrost,In one himself perhaps.
robertfrost,Give a head shake
robertfrost,Over so much bay
robertfrost,Thrown away
robertfrost,In snow and mist
robertfrost,"That doesn’t exist,"
robertfrost,"I was going to say,"
robertfrost,"For God, man or beast’s sake,"
robertfrost,Yet does perhaps for all three.
robertfrost,Don’t ask Joe
robertfrost,What it is to him.
robertfrost,It’s sometimes dim
robertfrost,What it is to me.
robertfrost,Unless it be
robertfrost,It’s die old captain’s dark fate
robertfrost,Who failed to find or force a strait
robertfrost,In its two-thousand-mile coast;
robertfrost,"And his crew left him where he failed,"
robertfrost,And nothing came of all he sailed.
robertfrost,"It’s to say, ‘You and I’"
robertfrost,"To such a ghost,"
robertfrost,“You and I
robertfrost,Off here

robertfrost,That need endless talk talk
robertfrost,To make them out.’

robertfrost,"A FOUNTAIN, A BOTTLE, A DONKEY’S EARS"
robertfrost,AND SOME BOOKS
robertfrost,Old Davis owned a solid mica mountain
robertfrost,In Dalton that would some day make his fortune.
robertfrost,There’d been some Boston people out to see it:
robertfrost,And experts said that deep down in the mountain
robertfrost,The mica sheets were big as plate glass windows.
robertfrost,He’d like to take me there and show it to me.
robertfrost,Til tell you what you show me. You remember
robertfrost,"You said you knew the place where once, on Kinsman,"
robertfrost,The early Mormons made a settlement
robertfrost,And built a stone baptismal font outdoors—
robertfrost,"But Smith, or someone, called them off the mountain"
robertfrost,To go West to a worse fight with the desert.
robertfrost,You said you’d seen the stone baptismal font.
robertfrost,"Well, take me there.’"
robertfrost,‘Some day I will.’
robertfrost,‘Today.’
robertfrost,"Huh, that old bathtub, what is that to see?"
robertfrost,Let’s talk about it.’
robertfrost,‘Let’s go see the place.’
robertfrost,‘To shut you up I’ll tell you what I’ll do:
robertfrost,I’ll find that fountain if it takes all summer.
robertfrost,"And both of our united strengths, to do it.’"
robertfrost,"‘You’ve lost it, then?’"
robertfrost,[ 258 ]
robertfrost,‘Not so but I can find it.
robertfrost,No doubt it’s grown up some to woods around it.
robertfrost,The mountain may have shifted since I saw it
robertfrost,In eighty-five.’
robertfrost,‘As long ago as that?’
robertfrost,"‘If I remember rightly, it had sprung"
robertfrost,A leak and emptied then. And forty years
robertfrost,Can do a good deal to bad masonry.
robertfrost,You won’t see any Mormon swimming in it.
robertfrost,"But you have said it, and we’re off to find it."
robertfrost,Old as I am. I’m going to let myself
robertfrost,Be dragged by you all over everywhere—’
robertfrost,‘I thought you were a guide.’
robertfrost,"‘I am a guide,"
robertfrost,And that’s why I can’t decently refuse you.’
robertfrost,We made a day of it out of the world.
robertfrost,Ascending to descend to reascend.
robertfrost,The old man seriously took his bearings.
robertfrost,And spoke his doubts in every open place.
robertfrost,We came out on a look-off where we faced
robertfrost,"A cliff, and on the cliff a bottle painted,"
robertfrost,"Or stained by vegetation from above,"
robertfrost,A likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist.
robertfrost,"‘Well, if I haven’t brought you to the fountain,"
robertfrost,At least I’ve brought you to the famous Bottle.’
robertfrost,T won’t accept the substitute. It’s empty.’
robertfrost,[ 259 ]
robertfrost,‘So’s everything.’
robertfrost,1 want my fountain.’
robertfrost,1 guess you’d find the fountain just as empty.
robertfrost,And anyway this tells me where I am.’
robertfrost,‘Hadn’t you long suspected where you were?’
robertfrost,“You mean miles from that Mormon settlement?
robertfrost,"Look here, you treat your guide with due respect"
robertfrost,If you don’t want to spend the night outdoors.
robertfrost,I vow we must be near the place from where

robertfrost,‘Don’t donkey’s ears suggest we shake our own?’
robertfrost,"‘For God’s sake, aren’t you fond of viewing nature?"
robertfrost,You don’t like nature. All you like is books.
robertfrost,What signify a donkey’s ears and bottle.
robertfrost,However natural? Give you your books!
robertfrost,"Well then, right here is where I show you books."
robertfrost,Come straight down off this mountain j'ust as fast
robertfrost,As we can fall and keep a-bouncing on our feet.
robertfrost,It’s hell for knees unless done hell-for-leather.’
robertfrost,"*Be ready,’ I thought, ‘for almost anything.’"
robertfrost,"We struck a road I didn’t recognize,"
robertfrost,But welcomed for the chance to lave my shoes
robertfrost,In dust once more. We followed this a mife
robertfrost,[ 260 ]
robertfrost,"Perhaps, to where it ended at a house"
robertfrost,I didn’t know was there. It was the kind
robertfrost,To bring me to for broad-board paneling.
robertfrost,I never saw so good a house deserted.
robertfrost,‘Excuse me if I ask you in a window
robertfrost,"That happens to be broken,’ Davis said."
robertfrost,‘The outside doors as yet have held against us.
robertfrost,I want to introduce you to the people
robertfrost,Who used to live here. They were Robinsons.
robertfrost,"You must have heard of Clara Robinson,"
robertfrost,The poetess who wrote the book of verses
robertfrost,And had it published. It was all about
robertfrost,The posies on her inner window sill.
robertfrost,"And the birds on her outer window sill,"
robertfrost,"And how she tended both, or had them tended:"
robertfrost,She never tended anything herself.
robertfrost,She was “shut in” for life. She lived her whole
robertfrost,"Life long in bed, and wrote her things in bed."
robertfrost,I’ll show you how she had her sills extended
robertfrost,To entertain the birds and hold the flowers.
robertfrost,Our business first’s up attic with her books.’
robertfrost,We trod uncomfortably on crunching glass
robertfrost,Through a house stripped of everything
robertfrost,"Except, it seemed, the poetess’s poems."
robertfrost,"Books, I should say!— if books are what is needed."
robertfrost,"A whole edition in a packing-case,"
robertfrost,"That, overflowing like a horn of plenty,"
robertfrost,"Or like the poetess’s heart of love,"
robertfrost,Had spilled them near the window toward the light
robertfrost,Where driven rain had wet and swollen them.
robertfrost,Enough to stock a village library—
robertfrost,[ 261 ]
robertfrost,"Unfortunately all of one kind, though."
robertfrost,They had been brought home from some publisher
robertfrost,And taken thus into the family.
robertfrost,Boys and bad hunters had known what to do
robertfrost,With stone and lead to unprotected glass:
robertfrost,Shatter it inward on the unswept floors.
robertfrost,How had the tender verse escaped their outrage?
robertfrost,"By being invisible for what it was,"
robertfrost,Or else by some remoteness that defied them
robertfrost,To find out what to do to hurt a poem.
robertfrost,"Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,"
robertfrost,To send it sailing out the attic window
robertfrost,"Till it caught wind, and, opening out its covers."
robertfrost,Tried to improve on sailing like a tile
robertfrost,"By flying like a bird (silent in flight,"
robertfrost,"But all the burden of its body song),"
robertfrost,"Only to tumble like a stricken bird,"
robertfrost,And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved.
robertfrost,Books were not thrown irreverently about.
robertfrost,They simply lay where someone now and then.
robertfrost,"Having tried one, had dropped it at his feet"
robertfrost,And left it lying where it fell rejected.
robertfrost,Here were all those the poetess’s life
robertfrost,Had been too short to sell or give away.
robertfrost,"‘Take one,’ Old Davis bade me graciously."
robertfrost,*Why not take two or three?’
robertfrost,‘Take all you want.
robertfrost,Good-looking books like that.’ He picked one fresh
robertfrost,"In virgin wrapper from deep in the box,"
robertfrost,And stroked it with a horny-handed kindness.
robertfrost,[ 262 ]
robertfrost,"He read in one and I read m another,"
robertfrost,Both either looking for or finding something.
robertfrost,The attic wasps went missing by like bullets.
robertfrost,I was soon satisfied for the time being.
robertfrost,All the way home I kept remembering
robertfrost,The small book in my pocket. It was there.
robertfrost,"The poetess had sighed, I knew, in heaven"
robertfrost,At having eased her heart of one more copy—
robertfrost,"Legitimately. My demand upon her,"
robertfrost,"Though slight, was a demand. She felt the tug."
robertfrost,In time she would be rid of all her books.

robertfrost,(Though not yet light)
robertfrost,And give up sleep.
robertfrost,The snow fell deep

robertfrost,"One down another,"
robertfrost,And fight in a smother

robertfrost,A note unruffled
robertfrost,Of earthlv weather.
robertfrost,Though strange and muffled
robertfrost,"The tower said, ‘One!’"
robertfrost,And then a steeple.
robertfrost,They spoke to themselves
robertfrost,And such few people

robertfrost,As winds might rouse
robertfrost,From sleeping warm
robertfrost,(But not unhouse).
robertfrost,They left the storm
robertfrost,That struck en masse

robertfrost,Like a beaded fur.
robertfrost,In that grave One
robertfrost,They spoke of the sun
robertfrost,"And moon and stars,"
robertfrost,Saturn and Mars
robertfrost,And Jupiter.
robertfrost,"Still more unfettered,"
robertfrost,They left the named
robertfrost,"And spoke of the lettered,"
robertfrost,The sigmas and taus
robertfrost,Of constellations.
robertfrost,They filled their throats
robertfrost,With the furthest bodies
robertfrost,To which man sends his
robertfrost,"Speculation,"
robertfrost,Beyond which God is;
robertfrost,The cosmic motes
robertfrost,Of yawning lenses.
robertfrost,Their solemn peals
robertfrost,Were not their own:

robertfrost,"To be a nova,"

robertfrost,"Since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet)—"

robertfrost,"Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,"

robertfrost,And snorted at us. And then he had to bolt.
robertfrost,"We heard the miniature thunder where he fled,"
robertfrost,"And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and gray,"
robertfrost,Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.
robertfrost,‘I think the little fellow’s afraid of the snow.
robertfrost,He isn’t winter-broken. It isn’t play
robertfrost,With the little fellow at all. He’s running away.
robertfrost,"I doubt if even his mother could tell him, “Sakes,"
robertfrost,It’s only weather.” He’d think she didn’t know!
robertfrost,Where is his mother? He can’t be out alone.’
robertfrost,And now he comes again with clatter of stone.
robertfrost,And mounts the wall again with whited eyes
robertfrost,And all his tail that isn’t hair up straight.
robertfrost,He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.

robertfrost,"I reached out blindly to save my face,"

robertfrost,The swinging mill bell changed its rate

robertfrost,(He couldn’t hope its heart would break.)

robertfrost,Mans ingenuity was good.
robertfrost,"He saw it plainly where he stood,"

robertfrost,"And if he stood on one of these,"
robertfrost,"’Twould be among the tops of trees,"
robertfrost,"Their upper branches round him wreathing,"

robertfrost,If— if he stood! Enough of ifs!
robertfrost,He knew a path that wanted walking;
robertfrost,"He knew a spring that wanted drinking,"
robertfrost,A thought that wanted further thinking;
robertfrost,A love that wanted re-renewing.
robertfrost,Nor was this just a way of talking
robertfrost,To save him the expense of doing.
robertfrost,"With him it boded action, deed."
robertfrost,The factory was very fine;
robertfrost,He wished it all the modern speed.
robertfrost,"Yet, after all, ’twas not divine."
robertfrost,"That is to say, ’twas not a church."
robertfrost,He never would assume that he’d
robertfrost,Be any institution’s need.

robertfrost,"Good blocks of oak it was I split,"

robertfrost,Fell splinterless as a cloven rock.
robertfrost,The blows that a life of self-control
robertfrost,Spares to strike for the common good
robertfrost,"That day, giving a loose to my soul,"

robertfrost,A ROADSIDE STAND
robertfrost,The little old house was out with a little new shed
robertfrost,"In front at the edge of the road where the traffic sped,"
robertfrost,"A roadside stand that too pathetically plead,"
robertfrost,It would not be fair to say for a dole of bread.
robertfrost,"But for some of the money, the cash, whose flow supports"
robertfrost,The flower of cities from sinking and withering faint.
robertfrost,"The pohshed traffic passed with a mind ahead,"
robertfrost,"Or if ever aside a moment, then out of sorts"
robertfrost,At having the landscape marred with the artless paint
robertfrost,Of signs that with N turned wrong and S turned wrong
robertfrost,"Offered for sale wild berries in wooden quarts,"
robertfrost,"Or crook-necked golden squash with silver warts,"
robertfrost,Or beauty rest in a beautiful mountain scene.
robertfrost,"You have the money, but if you want to be mean,"
robertfrost,"Why keep your money (this crossly), and go along."
robertfrost,The hurt to the scenery wouldn’t be my complaint
robertfrost,So much as the trusting sorrow of what is unsaid:
robertfrost,Here far from the city we make our roadside stand
robertfrost,And ask for some city money to feel in hand
robertfrost,To try if it will not make our being expand.
robertfrost,And give us the life of the moving pictures’ promise
robertfrost,That the party in power is said to be keeping from us.
robertfrost,It is in the news that all these pitiful kin
robertfrost,Are to be bought out and mercifully gathered in
robertfrost,To live in villages next to the theater and store
robertfrost,Where they won’t have to think for themselves any more;
robertfrost,"While greedy good-doers, beneficent beasts of prey."
robertfrost,Swarm over their lives enforcing benefits
robertfrost,"That are calculated to soothe them out of their wits,"
robertfrost,[ 370 ]
robertfrost,"And by teaching them how to sleep the sleep all day,"
robertfrost,Destioy their sleeping at night the ancient way.
robertfrost,Sometimes I feel myself I can hardly bear
robertfrost,"The thought of so much childish longing in vam,"
robertfrost,The sadness that lurks near the open window there.
robertfrost,That waits all day in almost open piayer
robertfrost,"For the squeal of brakes, the sound of a stopping car,"
robertfrost,"Of all the thousand selfish cars that pass,"
robertfrost,Just one to inquire what a farmer’s puces are.
robertfrost,"And one did stop, but only to plow up grass"
robertfrost,"In using the yard to back and turn around,"
robertfrost,"And another to ask the way to where it was bound,"
robertfrost,And another to ask could they sell it a gallon of gas
robertfrost,"They couldn’t (this crossly) : they had none, didn’t it see?"
robertfrost,"No, m country money, the country scale of gain,"
robertfrost,"The requisite lift of spirit has never been found,"
robertfrost,Or so the voice of the country seems to complam.
robertfrost,I can’t help owning the great rehef it would be
robertfrost,To put these people at one stroke out of their pain.
robertfrost,"And then next day as I come back mto the sane,"
robertfrost,I wonder how I should like you to come to me
robertfrost,And offer to put me gently out of my pain.
robertfrost,DEPARTMENTAL
robertfrost,An ant on the tablecloth
robertfrost,Ran into a dormant moth
robertfrost,Of many times his size
robertfrost,He showed not the least surprise.
robertfrost,His business wasn’t with such.
robertfrost,"He gave it scarcely a touch,"
robertfrost,And was off on his duty run.
robertfrost,Yet if he encountered one
robertfrost,Of the hive’s enquiry squad
robertfrost,Whose work is to find out God
robertfrost,And the nature of time and space.
robertfrost,He would put him onto the case.
robertfrost,Ants are a curious race;
robertfrost,One crossmg with hurried tread
robertfrost,The body of one of their dead
robertfrost,Isn’t given a moment’s arrest—
robertfrost,Seems not even impressed.
robertfrost,But he no doubt reports to any
robertfrost,"With whom he crosses antennae,"
robertfrost,And they no doubt report
robertfrost,To the higher up at court.
robertfrost,Then word goes forth in Formic:
robertfrost,"‘Death’s come to Jerry McCormic,"
robertfrost,Our selfless forager Jerry.
robertfrost,Will the special Janizary
robertfrost,Whose office it is to bury
robertfrost,The dead of the commissary

robertfrost,"And heavmg him high in air,"

robertfrost,"Where’s this barn’s house? It never had a house,"
robertfrost,Or joined with sheds in ring-around a dooryard
robertfrost,"The hunter scuffling leaves goes by at dusk,"
robertfrost,The gun reversed that he went out with shouldered.
robertfrost,The harvest moon and then the hunter’s moon
robertfrost,"Well, the moon after that came one at last"
robertfrost,To close this outpost barn and close the season.
robertfrost,"The fur-thing, muff-thing, rocking in and out"
robertfrost,Across the threshold in the twilight fled him.
robertfrost,"He took the props down used for propping open,"
robertfrost,"And set them up again for propping shut,"
robertfrost,The wide-spread double doors two stories high.
robertfrost,The advantage-disadvantage of these doors
robertfrost,Was that tramp taking sanctuary there
robertfrost,Must leave them unlocked to betray his presence.
robertfrost,They could be locked but from the outside only.
robertfrost,There is a fellow on the ocean now
robertfrost,Or down a mine or at the mill (I met him)
robertfrost,Who slept there in a mow of meadow hay
robertfrost,One night (he told me). And the bam he meant
robertfrost,Was the one I meant. Our details agreed.
robertfrost,"We said Well twice to what we had in common,"
robertfrost,The old barn at the bottom of the fogs.
robertfrost,Its only windows were the crevices
robertfrost,All up and down it. So that waking there
robertfrost,Next morning to the light of day was more
robertfrost,Like waking in a cage of silver bars.
robertfrost,Its locks were props— and that reminded him.
robertfrost,Trust him to have his bitter politics
robertfrost,Against his unacquaintances the rich
robertfrost,"Who sleep in houses of their own, though mortgaged."
robertfrost,[ 374 ]
robertfrost,"Conservatives, they don’t know what to save."
robertfrost,Consider what they treasure undei glass.
robertfrost,Yet leave such lovely shafts outdoois to perish.
robertfrost,Would someone only act in time we yet
robertfrost,Might see them on a rack like famous oars.
robertfrost,"Their label Prop-locks, only specimens"
robertfrost,In chestnut now become a precious wood
robertfrost,As relic of a vanished race of trees—
robertfrost,When these go there will be none to replace them.
robertfrost,"Yes, right I was the locks were props outside;"
robertfrost,And it had almost given him troubled dreams
robertfrost,To think that though he could not lock himself in.
robertfrost,The cheapest tramp that came along that way
robertfrost,Could mischievously lock him in to stay.
robertfrost,ON THE HEART’S BEGINNING TO CLOUD
robertfrost,THE MIND
robertfrost,Something I saw or thought I saw
robertfrost,"In the desert at midnight in Utah,"
robertfrost,Looking out of my lower berth
robertfrost,At moonlit sky and moonlit earth.
robertfrost,The sky had here and there a star;
robertfrost,"The earth had a single light afar,"
robertfrost,"A flickering, human pathetic light."
robertfrost,That was maintained against the night.
robertfrost,"It seemed to me, by the people there."
robertfrost,With a God-forsaken brute despair.
robertfrost,It would flutter and fall in half an hour
robertfrost,Like the last petal off a flower.
robertfrost,But my heart was beginning to cloud my mind.
robertfrost,I knew a tale of a better kind.
robertfrost,That far light flickers because of trees.
robertfrost,The people can bum it as long as they please:
robertfrost,"And when their interests in it end,"
robertfrost,They can leave it to someone else to tend.
robertfrost,"Come back that way a summer hence,"
robertfrost,I should find it no more no less intense.
robertfrost,"I pass, but scarcely pass no doubt,"
robertfrost,"When one will say, 'Let us put it out.’"
robertfrost,The other without demur agrees.
robertfrost,"They can keep it burning as long as they please,"
robertfrost,They can put it out whenever they please.
robertfrost,One looks out last from the darkened room
robertfrost,At the shiny desert with spots of gloom
robertfrost,"That might be people and are but cedar,"
robertfrost,"Have no purpose, have no leader,"
robertfrost,"Have never made the first move to assemble,"

robertfrost,"The grade surmounted, we were riding high"
robertfrost,Through level mountains nothing to the eye
robertfrost,"But scrub oak, scrub oak and the lack of earth"
robertfrost,That kept the oaks from getting any girth.
robertfrost,"But as through the monotony we ran,"
robertfrost,We came to where there was a living man.
robertfrost,His great gaunt figure filled his cabin door.
robertfrost,And had he fallen inward on the floor.
robertfrost,He must have measured to the further wall.
robertfrost,But we who passed were not to see him fall.
robertfrost,The miles and miles he lived from anywhere
robertfrost,Were evidently somethmg he could bear.
robertfrost,"He stood unshaken, and if grim and gaunt,"
robertfrost,It was not necessarily from want.
robertfrost,He had the oaks for heating and for light.
robertfrost,"He had a hen, he had a pig in sight."
robertfrost,"He had a well, he had the rain to catch."
robertfrost,He had a ten-by-twenty garden patch.
robertfrost,Nor did he lack for common entertainment.

robertfrost,"He could look at us in our diner eating,"
robertfrost,And if so moved uncurl a hand in greeting.

robertfrost,"Words are no good, to say it was a lens"

robertfrost,A look of puzzled dimness to their eyes
robertfrost,That blinking could not seem to blink away.

robertfrost,And exchanged troubled glances over life.
robertfrost,One put a thoughtful hand up to his nose
robertfrost,As if reminded— or as if perhaps
robertfrost,Within a million years of an idea.
robertfrost,He got his purple little knuckles stung.
robertfrost,The already known had once more been confirmed
robertfrost,By psychological experiment.
robertfrost,And that were all the finding to announce
robertfrost,Had the boy not presumed too close and long.
robertfrost,"There was a sudden flash of arm, a snatch."
robertfrost,"And th i glass was the monkeys’, not the boy’s."
robertfrost,Precipitately they retired back cage
robertfrost,And instituted an investigation
robertfrost,"On their part, though without the needed insight."
robertfrost,They bit the glass and listened for the flavor.
robertfrost,They broke the handle and the binding off it.
robertfrost,"Then none the wiser, frankly gave it up,"
robertfrost,And having hid it in their bedding straw
robertfrost,"Against the day of prisoners’ ennui,"
robertfrost,[ 379 ]
robertfrost,Came dryly forward to the bars again
robertfrost,To answer for themselves: Who said it mattered
robertfrost,What monkeys did or didn’t understand?
robertfrost,They might not understand a burning-glass.
robertfrost,They might not understand the sun itself.

robertfrost,And the rest won’t want to punish me too severely
robertfrost,For finding a thing to do that though not forbid
robertfrost,Yet wasn’t enjoined and wasn’t expected clearly.
robertfrost,To punish me overcruelly wouldn’t be right
robertfrost,For merely giving you once more gentle proof
robertfrost,That the city’s hold on a man is no more tight
robertfrost,Than when its walls rose higher than any roof.
robertfrost,You may taunt me with not bemg able to flee the earth.
robertfrost,"You have me there, but loosely as I would be held."

robertfrost,I would not be taken as ever having rebelled.

robertfrost,THE OUTLANDS
robertfrost,THE VINDICTIVES
robertfrost,You like to hear about gold
robertfrost,A king filled his prison room
robertfrost,As full as the room could hold
robertfrost,To the top of his reach on the wall
robertfrost,With every known shape of the stuff.
robertfrost,’Twas to buy himself off his doom.
robertfrost,But it wasn’t ransom enough.
robertfrost,"His captors accepted it all,"
robertfrost,But didn’t let go of the king.
robertfrost,They made him send out a call
robertfrost,To his subjects to gather them more.
robertfrost,And his subjects wrung all they could wring
robertfrost,Out of temple and palace and store
robertfrost,"But when there seemed no more to bring,"
robertfrost,His captors convicted the king
robertfrost,"Of once having started a war,"
robertfrost,And strangled the wretch with a string.
robertfrost,But really that gold was not half
robertfrost,That a king might have hoped to compel—
robertfrost,"Not a half, not a third, not a tithe."
robertfrost,"The long had scarce ceased to writhe,"
robertfrost,When hate gave a terrible laugh.
robertfrost,Like a manhole opened to Hell.
robertfrost,"If gold pleased the conqueror, well,"
robertfrost,That gold should be the one thing
robertfrost,The conqueror henceforth should lack.
robertfrost,They gave no more thought to the king.
robertfrost,All joined in the game of hide-gold.
robertfrost,They swore all the gold should go back
robertfrost,Deep into the earth whence it came.
robertfrost,[ 413 ]
robertfrost,Their minds ran on cranny and crack.
robertfrost,All joined in the maddening game.
robertfrost,The tale is still boastmgly told
robertfrost,Of many a treasuie by name
robertfrost,That vanished into the black
robertfrost,And put out its light for the foe.
robertfrost,That self-sack and self-overthrow.
robertfrost,That was the splendidest sack
robertfrost,Since the forest Germans sacked Rome
robertfrost,And took the gold candlesticks home.
robertfrost,"One Inca prince on the rack,"
robertfrost,And late in his last hour alive.
robertfrost,Told them in what lake to dive
robertfrost,To seek what they seemed so to want.
robertfrost,They dived and nothmg was found
robertfrost,He told them to dive till they drowned.
robertfrost,The whole fierce conquering pack
robertfrost,Hunted and tortured and raged.
robertfrost,There were suns of story and vaunt
robertfrost,They searched for into Brazil
robertfrost,Their tongues hanging out unassuaged
robertfrost,But the conquered grew meek and still.
robertfrost,They slowly and silently aged.
robertfrost,They kept them secrets and died.
robertfrost,Maliciously satisfied.
robertfrost,One knew of a burial hole

robertfrost,"The bearer of evil tidings,"

robertfrost,So when he came to the parting
robertfrost,Where one road led to the throne
robertfrost,And one went off to the mountains
robertfrost,"And into the wild unknown,"
robertfrost,He took the one to the mountains.
robertfrost,"He ran through the Vale of Cashmere,"
robertfrost,He ran through the rhododendrons
robertfrost,Till he came to the land of Pamir.
robertfrost,And there in a precipice valley
robertfrost,A girl of his age he met
robertfrost,Took him home to her bower.
robertfrost,Or he might be running yet.
robertfrost,She taught him her tribe’s religion:
robertfrost,How ages and ages smee
robertfrost,A princess en route from China
robertfrost,To marry a Persian prince
robertfrost,Had been found with child; and her army
robertfrost,Had come to a troubled halt.
robertfrost,And though a god was the father
robertfrost,And nobody else at fault.
robertfrost,It had seemed discreet to remain there
robertfrost,And neither go on nor back.
robertfrost,So they stayed and declared a village
robertfrost,There in the land of the Yak.
robertfrost,[ 416 ]
robertfrost,And the child that came of the princess
robertfrost,"Estabhshed a royal line,"
robertfrost,And his mandates were given heed to
robertfrost,Because he was bom divme
robertfrost,And that was why there were people
robertfrost,On one Himalayan shelf;
robertfrost,And the bearer of evil tidings
robertfrost,Decided to stay there himself.
robertfrost,At least he had this in common
robertfrost,With the race he chose to adopt:
robertfrost,They had both of them had their reasons
robertfrost,For stopping where they had stopped.
robertfrost,"As for his evil tidings,"

robertfrost,Such as according to belief in Rome
robertfrost,Were seen of old at Memphis on the heights
robertfrost,Before the fragments of a former sun
robertfrost,Could concentrate anew and rise as one.
robertfrost,Light was a paste of pigment in our eyes
robertfrost,And then there was a moon and then a scene
robertfrost,"So watery as to seem submarine,"
robertfrost,"In which we two stood saturated, drownea."
robertfrost,The clover-mingled rowan on the ground
robertfrost,Had taken all the water it could as dew.
robertfrost,And still the air was saturated too.
robertfrost,Its airy pressure turned to water weight.
robertfrost,"Then a small rambow hke a trellis gate,"
robertfrost,"A very small moon-made prismatic bow,"
robertfrost,Stood closely over us through which to go.
robertfrost,And then we were vouchsafed the miracle
robertfrost,That never yet to other two befell
robertfrost,And I alone of us have lived to tell
robertfrost,"A wonder! Bow and rainbow as it bent,"
robertfrost,"Instead of moving with us as we went,"
robertfrost,(To keep the pots of gold from being found)
robertfrost,It lifted from its dewy pediment
robertfrost,Its two mote-swimming many-colored ends.
robertfrost,And gathered them together in a ring.
robertfrost,And we stood in it softly circled round
robertfrost,From all division time or foe can bring
robertfrost,In a relation of elected friends.

robertfrost,You come to me and 111 unfold to you

robertfrost,Thought product and food product are to me

robertfrost,I sent you once a song with the refrain:
robertfrost,Let me be the one
robertfrost,To do what is done—
robertfrost,My share at least lest I be empty-idle.
robertfrost,Keep off each other and keep each other off.
robertfrost,You see the beauty of my proposal is
robertfrost,It needn’t wait on general revolution.
robertfrost,I bid you to a one-man revolution—
robertfrost,The only revolution that is coming.
robertfrost,Were too unseparate out among each other—
robertfrost,With goods to sell and notions to impart.
robertfrost,A youngster comes to me with half a quatrain

robertfrost,The song says. Steal away and stay away.
robertfrost,Don’t join too many gangs. Join few if any.

robertfrost,But not much in between unless a college.
robertfrost,"Is it a bargain, Shepherd Mehboeus?"
robertfrost,"Probably, but you’re far too fast and strong"

robertfrost,The last step taken found your heft
robertfrost,Decidedly upon the left.
robertfrost,One more would throw you on the light.
robertfrost,Another still— you see your plight
robertfrost,"You call this thinking, but it’s walking."
robertfrost,"Not even that, it’s only rocking,"
robertfrost,Or weaving like a stabled horse-
robertfrost,From force to matter and back to force.
robertfrost,"From form to content and back to form,"
robertfrost,"From norm to crazy and hack to norm,"
robertfrost,"From bound to free and back to bound,"
robertfrost,From sound to sense and back to sound
robertfrost,So back and forth. It almost scares
robertfrost,A man the way things come in pairs.
robertfrost,Just now you’re off democracy
robertfrost,"(With a polite regret to be),"
robertfrost,And leaning on dictatorship;
robertfrost,But if you will accept the tip.
robertfrost,"In less than no time, tongue and pen."
robertfrost,You’ll be a democrat again.
robertfrost,A reasoner and good as such.
robertfrost,Don’t let it bother you too much
robertfrost,If it makes you look helpless please
robertfrost,And a temptation to the tease.
robertfrost,"Suppose you’ve no direction in you,"
robertfrost,I don’t see but you must continue
robertfrost,"To use the gift you do possess,"
robertfrost,And sway with reason more or less.
robertfrost,I own I never really warmed
robertfrost,To the reformer or reformed.
robertfrost,[ 431 ]
robertfrost,And yet conversion has its place
robertfrost,Not halfway down the scale of grace.
robertfrost,So if you find you must repent
robertfrost,From side to side in argument.
robertfrost,"At least don’t use your mind too hard,"
robertfrost,But trust my instinct— I’m a bard.

robertfrost,A MISSIVE MISSILE
robertfrost,Someone in ancient Mas d’Azil
robertfrost,Once took a little pebble wheel
robertfrost,And dotted it with red for me.
robertfrost,And sent it to me years and years—
robertfrost,A million years to be precise—
robertfrost,Across the barrier of ice:
robertfrost,Two round dots and a ripple streak.
robertfrost,So vivid as to seem to speak.
robertfrost,But what imperfectly appears
robertfrost,Is whether the two dots were tears.
robertfrost,"Two teardrops, one for either eye,"
robertfrost,And the wave line a shaken sigh.
robertfrost,"But no, the color used is red"
robertfrost,Not tears but drops of blood instead.
robertfrost,The line must be a jagged blade.
robertfrost,The sender must have had to die.
robertfrost,And wanted someone now to know
robertfrost,His death was sacrificial-votive
robertfrost,So almost clear and yet obscure.
robertfrost,If only anyone were sure
robertfrost,A motive then was still a motive.
robertfrost,O you who bring this to my hand.
robertfrost,You are no common messenger
robertfrost,(Your badge of office is a spade).
robertfrost,It grieves me to have had you stand
robertfrost,So long for nothing. No reply—
robertfrost,"There is no answer, I’m afraid."
robertfrost,Across the icy barrier
robertfrost,For my obscure petitioner.
robertfrost,Suppose his ghost is standing by
robertfrost,Importunate to give the hint
robertfrost,[ 435 ]
robertfrost,And be successfully conveyed.
robertfrost,How anyone can fail to see
robertfrost,Where perfectly in form and tint
robertfrost,"The metaphor, the symbol lies!"
robertfrost,Why will I not analogize?
robertfrost,(I do too much in some men’s eyes.)
robertfrost,"Oh, slow uncomprehending me."
robertfrost,Enough to make a spirit moan
robertfrost,Or rustle in a bush or tree.
robertfrost,I have the ocher-written flint.
robertfrost,The two dots and the ripple line.
robertfrost,The meaning of it is unknown.
robertfrost,"Or else I fear entirely mine,"
robertfrost,"All modem, nothing ancient in t."
robertfrost,Unsatisfying to us each.
robertfrost,Far as we aim our signs to reach.
robertfrost,"Far as we often make them reach,"
robertfrost,"Across the soul-from-soul abyss,"
robertfrost,There is an aeon-limit set
robertfrost,Beyond which they are doomed to miss.
robertfrost,Two souls may be too widely met.
robertfrost,That sad-with-distance river beach

robertfrost,It cannot speak as far as this.

robertfrost,I verily believe
robertfrost,My fair impression may
robertfrost,Be all from that one day

robertfrost,"But only grave, contemplative and grave."
robertfrost,"What now is inland shall be ocean isle,"

robertfrost,Yet did not much to shorten stride
robertfrost,I sang of death— but had I known
robertfrost,The many deaths one must have died
robertfrost,Before he came to meet his own!
robertfrost,"Oh, should a child be left unwarned"
robertfrost,That any song in which he mourned
robertfrost,Would be as if he prophesied?
robertfrost,It were unworthy of the tongue
robertfrost,To let the half of life alone
robertfrost,And play the good without the ill
robertfrost,And yet ’twould seem that what is sung
robertfrost,In happy sadness by the young
robertfrost,Fate has no choice but to fulfill.

robertfrost,"That past its prime lost petals in the flood,"
robertfrost,(Who cares but for the future of the bud?)
robertfrost,And all the more the mightier the shower
robertfrost,Would run in under it to get my share.
robertfrost,"Tis not enough on roots and in the mouth,"
robertfrost,But give me water heavy on the head
robertfrost,In all the passion of a broken drouth.
robertfrost,And there is always more than should be said.
robertfrost,As strong is rain without as wine within.
robertfrost,As magical as sunlight on the skin.

robertfrost,When there was rain;
robertfrost,"But I must forth at dusk, my time of day,"

robertfrost,He thought he kept the universe alone;
robertfrost,For all the voice in answer he could wake

robertfrost,From some tree-hidden cliff across the lake
robertfrost,Some morning from the boulder-broken beach
robertfrost,"He would cry out on life, that what it wants"
robertfrost,Is not its own love back in copy speech.
robertfrost,"But counter-love, original response."
robertfrost,And nothing ever came of what he cried
robertfrost,Unless it was the embodiment that crashed
robertfrost,In the cliff’s talus on the other side.
robertfrost,And then in the far distant water splashed
robertfrost,But after a time allowed for it to swim.
robertfrost,Instead of proving human when it neared
robertfrost,"And someone else additional to him,"
robertfrost,"As a great buck it powerfully appeared,"
robertfrost,"Pushing the crumpled water up ahead,"

robertfrost,Could only have had an influence on birds

robertfrost,For a woman and a puzzle.

robertfrost,Caught up like finger tips
robertfrost,The comers of his lips
robertfrost,And cracked his ragged muzzle.
robertfrost,She was standing to the waist
robertfrost,In goldenrod and brake.
robertfrost,Her shining hair displaced.

robertfrost,As if he could not spare
robertfrost,To touch her neck and hair.
robertfrost,‘If this has come to us
robertfrost,And not to me alone—’

robertfrost,To see if he could hear
robertfrost,And would pounce to end it all
robertfrost,Before her mother came.

robertfrost,A hand hung like a paw.
robertfrost,An arm worked like a saw
robertfrost,As if to be persuasive.
robertfrost,An ingratiating laugh
robertfrost,That cut the snout in half.
robertfrost,An eye become evasive.
robertfrost,A girl could only see
robertfrost,That a flower had marred a man.
robertfrost,But what she could not see
robertfrost,Was that the flower might be
robertfrost,Other than base and fetid:
robertfrost,That the flower had done but part.
robertfrost,And what the flower began
robertfrost,Her own too meager heart

robertfrost,She looked and saw the worst.
robertfrost,And the dog or what it was.

robertfrost,The bitter words she spit
robertfrost,Like some tenacious bit
robertfrost,That will not leave the tongue.

robertfrost,To leave the English law behind
robertfrost,And sail for some vague Paphian bourn

robertfrost,Waiting to see if she would mend;
robertfrost,But sailed and left them in the end.
robertfrost,Her lover saw them sail away.
robertfrost,But dared not tell her all one day.
robertfrost,For slowly even her sense of him
robertfrost,And love itself were growing dim.
robertfrost,He no more drew the smile he sought
robertfrost,The story is she died of thought.

robertfrost,He stayed long enough to carve on stone
robertfrost,The name of the lady with his own
robertfrost,To be her only marriage lines.

robertfrost,"The tale of the voyage he had achieved,"

robertfrost,"And just because we owned to a wish for ram,"

robertfrost,If this uncertain age in which we dwell
robertfrost,"Were really as dark as I hear sages tell,"
robertfrost,"And I convinced that they were really sages,"
robertfrost,"I should not curse myself with it to hell,"
robertfrost,"But leaving not the chair I long have sat in,"
robertfrost,I should betake me back ten thousand pages
robertfrost,"To the world’s undebatably dark ages,"
robertfrost,"And getting up my medieval Latin,"
robertfrost,Seek converse common cause and brotherhood
robertfrost,"(By all that’s liberal— I should, I should)"
robertfrost,With poets who could calmly take the fate
robertfrost,"Of being born at once too early and late,"
robertfrost,And for these reasons kept from bemg great.
robertfrost,Yet singing but Dione in the wood
robertfrost,And ver aspergit terrain floribus
robertfrost,They slowly led old Latin verse to rhyme
robertfrost,And to forget the ancient lengths of time.
robertfrost,And so began the modern world for us.
robertfrost,"I’d say, O Master of the Palace School,"
robertfrost,You were not Charles’ nor anybody’s fool:
robertfrost,"Tell me as pedagogue to pedagogue,"
robertfrost,You did not know that smce King Charles did rule
robertfrost,"You had no chance but to be minor, did you?"
robertfrost,Your light was spent perhaps as in a fog
robertfrost,That at once kept you burning low and hid you.
robertfrost,The age may very well have been to blame
robertfrost,For your not having won to Virgil’s fame.
robertfrost,But no one ever heard you make the claim.
robertfrost,You would not think you knew enough to judge
robertfrost,The age when full upon you. That’s my point.

robertfrost,They’ve tried to grasp with too much social fact
robertfrost,"Too large a situation, You and I"
robertfrost,Would be afraid if we should comprehend
robertfrost,And get outside of too much bad statistics
robertfrost,Our muscles never could again contract:
robertfrost,"We never could recover human shape,"
robertfrost,But must live lives out mentally agape.
robertfrost,Or die of philosophical distention.
robertfrost,That’s how we feel— and we’re no special mystics.
robertfrost,We can’t appraise the time in which we act.
robertfrost,"But for the folly of it, let’s pretend"
robertfrost,We know enough to know it for adverse.
robertfrost,One more millennium’s about to end.
robertfrost,"Let’s celebrate the event, my distant friend,"

robertfrost,"There’s always something to be sorry for,"
robertfrost,A sordid peace or an outrageous war.
robertfrost,"Yes, yes, of course. We have the same convention."
robertfrost,The groundwork of all faith is human woe.
robertfrost,It was well worth preliminary mention.

robertfrost,"We both are the belittled human race,"
robertfrost,One as compared with God and one with space.
robertfrost,"I had thought ours the more profound disgrace,"

robertfrost,To their surprise rang once on stone all day
robertfrost,Each tried to be the first at getting in
robertfrost,A superstitious cry for fanners’ luck—
robertfrost,A rivaliy that made them both feel lander.
robertfrost,And so to let Pike seem to have the palm
robertfrost,With grace and not too formal a surrender
robertfrost,"Dick said, Tou’ve been a lesson m woik wisdom"
robertfrost,To work with. Bill. But you won’t have my thanks.
robertfrost,I like to think the sun’s like you m that—
robertfrost,Since you bring up the subject of the sun.
robertfrost,This would be my interpretation of him.
robertfrost,He bestows summer on us and escapes
robertfrost,Before our realizing what we have
robertfrost,To thank him for. He doesn’t want our thanks.
robertfrost,He likes to turn his back on gratitude
robertfrost,And avoid being worshiped as a god
robertfrost,Our worship was a thing he had too much of
robertfrost,In the old days in Persia and Peru.
robertfrost,Shall I go on or have I said enough—
robertfrost,To convey my respect for your position?’
robertfrost,"T guess so,’ Pike said, innocent of Milton."
robertfrost,‘That’s where I reckon Santa Claus comes m—
robertfrost,To be our parents’ pseudonymity

robertfrost,The thanks and let him catch it as a scapegoat.
robertfrost,"And even he, you’ll notice, dodges off"
robertfrost,Up chimney to avoid the worst of it.

robertfrost,A MASQUE OF REASON
robertfrost,A fair oasts in the purest desert .
robertfrost,"A man sits leaning back against a palm ,"
robertfrost,His wife lies by him looking at the sky .
robertfrost,Man You’re not asleep?
robertfrost,"Wife No, I can hear you Why?"
robertfrost,Man I said the incense tree’s on fire again
robertfrost,Wife You mean the Burning Bush?
robertfrost,Man The Christmas Tree.
robertfrost,Wife I shouldn’t be surprised
robertfrost,Man The strangest light!
robertfrost,Wife There’s a strange light on everything today.
robertfrost,Man The myrrh tree gives it. Smell the rosin bum-
robertfrost,ing?
robertfrost,The ornaments the Greek artificers
robertfrost,"Made for the Emperor Alexius,"
robertfrost,"The Star of Bethlehem, the pomegranates,"
robertfrost,"The birds, seem all on fire with Paradise"
robertfrost,"And hark, the gold enameled nightingales"
robertfrost,"Are singing. Yes, and look, the Tree is troubled."
robertfrost,Someone’s caught in the branches.
robertfrost,He can’t get out.
robertfrost,[ 587 ]
robertfrost,Wife
robertfrost,So there is.
robertfrost,Man
robertfrost,He’s loose! He’s out!
robertfrost,Wife It’s God.
robertfrost,I’d know Him by Blake’s pictuie anywhere.
robertfrost,Now what’s He domg?
robertfrost,"Man Pitching throne, I guess,"
robertfrost,Here by our atoll.
robertfrost,Wife Something Byzantine
robertfrost,"(The throne’s a plywood flat, prefabricated,"
robertfrost,That God pulls lightly upright on its hinges
robertfrost,"And stands beside, supporting it in place )"
robertfrost,"Perhaps for an Olympic Tournament,"
robertfrost,Or Court of Love.
robertfrost,Man More likely Royal Court—
robertfrost,"Or Court of Law, and this is Judgment Day."
robertfrost,I trust it is. Here’s where I lay aside
robertfrost,My varying opinion of myself
robertfrost,And come to rest in an official verdict.
robertfrost,"Suffer yourself to be admired, my love,"
robertfrost,As Waller says.
robertfrost,Wife Or not admired. Go over
robertfrost,And speak to Him before the others come.
robertfrost,Tell Him He may remember you. you’re Job.
robertfrost,"God Oh, I remember well: you’re Job, my Patient."
robertfrost,How are you now? 1 trust you’re quite recov-
robertfrost,"ered,"
robertfrost,And feel no ill effects from what I gave you.
robertfrost,[ 588 ]
robertfrost,Job Gave me in truth. I like the frank admission
robertfrost,I am a name for bemg put upon
robertfrost,"But, yes, I’m fine, except foi now and then"
robertfrost,A reminiscent twinge of lheumatism.
robertfrost,The let-up’s heavenly You perhaps will tell us
robertfrost,"If that is all there is to be of Heaven,"
robertfrost,Escape from so great pams of life on earth
robertfrost,It gives a sense of let-up calculated
robertfrost,To last a fellow to Eternity
robertfrost,"God Yes, by and by. But first a larger matter."
robertfrost,I’ve had you on my mmd a thousand years
robertfrost,To thank you someday for the way you helped
robertfrost,me
robertfrost,Estabhsh once for all the principle
robertfrost,There’s no connection man can reason out
robertfrost,Between his just deserts and what he gets.
robertfrost,Virtue may fail and wickedness succeed.
robertfrost,’Twas a great demonstration we put on.
robertfrost,I should have spoken sooner had I found
robertfrost,The word I wanted. You would have supposed
robertfrost,One who in the beginning was the Word
robertfrost,Would be in a position to command it.
robertfrost,I have to wait for words like anyone.
robertfrost,Too long I’ve owed you this apology
robertfrost,For the apparently unmeaning sorrow
robertfrost,You were afflicted with m those old days.
robertfrost,But it was of the essence of the trial
robertfrost,You shouldn’t understand it at the time.
robertfrost,It had to seem unmeaning to have meaning.
robertfrost,And it came out all right. I have no doubt
robertfrost,You realize by now the part you played
robertfrost,[ 589 ]
robertfrost,To stultify the Deuteionomist
robertfrost,And change the tenor of lehgious thought
robertfrost,My thanks are to you for releasing me
robertfrost,From moral bondage to the human i ace.
robertfrost,The only free will there at fust was man’s.
robertfrost,Who could do good or evil as he chose.
robertfrost,I had no choice but I must follow lum
robertfrost,With forfeits and rewards he understood—
robertfrost,Unless I liked to suffer loss of worship.
robertfrost,I had to prosper good and punish evil.
robertfrost,You changed all that. You set me free to reign.
robertfrost,"You are the Emancipator of your God,"
robertfrost,And as such I promote you to a saint.
robertfrost,"Job You hear him, Thyatna: we’re a saint."
robertfrost,Salvation in our case is retroactive
robertfrost,"Were saved, we’re saved, whatever else it"
robertfrost,means.
robertfrost,"Job’s Wife Well, after all these yearsl"
robertfrost,Job This is my wife.
robertfrost,Job’s Wife If You’re the deity I assume You aie—
robertfrost,(I’d know You by Blake’s picture anywhere)—
robertfrost,"God The best. I’m told, I ever have had taken."
robertfrost,Job’s Wife —I have a protest I would lodge with You.
robertfrost,I want to ask You if it stands to reason
robertfrost,That women prophets should be burned as
robertfrost,witches
robertfrost,Whereas men prophets are received with honor.
robertfrost,[ 590 ]
robertfrost,"Job Except m their own country, Thyatira."
robertfrost,God You’re not a witch?
robertfrost,Job’s Wife No.
robertfrost,God Have you ever been one?
robertfrost,Job Sometimes she thinks she has and gets herself
robertfrost,Worked up about it But she really hasn’t—
robertfrost,Not m the sense of havmg to my knowledge
robertfrost,Predicted anything that came to pass.
robertfrost,Job’s Wife The witch of Endor was a friend of mine
robertfrost,God You wouldn’t say she fared so very badly.
robertfrost,I noticed when she called up Samuel
robertfrost,His spirit had to come. Apparently
robertfrost,A witch was stronger than a prophet there.
robertfrost,Job’s Wife But she was burned for witchcraft.
robertfrost,God That is not
robertfrost,Of record in my Note Book.
robertfrost,"Job’s Wife Well, she was."
robertfrost,And I should like to know the reason why.
robertfrost,God There you go asking for the very thing
robertfrost,We’ve just agreed I didn’t have to give.
robertfrost,(The throne collapses. But He picks it up
robertfrost,And this time locks it up and leaves it.)
robertfrost,[ 591 ]
robertfrost,Where has she been the last half hour or so?
robertfrost,She wants to know why there is still injustice.
robertfrost,"I answer flatly. That’s the way it is,"
robertfrost,And bid my will avouch it like Macbeth.
robertfrost,We may as well go back to the beginning
robertfrost,And look for justice m the case of Segub.
robertfrost,"Job Oh, Lord, let’s not go back to anything."
robertfrost,God Because your wife’s past won’t bear looking
robertfrost,into?
robertfrost,In our great moment what did you do. Madam?
robertfrost,What did you try to make your husband say?
robertfrost,"Job’s Wife No, let’s not live things over. I don’t care."
robertfrost,I stood by Job. I may have turned on You.
robertfrost,Job scratched his boils and tried to think what
robertfrost,he
robertfrost,Had done or not done to or for the poor.
robertfrost,The test is always how we treat the poor.
robertfrost,It’s time the poor weie treated by the state
robertfrost,In some way not so penal as the poorhouse.
robertfrost,That’s one thing more to put on Your agenda.
robertfrost,"Job hadn’t done a thing, poor innocent."
robertfrost,"I told him not to scratch, it made it worse."
robertfrost,"If I said once I said a thousand times,"
robertfrost,"Don’t scratch! And when, as rotten as his skin,"
robertfrost,"His tents blew all to pieces, I picked up"
robertfrost,Enough to build him every night a pup tent
robertfrost,Around him so it wouldn’t touch and hurt him.
robertfrost,I did my wifely duty. I should tremble!
robertfrost,All You can seem to do is lose Your temper
robertfrost,When reason-hungry mortals ask for reasons.
robertfrost,[ 592 ]
robertfrost,"Of course, in the abstiact high singular"
robertfrost,"There isn’t any univeisal reason,"
robertfrost,And no one but a man would think there was
robertfrost,You don’t catch women trying to be Plato
robertfrost,Still there must be lots of unsystematic
robertfrost,Stray scraps of palliative reason
robertfrost,It wouldn’t hurt You to vouchsafe the faithful.
robertfrost,You thought it was agreed You needn’t give
robertfrost,them
robertfrost,You thought to suit Yourself. I’ve not agreed
robertfrost,To anything with anyone.
robertfrost,"Job There, there."
robertfrost,You go to sleep God must await events
robertfrost,As well as words
robertfrost,Job’s Wife I’m serious. God’s had
robertfrost,Aeons of time and still it’s mostly women
robertfrost,"Get burned for prophecy, men almost never."
robertfrost,Job God needs time just as much as you or I
robertfrost,To get thmgs done Reformers fail to see that
robertfrost,She’ll go to sleep. Nothing keeps her awake
robertfrost,"But physical activity, I find"
robertfrost,Try to read to her and she drops right off.
robertfrost,God She’s beautiful.
robertfrost,"Job Yes, she was just remarking"
robertfrost,She now felt youngei by a thousand years
robertfrost,Than the day she was born.
robertfrost,[ 593 ]
robertfrost,"God That’s about right,"
robertfrost,I should have said You got your age reversed
robertfrost,When time was found to be a space dimension
robertfrost,"That could, like any space, be turned around"
robertfrost,in?
robertfrost,"Job Yes, both of us. we saw to that at once."
robertfrost,"But, God, I have a question too to raise"
robertfrost,(My wife gets m ahead of me with hers )
robertfrost,I need some help about tins reason pioblem
robertfrost,Before I am too late to be got right
robertfrost,As to what reasons I agree to waive.
robertfrost,I’m apt to string along with Thyatua.
robertfrost,"God knows— 01 rather, You know (God forgive"
robertfrost,me)
robertfrost,I waived the reason for my 01 deal— but—
robertfrost,I have a question even thei e to ask—
robertfrost,"In confidence. Theie’s no one heie but her,"
robertfrost,And she’s a woman- she’s not interested
robertfrost,In general ideas and principles.
robertfrost,"God What are her interests, Job?"
robertfrost,Job Witch-women’s rights
robertfrost,Humor her there or she will be confiimed
robertfrost,In her suspicion You’ie no feminist
robertfrost,"You have it m for women, she believes"
robertfrost,Kipling invokes You as Lord God of Hosts.
robertfrost,She’d like to know how You would take a
robertfrost,prayer
robertfrost,That started off Lord God of Hostesses.
robertfrost,God I’m charmed with her.
robertfrost,[ 594 ]
robertfrost,Job
robertfrost,"Yes, I could see You were"
robertfrost,But to my question I am much unpiessed
robertfrost,With what You say we have established
robertfrost,"Between us, You and I"
robertfrost,God I make you see?
robertfrost,It would be too bad if Columbus-like
robertfrost,You failed to see the worth of your achieve-
robertfrost,ment
robertfrost,Job You call it mine.
robertfrost,God We groped it out together
robertfrost,Any onginality it showed
robertfrost,"I give you credit foi. My forte is truth,"
robertfrost,"Or metaphysics, long the world’s leproach"
robertfrost,"For standing still in one place tiue forever,"
robertfrost,While science goes self-superseding on.
robertfrost,Look at how far we’ve left the current science
robertfrost,"Of Genesis behind The wisdom there though,"
robertfrost,Is just as good as when I uttered it.
robertfrost,"Still, novelty has doubtless an attraction."
robertfrost,Job So it’s important who first thinks of things?
robertfrost,God I’m a great stickler for the author’s name.
robertfrost,By proper names I find I do my thinking.
robertfrost,"Job’s Wife God, who invented earth?"
robertfrost,"Job What, still awake?"
robertfrost,God Any originality it showed
robertfrost,"Was of the Devil. He invented Hell,"
robertfrost,[ 595 ]
robertfrost,False premises that are the original
robertfrost,"Of all originality, the sin"
robertfrost,"That felled the angels, Wolsey should have"
robertfrost,said.
robertfrost,"As for the earth, we groped that out together,"
robertfrost,Much as your husband Job and I together
robertfrost,Found out the discipline man needed most
robertfrost,"Was to learn his submission to unreason,"
robertfrost,"And that for man’s own sake as well as mine,"
robertfrost,So he won’t find it hard to take his orders
robertfrost,From his mfenors in intelligence
robertfrost,In peace and war— especially in war.
robertfrost,Job So he won’t find it hard to take Ins war.
robertfrost,God You have the idea There’s not much I can tell
robertfrost,you
robertfrost,Job All very splendid. I am flattered proud
robertfrost,To have been in on anything with You.
robertfrost,’Twas a great demonstration if You say so.
robertfrost,Though incidentally I sometimes wonder
robertfrost,Why it had had to be at my expense.
robertfrost,God It had to be at somebody’s expense.
robertfrost,Society can never think things out:
robertfrost,"It has to see them acted out by actors,"
robertfrost,Devoted actors at a sacrifice—
robertfrost,The ablest actors I can lay my hands on.
robertfrost,Is that your answer?
robertfrost,"Job No, for I have yet"
robertfrost,To ask my question. We disparage reason.
robertfrost,[ 596 ]
robertfrost,But all the time it’s what were most concerned
robertfrost,with.
robertfrost,There’s will as motor and theie s will as biakes
robertfrost,"Reason is, I suppose, the steeling geai"
robertfrost,The will as brakes can’t stop the will as motor
robertfrost,For very long. We’re plainly made to go
robertfrost,We’re going anyway and may as well
robertfrost,Have some say as to where were headed for.
robertfrost,Just as we will be talking anyway
robertfrost,And may as well throw m a little sense.
robertfrost,Let’s do so now. Because I let You off
robertfrost,"From telling me Your reason, don’t assume"
robertfrost,I thought You had none. Somewhere back
robertfrost,I knew You had one. But this isn’t it
robertfrost,You’re giving me. You say we groped this out
robertfrost,But if You will forgive me the irreverence.
robertfrost,It sounds to me as if You thought it out.
robertfrost,And took Your time to it. It seems to me
robertfrost,"An afterthought, a long long afterthought"
robertfrost,I’d give more for one least beforehand reason
robertfrost,Than all the justifying ex-post-facto
robertfrost,Excuses trumped up by You for theologists
robertfrost,The front of bemg answerable to no one
robertfrost,I’m with You in maintaining to the public.
robertfrost,"But, Lord, we showed them what. The audience"
robertfrost,Has all gone home to bed. The play’s played
robertfrost,out.
robertfrost,"Come, after all these years-to satisfy me."
robertfrost,I’m curious. And I’m a grown-up man:
robertfrost,I’m not a child for You to put me off
robertfrost,"And tantalize me with another 'Oh, because."
robertfrost,You’d be the last to want me to believe
robertfrost,All Your effects were merely lucky blunders.
robertfrost,[ 597 ]
robertfrost,That would be unbelief and atheism.
robertfrost,The artist m me cries out for design.
robertfrost,Such devilish ingenuity of tortuie
robertfrost,"Did seem unlike You, and I tued to think"
robertfrost,The reason might have been some other per-
robertfrost,son’s.
robertfrost,But there is nothing You are not behind.
robertfrost,"I did not ask then, but it seems as if"
robertfrost,Now after all these years You might indulge
robertfrost,me.
robertfrost,Why did You hurt me so? I am 1 educed
robertfrost,To asking flatly for the reason— outright.
robertfrost,God I’d tell you. Job—
robertfrost,"Job All right, don’t tell me then"
robertfrost,If you don’t want to. I don’t want to know
robertfrost,But what is all this secrecy about?
robertfrost,"I fail to see what fun, what satisfaction"
robertfrost,A God can find in laughing at how badly
robertfrost,Men fumble at the possibilities
robertfrost,When left to guess forever for themselves.
robertfrost,The chances are when there’s so much pretense
robertfrost,Of metaphysical profundity
robertfrost,The obscurity’s a fiaud to cover no tiling.
robertfrost,I’ve come to think no so-called hidden value’s
robertfrost,Worth gomg aftei. Get down into thmgs
robertfrost,It will be found there’s no moie given there
robertfrost,"Than on the surface. If there ever was,"
robertfrost,The crypt was long since rifled by the Greeks.
robertfrost,"We don’t know where we are, or who we are."
robertfrost,We dont know one another; don’t know You;
robertfrost,[ 598 ]
robertfrost,"Don’t know what time it is We don’t know,"
robertfrost,don’t we?
robertfrost,Who says we don’t? Who got up these mis-
robertfrost,givings?
robertfrost,"Oh, we know well enough to go ahead with."
robertfrost,I mean we seem to know enough to act on.
robertfrost,It comes down to a doubt about the wisdom
robertfrost,"Of having childien— after having had them,"
robertfrost,So theie is nothing we can do about it
robertfrost,But warn the children they perhaps should
robertfrost,have none.
robertfrost,You could end this by simply coming out
robertfrost,And saying plainly and unequivocally
robertfrost,Whether there’s any part of man immortal.
robertfrost,Yet You don’t speak. Let fools bemuse them-
robertfrost,selves
robertfrost,By being baffled for the sake of being
robertfrost,I’m sick of the whole artificial puzzle
robertfrost,Job’s Wife You won’t get any answers out of God.
robertfrost,"God My kingdom, what an outbreak!"
robertfrost,Job’s Wife Job is right.
robertfrost,"Your kingdom, yes, Your kingdom come on"
robertfrost,earth.
robertfrost,Pray tell me what does that mean. Anything?
robertfrost,Perhaps that earth is going to crack someday
robertfrost,Like a big egg and hatch a heaven out
robertfrost,Of all the dead and buried from their graves.
robertfrost,One simple little statement from the throne
robertfrost,Would put an end to such fantastic nonsense;
robertfrost,"And, too, take care of twenty of the four"
robertfrost,[ 599 ]
robertfrost,And twenty freedoms on the party docket.
robertfrost,Or is it only four? My extra twenty
robertfrost,Are freedoms from the need of asking ques-
robertfrost,tions.
robertfrost,(I hope You know the game called twenty
robertfrost,questions )
robertfrost,"For instance, is there such a thing as Pi ogress?"
robertfrost,Job says there’s no such thing as Earth’s be-
robertfrost,coming
robertfrost,An easier place for man to save his soul in
robertfrost,"Except as a haid place to save Ins soul in,"
robertfrost,A trial ground where he can try himself
robertfrost,"And find out whether he is any good,"
robertfrost,It would be meaningless It might as well
robertfrost,Be Heaven at once and have it over with.
robertfrost,God Two pitching on like this tend to confuse me.
robertfrost,"One at a time, please. I will answer Job first."
robertfrost,I’m going to tell Job why I toitured him
robertfrost,And trust it won’t be adding to the torture.
robertfrost,"I was just showing off to the Devil, Job,"
robertfrost,As is set forth in chapters One and Two.
robertfrost,(Job takes a few steps pacing.) Do you mind?
robertfrost,( God eyes him anxiously )
robertfrost,"Job No. No, I mustn’t."
robertfrost,’Twas human of You. I expected more
robertfrost,Than I could understand and what I get
robertfrost,Is almost less than I can understand.
robertfrost,But I don’t mind. Let’s leave it as it stood.
robertfrost,The point was it was none of my concern.
robertfrost,I stick to that. But talk about confusion I
robertfrost,"How is that for a mix-up, Thyatira?"
robertfrost,[ 600 ]
robertfrost,Yet I suppose what seems to us confusion
robertfrost,"Is not confusion, but the form of forms,"
robertfrost,The serpent’s tail stuck down the serpent’s
robertfrost,"throat,"
robertfrost,Which is the symbol of eternity
robertfrost,"And also of the way all thmgs come round,"
robertfrost,Or of how rays return upon themselves.
robertfrost,To quote the greatest Western poem yet.
robertfrost,Though I hold rays deteriorate to nothing.
robertfrost,"First white, then red, then ultra red, then out,"
robertfrost,"God Job, you must understand my provocation."
robertfrost,The tempter comes to me and I am tempted.
robertfrost,I’d had about enough of his derision
robertfrost,Of what I valued most in human nature.
robertfrost,He thinks he’s smart. He thinks he can con-
robertfrost,vince me
robertfrost,It is no different with my followers
robertfrost,From what it is with his Both serve for pay.
robertfrost,Disinterestedness never did exist
robertfrost,"And if it did, it wouldn’t be a virtue."
robertfrost,Neither would fairness. You have heard the
robertfrost,doctrine.
robertfrost,It’s on the mcrease. He could count on no one-
robertfrost,That was his look out. I could count on you.
robertfrost,I wanted him forced to acknowledge so much
robertfrost,"I gave you over to him, but with safeguards."
robertfrost,I took care of you. And before you died
robertfrost,I trust I made it clear I took your side
robertfrost,Against your comfoiters in their contention
robertfrost,You must be wicked to deserve such pain.
robertfrost,That’s Browning and sheer Chapel Non-con-
robertfrost,formism.
robertfrost,[ 601 ]
robertfrost,"Job God, please, enough for now. I’m m no mood"
robertfrost,For more excuses.
robertfrost,God What I mean to say:
robertfrost,Your comforters were wrong.
robertfrost,"Job Oh, that committee!"
robertfrost,God I saw you had no fondness for committees.
robertfrost,Next time you find yourself pressed on to one
robertfrost,For the revision of the Book of Prayer
robertfrost,Put that in if it isn’t m already:
robertfrost,Dehver us from committees. ’Twill remind me.
robertfrost,I would do anything for you in reason.
robertfrost,"Job Yes, yes."
robertfrost,God You don’t seem satisfied.
robertfrost,Job I am.

robertfrost,You must remember he was m on this.

robertfrost,God Why not light now?
robertfrost,Job We can’t without the Devil.
robertfrost,God The Devil’s never veiy far away.

robertfrost,"He has but to appear. He’ll come for me,"
robertfrost,Precipitated from the desert air.

robertfrost,Then he could enter on the stricken field
robertfrost,As Red Cross Ambulance Commander m Chief
robertfrost,To ease the more extremely wounded out
robertfrost,And mend the others up to go ag ain
robertfrost,"Paul I thought as much. You have it all arranged,"
robertfrost,Only to see it shattered every day.
robertfrost,You should be an authority on Mercy.
robertfrost,That book of yours in the Old Testament
robertfrost,Is the first place in literature I think
robertfrost,Where Mercy is explicitly the subject.
robertfrost,I say you should be proud of having beaten
robertfrost,"The Gospels to it After doing Justice justice,"
robertfrost,[ 626 ]
robertfrost,"Milton’s pentameters go on to say,"
robertfrost,But Meicy fust and last shall brightest shine.
robertfrost,"Not only last, but first, you will observe,"
robertfrost,Which spoils your figure of the ambulance.
robertfrost,Keepei Paul only means you make too much of justice.
robertfrost,There’s some such thing and no one will deny
robertfrost,lt-
robertfrost,Enough to bait the trap of the ideal
robertfrost,From which theie can be no escape for us
robertfrost,But by our biting off our adolescence
robertfrost,And leaving it behind us m the trap.
robertfrost,"Jonah Listen, ye' It’s the proletaiiat!"
robertfrost,A 1 evolution’s coming down the street!
robertfrost,"Lights out, 1 say, so’s to escape attention."
robertfrost,(Hr snaps one bulb off Paul snaps on another)
robertfrost,"Jesse Bel You needn’t shout like that, you wretched"
robertfrost,man.
robertfrost,"Theie’s nothing coming on us, is there, Paul?"
robertfrost,We’ve had about enough of these sensations-
robertfrost,"It’s a coincidence, but we weie on"
robertfrost,The subject of the woikeis’ levolution
robertfrost,When vou came m. Were revolutionists.
robertfrost,Or Keepei is a revolutionist.
robertfrost,Paul almost had jioor Keepei in a comer
robertfrost,Wheio he would have to quit his politics
robertfrost,"Oi be a Christian. Paul, I wish you’d say"
robertfrost,"That over, f shall have to retail it"
robertfrost,"To some of Keeper’s friends that come m here,"
robertfrost,A bunch of smalltime revolutionaries.
robertfrost,[627 j
robertfrost,Paul makes it come out so they look like
robertfrost,Christians.
robertfrost,How they’ll like that. Paul said conservatives—
robertfrost,"You say it, Paul."
robertfrost,Paul You mean about success.
robertfrost,And how by its own logic it concentrates
robertfrost,All wealth and power in too few hands?
robertfrost,The rich in seeing nothing but injustice
robertfrost,In their impoverishment by revolution
robertfrost,Are right. But ’twas intentional injustice.
robertfrost,It was their justice being mercy-ciossed.
robertfrost,The revolution Keepers biinging on
robertfrost,Is nothing but an outbreak of mass mercy.
robertfrost,Too long pent up in ngorous convention—
robertfrost,A holy impulse towaids redistubution.
robertfrost,To set out to homogenize mankind
robertfrost,So that the cream could never rise again.
robertfrost,Required someone who laughingly could play
robertfrost,"With the idea of justice in the courts,"
robertfrost,Could mock at riches m the light it claims
robertfrost,To count on justice to be merely just.
robertfrost,"But we are talking over Jonah’s head,"
robertfrost,Or clear off what we know his interests are
robertfrost,Still not so far off come to think of it.
robertfrost,There is some justice even as Keeper says.
robertfrost,The thing that really counts though is the
robertfrost,form
robertfrost,Of outrage— violence— that bleaks across it.
robertfrost,The very sleep we sleep is an example
robertfrost,So that because we’re always starting fresh
robertfrost,The best minds are the best at premises.
robertfrost,[ 628 ]
robertfrost,And the most sacred thing of ail’s abruption.
robertfrost,And if you’ve got to see your justice crossed
robertfrost,(And you’ve got to) which will you prefer
robertfrost,"To see it, evil-crossed or mercv-ciossed?"
robertfrost,"Keeper We poets offer you anothei stai -crossed,"
robertfrost,"Of star-crossed, mercy-crossed, or evil-crossed"
robertfrost,I choose the star-crossed as a star-crossed
robertfrost,lover.
robertfrost,Jonah I think my trouble’s with the cnsises
robertfrost,Where mercy-crossed to me seemed evil-
robertfrost,crossed
robertfrost,"Keeper Good for you, Jonah. That’s what I’ve been"
robertfrost,saymg.
robertfrost,"For instance, when to purify the Itzas"
robertfrost,They took my love and threw her down a well.
robertfrost,Jesse Bel If it is me in my last incarnation
robertfrost,"He’s thinking of, it wasn’t down a well"
robertfrost,But in a butt of malmsey I was drowned.
robertfrost,Jonah Why do you call yourself a star-crossed lover?
robertfrost,Keeper Not everything I say is said in scorn.
robertfrost,Some people want you not to understand
robertfrost,"them,"
robertfrost,But I want you to understand me wrong.
robertfrost,Jonah I noticed how he just now made you out
robertfrost,A revolutionary— which of course you can t be.
robertfrost,[ 629 ]
robertfrost,Keeper Or not at least the ordinal y land
robertfrost,No revolution I bi ought on would aim
robertfrost,At anything but change of peisonnel
robertfrost,The Andrew Jackson slogan of Vae Victis
robertfrost,Or ‘Turn the rascals out’ would do for me
robertfrost,Paul Don’t you be made feel small by all this posing
robertfrost,Both of them caught it fiom Bel’s favorite
robertfrost,poet
robertfrost,Who m his favorite pose as poet thinker
robertfrost,(His was the doctune of the Seven Poses)
robertfrost,Once charged the Nazaiene with having
robertfrost,brought
robertfrost,A darkness out of Asia that had ciossed
robertfrost,Old Attic grace and Spaitan discipline
robertfrost,With violence The Greeks were hardly
robertfrost,strangers
robertfrost,To the idea of violence. It flourished
robertfrost,Persisting from old Chaos m their myth
robertfrost,To embroil the very gods about their spheres
robertfrost,Of influence It’s been a commonplace
robertfrost,Ever since Alexander Greeced the woild
robertfrost,’Twere nothing new if that weie all Chust
robertfrost,brought.
robertfrost,Christ came to introduce a bieak with logic
robertfrost,That made all other outrage seem as child’s
robertfrost,play:
robertfrost,The Mercy on the Sin against the Sermon
robertfrost,Strange no one ever thought of it before Him.
robertfrost,’Twas lovely and its oiigm was love.
robertfrost,Keeper We know what’s coming now
robertfrost,[ 630 ]
robertfrost,Paul
robertfrost,"You say it, Keeper,"
robertfrost,If you have learned youi lesson. Don’t be
robertfrost,bashful
robertfrost,Keeper Paul’s constant theme The Sermon on the
robertfrost,Mount
robertfrost,Is just a frame-up to insure the failuie
robertfrost,"Of all of us, so all of us will be"
robertfrost,Thrown prostrate at the Mercy Seat for Mercy
robertfrost,"Jesse Bel Yes, Paul, you do say things like that some-"
robertfrost,times
robertfrost,Paul You all have read the Sermon on the Mount.
robertfrost,I ask you all to lead it once again
robertfrost,(They put their hands together like a book
robertfrost,And hold it up nearsightedly to read )
robertfrost,Keeper and
robertfrost,Jesse Bel We’ie reading it
robertfrost,"Paul Well, now you’ve got it read."
robertfrost,What do you make of it?
robertfrost,Jesse Bel The same old nothing
robertfrost,Keeper A beautiful impossibility.
robertfrost,"Paul Keeper, I’m glad you think it beautiful"
robertfrost,Keeper An n resistible impossibility.
robertfrost,A lofty beauty no one can live up to
robertfrost,Yet no one turn fiom trying to live up to.
robertfrost,[ 631 ]
robertfrost,"Paul Yes, spoken so we can’t live up to it"
robertfrost,Yet so we’ll have to weep because we can’t
robertfrost,Meicy is only to the undeserving
robertfrost,But such we all are made m the sight of God.
robertfrost,"‘Oh, what is a king here."
robertfrost,And what is a booi?
robertfrost,Here all starve together
robertfrost,All dwarfed and poor.’
robertfrost,"Here we all fail together, dwarfed and poor."
robertfrost,"Failure is failure, but success is failure"
robertfrost,There is no better way of having it.
robertfrost,An end you can’t by any means achieve
robertfrost,"And yet can’t turn your back on or ignore,"
robertfrost,That is the mystery you must accept.
robertfrost,"Do you accept it, Master Jonas Dove?"
robertfrost,Jonah What do you say to it. My Brother’s Keeper?
robertfrost,Keeper I say I’d rather be lost in the woods
robertfrost,Than found in church.
robertfrost,Jonah That doesn’t help me much.
robertfrost,"Keeper Our disagreement when we disagree, Paul,"
robertfrost,"Lies in our different approach to Christ,"
robertfrost,"Yours more through Home, mine more thiough"
robertfrost,Palestine.
robertfrost,But let’s be serious about Paul’s offer.
robertfrost,"His irresistible impossibility,"
robertfrost,His lofty beauty no one can live up to
robertfrost,Yet no one turn away from or ignore—
robertfrost,I simply turn away from it.
robertfrost,[ 632 ]
robertfrost,Paul
robertfrost,You Pagan!
robertfrost,"Keeper Yes, call me Pagan, Paul, as if you meant it."
robertfrost,I won’t deceive myself about success
robertfrost,By making failure out of equal value.
robertfrost,Any equality they may exhibit’s
robertfrost,In making fools of people equally.
robertfrost,"Paul But you— what is your answer, Jonas Dove?"
robertfrost,Jonah You ask if I see yonder shining gate.
robertfrost,"And I reply I almost think I do,"
robertfrost,Beyond this great door you have locked
robertfrost,against me.
robertfrost,"Beyond the storm, beyond the universe."
robertfrost,"Paul Yes, Pilgrim now instead of runaway,"
robertfrost,Your fugitive escape become a quest.
robertfrost,Keeper Don’t let him make you see too bright a gate
robertfrost,Or you will come to with a foolish feeling.
robertfrost,When a great tide of argument sweeps in
robertfrost,My small fresh water spring gets drowned of
robertfrost,course.
robertfrost,But when the brine goes back as go it must
robertfrost,I can count on my source to spring again
robertfrost,Not even brackish from its salt experience.
robertfrost,No true source can be poisoned.
robertfrost,Jonah Then that’s all.
robertfrost,You’ve finished. I’m dismissed. I want to run
robertfrost,Toward what you make me see beyond the
robertfrost,world.
robertfrost,Unlock the door for me.
robertfrost,[ 633 ]
robertfrost,Keeper
robertfrost,Not that way out
robertfrost,Jonah I’m all turned round.
robertfrost,Paul Theie is youi way prepared
robertfrost,Jonah That’s not my door.
robertfrost,"Keeper No, that’s another door"
robertfrost,Your exit door’s become a cellai dooi.
robertfrost,(The door here opens darkhj of ilsclf)
robertfrost,Jonah You mean I’m being sent down m the cellar' 1
robertfrost,Paul You must make your descent like everyone.
robertfrost,Keeper Go if you’re going.
robertfrost,Jonah Who is sending me 11
robertfrost,"Whose cellar is it, youis 01 the apostle’s?"
robertfrost,"Keeper It is the cellar to my store Wluil ho, down"
robertfrost,there!
robertfrost,"My dungeoneers, come fetch us.— No one"
robertfrost,answers.
robertfrost,There’s not much we can do till Martin gets
robertfrost,here.—
robertfrost,Don’t let me scare you. I was only teasing
robertfrost,"It is the cellar to my store., but not my cellai"
robertfrost,Jesse has given Paul the lent of it
robertfrost,To base his campaign on to save the woild.
robertfrost,[ 634 ]
robertfrost,Jesse Bel Something’s the matter eveiyone admits.
robertfrost,On the off-chance it may be lack of faith
robertfrost,I have contributed the empty cellar
robertfrost,To Paul to see what he can do with it
robertfrost,To bring faith back I’m only languidly
robertfrost,Inclined to hope for much. Still what we need
robertfrost,"Is something to believe in, don’t we, Paul?"
robertfrost,Keeper By something to believe in Jesse means
robertfrost,Sometlnng to be fanatical about
robertfrost,So as to justify the orthodox
robertfrost,"In saving heretics by slaying them,"
robertfrost,"Not on the battlefield, but down in cellars."
robertfrost,That way’s been tried too many times for me.
robertfrost,I’d like to see the world tried once without it.
robertfrost,Jesse Bel The world seems crying out for a Messiah.
robertfrost,Keeper Haven’t you heard the news ' 5 We already have
robertfrost,"one,"
robertfrost,"And of the Messianic race, Karl Marx."
robertfrost,"Jesse Bel Light, brmg a light!"
robertfrost,"Keeper Awh, there’s no lack of light, you—"
robertfrost,A light that falls diffused over my shoulder
robertfrost,And is reflected from the printed page
robertfrost,And bed of world-flowers so as not to blind
robertfrost,me.
robertfrost,If even the face of man’s too bright a light
robertfrost,"To look at long directly (like the sun),"
robertfrost,Then how much more the face of truth must
robertfrost,be.
robertfrost,[ 635 ]
robertfrost,We were not given eyes or intellect
robertfrost,For all the light at once the source of light —
robertfrost,For wisdom that can have no counterwisdom.
robertfrost,In our subscription to the sentiment
robertfrost,Of one God we provide He shall be one
robertfrost,"Who can be many Gods to many men,"
robertfrost,"His church on earth a Roman Pantheon,"
robertfrost,Which is our greatest hope of rest from war
robertfrost,"Live and let live, believe and let believe"
robertfrost,’Twas said the lesser gods were only traits
robertfrost,Of the one awful God. Just so the saints
robertfrost,Are God’s white light refracted into colors.
robertfrost,"Jesse Bel Let’s change the subject, boys, I’m getting"
robertfrost,nervous.
robertfrost,Keeper Nervous is all the great things ever made you.
robertfrost,But to repeat and get it thiough your head:
robertfrost,We have all the belief that’s good for us.
robertfrost,Too much all-fired behef and we’d be back
robertfrost,Down burning skeptics m the cellar furnace
robertfrost,"Like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego."
robertfrost,Jonah What’s all this talk of slaying down in cellars—
robertfrost,So sinister? You spoke to someone down there.
robertfrost,"Keeper My friends and stokeis, JefTeis and O’Neill"
robertfrost,They fail me. Now I’m teasing you again.
robertfrost,There’s no one down there getting tortured
robertfrost,save
robertfrost,A penitent perhaps self-llnown on Mercy.
robertfrost,Jonah I heard a deep groan— maybe out of him.
robertfrost,What’s really down there?
robertfrost,[ 636 ]
robertfrost,"Paul Just an oubliette,"
robertfrost,Where you must he m self-forgetfulness
robertfrost,On the wet flags befoie a ciucifix
robertfrost,I have had painted on the cellar wall
robertfrost,By a religious Aztec Indian.
robertfrost,Jonah Then it’s not lethal— to get nd of me?
robertfrost,Have they been down?
robertfrost,Paul Not in the proper spirit.
robertfrost,These two are stubborn children as you see.
robertfrost,Their case is not so simple. You are good.
robertfrost,Jonah I am your convert Tell me what I think
robertfrost,My trouble has been with my sense of justice.
robertfrost,And you say justice doesn’t leally matter
robertfrost,Paul Does it to you as greatly as it did?
robertfrost,Jonah I own the need of it had somewhat faded
robertfrost,Even before I came m here tonight
robertfrost,Paul Well then!
robertfrost,Jonah And that’s what I’m to meditate?
robertfrost,Paul Meditate nothing. Learn to contemplate.
robertfrost,Contemplate glory. There will be a light.
robertfrost,Contemplate Truth until it bums your eyes
robertfrost,out.
robertfrost,I don’t see any staircase.

robertfrost,"Jonah If what you say is tiue, if winning uinks"
robertfrost,"The same with God as losing, how explain"
robertfrost,Our making all this effoit mortals make?
robertfrost,"Keeper Good for you, Jonah That’s what I’ve been"
robertfrost,saying
robertfrost,Jonah You’ll tell me sometime All you say has gieat-
robertfrost,ness
robertfrost,Yet your fnend heie can’t be quite disie-
robertfrost,garded.
robertfrost,Keeper I say we keep linn till we wring some moie
robertfrost,Naiveness about Justice out of him.
robertfrost,As once the Pharaoh did it out of Sekhti
robertfrost,By having him whipped eveiv day alicsh
robertfrost,For clamoring for justice at the gate
robertfrost,Until the scribes had taken down a bookful
robertfrost,For distribution to his buieauciats.
robertfrost,Jonah I’m going now. But don’t you push me off.
robertfrost,Keeper I was supporting you for feai you’d famt
robertfrost,From disillusionment. You’ve had to take it.
robertfrost,(Jonah steps on the threshold as the door
robertfrost,Slams in his face. The blow and the repulse
robertfrost,Crumple him on the floor. Keeper and Paul
robertfrost,Kneel by him. Bel stands up beside her chair
robertfrost,"As if to come , but Keeper waves her off)"
robertfrost,[ 638 ]
robertfrost,Jonah I think I may have got God wrong entirely.
robertfrost,Keeper All of us get each other pretty wrong.
robertfrost,"Jesse Bel Now we have done it, Paul What did he say?"
robertfrost,"Jonah I should have warned you, though my sense"
robertfrost,of justice
robertfrost,Was about all there ever was to me.
robertfrost,When that fades I fade— every time I fade
robertfrost,Mercy on me for having thought I knew.
robertfrost,Jesse Bel What did he say? I can’t hear what he says
robertfrost,Paul Mercy on him for having asked for justice.
robertfrost,"Keeper Die saying that, old-fashioned sapient."
robertfrost,"You poor old sape, if I may com the slang."
robertfrost,"We like you, don’t we, Paul? ( Paul takes his"
robertfrost,wrist)
robertfrost,Jesse Bel ( Still standing off) We’ve all grown fond of
robertfrost,you.
robertfrost,Paul We’ve all grown fond of you. ( Paul says it
robertfrost,"louder,"
robertfrost,But Jonah gives no sign of having heard )
robertfrost,Keeper Who said too late you cannot enter now?
robertfrost,Jesse Bel He was rejected for his reservations!
robertfrost,Keeper ( Still on his knees he sits back on his heels)
robertfrost,But one thing more before the curtain falls.
robertfrost,[ 639 ]
robertfrost,(The curtain starts to fall) Please hold the
robertfrost,Curtain-
robertfrost,"All Paul means, and I wish the dead could"
robertfrost,hear me.
robertfrost,"All you mean, Paul, I think—"
robertfrost,se Bel Will you stand theie
robertfrost,And let that tell you what you think like that 0
robertfrost,Paul Suffer a fnend to try to word you better.
robertfrost,"se Bel Oh, theie’s to be a funeral oration."
robertfrost,And were an orator. Get up. Stand up
robertfrost,"For what you think your doctor thinks, why"
robertfrost,don’t you?
robertfrost,Don’t wear your pants out pieachmg on your
robertfrost,knees.
robertfrost,Save them to say your prayers on.— What’s
robertfrost,the matter?
robertfrost,"leeper (He doesn’t rise, but looks at her a moment)"
robertfrost,"Lady, at such a time, and in the Presence!"
robertfrost,I won’t presume to tell Bel where to go
robertfrost,But if this prophet s mantle fell on me
robertfrost,I should dare say she would be taken care of.
robertfrost,"We send our wicked enemies to Hell,"
robertfrost,Our wicked friends we send to Purgatory.
robertfrost,But Bel gets some things right— and she was
robertfrost,right—
robertfrost,(She startles at the sudden note of kindness )
robertfrost,I am right then?
robertfrost,[ 640 ]
robertfrost,e Bel
robertfrost,Keeper
robertfrost,In glorifying courage.
robertfrost,"Courage is of the heart by derivation,"
robertfrost,And gieat it is But fear is of the soul.
robertfrost,And I’m afraid ( The bulb lights sicken down.
robertfrost,The cellar door swings wide and slams again)
robertfrost,Paul The fear that you’re afraid with is the fear
robertfrost,Of God’s decision lastly on your deeds.
robertfrost,That is the Fear of God whereof ’tis written
robertfrost,Keeper But not the fear of punishment for sin
robertfrost,(I have to sin to prove it isn’t that).
robertfrost,I’m 110 more governed by the fear of Hell
robertfrost,"Than by the fear of the asylum, jail, or poor-"
robertfrost,house.
robertfrost,The basic three the state is founded on.
robertfrost,But I’m too much afraid of God to claim
robertfrost,I have been fighting on the angels’ side.
robertfrost,That is for Him and not for me to say
robertfrost,For me to say it would be irreligious.
robertfrost,(Sometimes I think you are too sure you have
robertfrost,been.)
robertfrost,And I can see that the uncertainty
robertfrost,"In which we act is a seveiity,"
robertfrost,"A cruelty, amounting to injustice"
robertfrost,That nothing but God’s mercy can assuage.
robertfrost,"I can sec that, if that is what you mean."
robertfrost,"Give me a hand up, if we are agreed"
robertfrost,"Paul Yes, there you have it at the root of things."
robertfrost,We have to stay afraid deep in our souls
robertfrost,"Our sacrifice, the best we have to offer,"
robertfrost,"And not our worst nor second best, our best,"
robertfrost,[ 641 ]
robertfrost,"Our very best, our lives laid down like Jonah’s,"
robertfrost,"Our lives laid down m war and peace, may not"
robertfrost,Be found acceptable in Heaven’s sight
robertfrost,And that they may be is the only prayer
robertfrost,Worth praying May my saciifice
robertfrost,Be found acceptable in Heaven’s sight
robertfrost,Keeper Let the lost millions pray it in the dark!
robertfrost,My failure is no diffeient from Jonah’s.
robertfrost,We both have lacked the couiage in the heart
robertfrost,To overcome the fear withni the soul
robertfrost,And go ahead to any accomplishment.
robertfrost,Courage is what it takes and takes the more of
robertfrost,Because the deeper fear is so eternal.
robertfrost,And if I say we lift him from the floor
robertfrost,And lay him where you ordered him to lie
robertfrost,"Before the cross, it is from fellow feeling."
robertfrost,As if I asked for one more chance myself
robertfrost,To learn to say (He mooes to Jonah’s feet )
robertfrost,Nothing can make injustice just but mercy
