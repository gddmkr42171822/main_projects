Final Group Project 
==================

Your project should: 

* Have readily available data
* Be of general interest (there should be published guidelines for what constitutes "standard" performance) and should be a problem worth tackling
* Be of specific interest to machine learning: there should be clear and obvious application of the techniques we have used in the course
* Have a baseline that you can implement (or run yourself) easily within a week
* Involve a fair amount of implementation.  If your entire implementation is one call to sklearn then you are not working hard enough. 

Groups
==================

You must form a group of 3-5 students enrolled in this course.  If you have a project idea and you're not able to convince two other people to work on it, it's probably not that interesting.  You should instead join another group.  

Proposal
==================

The project proposal is due be 23:55 October 28th.  This one page PDF document
should describe:

* What the project is. You must describe the task, data, and baselines clearly.

* Who is on your team

* What techniques you will explore 

* Your timeline for completing the project (be realistic; you should
  have your first results by November 18th)

Have the person in your group whose name is alphabetically first
submit your assignment on Moodle.  Late days cannot be used on this
assignment. 

Data and Baseline Milestone 
============================

By 23:55 on November 18th the person in your group whose last name is alphabetically first should submit a brief (1-2 page) PDF document  describing your data and the results of your baseline model to Moodle. 

Project Writeup
======================

By 23:55 on Dec 9th, have the person in your group whose last name is alphabetically first submit your project writeup in PDF format  explaining what you did and what results you achieved on Moodle.  This document should make it clear:

* What you did
* Why this is a good idea
* Whether your technique worked or not
* Who did what

The writeup should be between 2500 and 3000 words in length. 
Images are a much better use of space than words, usually (there's no
limit on including images, but use your judgement and include only 
images that add to the discussion).

Final Video Presentation
========================

Before 23:55 on Dec 9th the person in your group whose last name is alphabetically first should upload a 10-15 min video to YouTube presenting your results.  In your presentation you will explain: 

* What you did

* Who did what

* What challenges you had

* Review how well you did 

* Discuss some possible extensions on how you could do better  

The format of the video is not generally important, but we should 
be able to clearly see your slides and understand what you are saying. 
One possible option for your video format might be to film yourselves speaking
in front of your slides in a room with a projector.  Filming with a 
reasonably modern smartphone should be more than sufficient.   Alternatively 
you could do a screencast similar to my videos for this course.  With the 
exception of my writing tablet (which is arguably worth less than 0) everything
I use to film and edit my videos is freely available online. 

When your video is online you should send me the link.  Note that if you don't want your video out there for the entire world to see you can mark the video as unlisted so that only people with the link can view it.  I will make a master list of video links on GitHub so that your classmates can see what you've been up to all semester. 


Grade
======================

The grade will be out of 100 points, broken into five areas:

* _Presentation_: For your video presentation, do you highlight what you did and make people care?  Did you use time well during the presentation?

* _Writeup_: Does the writeup explain what you did in a way that is clear and effective?

* _Technical Soundness_: Did you use the right tools for the job, and did you use them correctly?  Were they relevant to this class?

* _Effort_: Did you do what you say you would, and was it the right amount of effort.

* _Performance_: How did your techniques perform?
